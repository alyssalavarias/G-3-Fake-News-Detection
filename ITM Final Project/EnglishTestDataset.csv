"The United States was aiming for the “grand slam” at this year’s Miss World beauty pageant, focused on winning the crown to add to the Miss Universe title won earlier this year by Miss U.S.A. Olivia Culpo.Olivia Jordan (yes, another Olivia), U.S.A.’s entry to this pretigious pageant held over the weekend in the Indonesian resort of Bali, made it to the top 10 contestants during Saturday’s finals, but not to the top 5.Miss Philippines, Megan Young, an early favorite in the competition, went on to win the title, the first ever by a Filipina in Miss World’s 62-year history. Miss France was first runner-up and Miss Ghana came in third.Less than 24 hours after the pageant finals, the U.S. filed a formal protest with the Miss World pageant organizers, saying that Young should be credited as a U.S. entry as well. Young was born in the United States to an American father and Filipina mother, but moved at age 10 to the Philippines where she is currentlly a model, actress and television host. “Technically, she is also Miss U.S.A,” the protest document indicated. “Even her surname is very American. Can’t she be at least declared as a ‘dual contestant’ by virtue of her dual citizenship?” it added.Miss World owner Julia Morley has not returned calls from The Adobo Chronicles seeking comment on the U.S. protest.",0

"Representative Gary Alejano has a lot of time on his hands.Just after returning from The Netherlands where he and Senator Antonio Trillanes submitted a complaint against President Duterte before the International Criminal Court, the Akbayan Partylist Representative now wants a name change for the Philippines.Under House Bill 5867, Alejano proposed the creation of a “Geographic Renaming Commission” which would “study the possibility and the feasibility of renaming our country.”The lawmaker, a former Marine captain turned mutineer, said the possible name should “appropriately address and define us as a people and nation.”Alejano explained that renaming the country would rid it of the vestiges of colonialism; establish the national identity; and define how the nation, people, and national language would be addressed internationally.So, in order to assist the future commission (which will have a budget of P30 Million) in coming up with a final decision, The Adobo Chronicles is conducting a nationwide poll on what our readers think would be the best and most appropriate new name for the Philippines.We propose the following five names:Kingdom of Lapu-LapuAdobo RepublicBaboy-an IslandsLaylayan IslandsFacifica FalayfayPlease vote in our poll:",0
"The provincial board of North Cotabato on Tuesday placed the entire province under a state of calamity due to natural and man-made calamities that hit the province this year.Board member Rolly Sacdalan said the provincial council passed Resolution No. 10 in response to recommendation by the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC).Sacdalan said the province was hit by both floods and armed hostilities perpetrated by outlawed elements that led to the displacement of civilians.Hit by calamities were Kidapawan City and the towns of Makilala, Pigcawayan, Tulunan, Kabacan, Pikit, Carmen, Alamada, Magpet, and Antipas.The calamities affected more than 10,000 farmers and destroyed crops and infrastructure amounting to P400 million.Among the man-made calamities that hit the province was the attack by outlawed Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters in Malagakit town that left two persons dead and about 3,000 villagers displaced.The attackers also vandalized a chapel in Barangay Malagakit, Pigcawayan, North Cotabato.Floods also hit the villages in the borders of North Cotabato and Maguindanao due to torrential rains affecting Mindanao in June and July.In January this year, more than 100 inmates of the North Cotabato District Jail escaped after gunmen attacked the jail facility to rescue comrades from detention.",1
"SENATE Minority Leader Franklin Drilon and Sen. Juan Miguel Zubiri believe that the Senate’s version of the Bangsamoro Basic Law is “more compliant” with the Constitution than the bill passed by the House of Representatives.Drilon on Saturday identified at least 10 major differences between the two measures that must be ironed out during the bicameral conference committee meeting.Zubiri, chairman of the Senate subcommittee on BBL, who sponsored the passage of Senate Bill 1717, said the bicam meeting to reconcile the conflicting would be held from July 9 to July 13.The Senate contingent in the bicam is composed of Senators Juan Edgardo Angara, Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel, Sherwin Gatchalian, Joel Villanueva, Francis Escudero, Loren Legarda, Risa Hontiveros, Francis Pangilinan, Drilon, and Zubiri.The Senate and the House passed their respective BBL measures that will abolish the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and replace it with the Autonomous Region for the Bangsamoro (ARB) before Congress adjourned on May 30.“I strongly believe that our version is more compliant to the provisions of the (1987) Constitution,” Drilon said in a radio interview.“For example, in one of my amendments I said that all those residing in the Bangsamoro (region) are citizens of the Philippines. That’s one of the requirements to make it constitutional,” he said.Asked whether the Senate version must prevail over the House version, Drilon said, “It is up to the [Senate] majority [bloc]. I don’t have the control.”“I think our version, with due respect to Congress, will pass the test of constitutionality if someone questions it before the Supreme Court,” Zubiri said in another radio interview.“They (senators) always add the phrase ‘within the framework of the 1987 Constitution,’ in the almost 150 amendments that they introduced to address issues on constitutionality,” he added.Drilon said the Senate’s version maintains the 39 municipalities in North Cotabato as part of the territorial jurisdiction of the ARB. The House version deletes the 39 municipalities as part of the core areas that comprise the ARB.“This could be a sticky point that both chambers should be able to smooth out when it goes to the bicameral conference committee for reconciliation,” he added.He proposed various amendments to the Senate version “in order to make sure that the measure will not suffer the same fate as the Memorandum of Agreement on the Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD),” the proposed BBL crafted under the Arroyo administration.The Senate adopted the changes to the powers to be given to the Bangsamoro proposed by Drilon, deleting provisions pertaining to the “reserved, concurrent and exclusive powers” of the Bangsamo government and removing the powers to conduct inquiries, in aid of legislation, and subpoena powers of the Parliament to be headed by a chief minister.The House version retained the provisions on reserved, concurrent and exclusive powers.In the version of the House of Representatives, the province of Palawan is included in the list of areas considered as historically part of Bangsamoro territory.The Senate also added a provision stating that the Bangsamoro people are citizens of the Philippines pursuant to Article 4 of the Constitution, an amendment pushed by Drilon. The said provision is absent in the House version.Drilon said the Senate and the House must “work hard” to reconcile their differences pertaining to the share of the national government of taxes collected in the Bangsamoro, other than tariff and customs duties.The House proposed 25% share for the national government and 75% for Bangsamoro, while the Senate wanted a 50-50 sharing.Also among the “sticky issues” that both chambers will have to reconcile is the prohibition on political dynasties, which is highly opposed by the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC).The Senate version prohibits a party representative from being related within the second degree of consanguinity or affinity to a district representative or another party representative in the same Parliament. There is no counterpart provision in the House version.The Senate also provided a qualification on the “block grant” which states that when the national government incurs an unmanageable public sector deficit, the President of the Philippines is authorized, upon the recommendation of the Department of Finance (DoF) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) secretaries to make the necessary adjustments in the block grant. The House version does not contain such a provision.The Senate version also prevents the Bangsamoro Parliament from including the procurement of firearms, ammunition and explosives in its annual appropriations law. The House version does not contain such a provision.The Senate proposed detailed provisions on the Bangsamoro Regional Police, including the selection of a regional director by the chief minister from a list of nominees submitted by the Philippine National Police Senior Officers Placement and Promotion Board.In the House version, it is the secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) who will appoint the regional director.The Senate also removed a provision for the creation of Shari’ah Judicial and Bar Council (JBC), which will recommend nominees to the Shari’ah Courts. The House retained the provision.",1
"It was Kris Aquino’s dream gig. A big way to stage her comeback from her on-again, off-again retirement from show business.When the Miss Universe Organization announced its search for a Filipino female co-host for the pageant finals to be held in Manila on January 29 (January 30 Philippine time), the former presidential sister and “Queen of All Media” immediately signed up to audition for the prized gig.Today, Aquino received a text message from the organization that she has not been selected to be Steve Harvey’s co-host.The disappointing news became even more devastating when she learned that the person chosen to co-host the show is entertainer-turned-politcal blogger Mocha Uson.In an exclusive interview with The Adobo Chronicles, a spokesperson for the Miss Universe Organization who spoke on condition of anonymity said that despite the two ladies’ almost equal talent, Uson was chosen because of her popularity (she has over 4 million Facebook followers). Additionally, the pageant executives wanted someone who looks like a beauty queen and whose features closely represent the Filipina beauty.So ladies, if you want to increase your chances in show business, forget the skin-whitener and hair dye. You’re beautiful as you are. Naturally.",0
"Whether the powerful Commission on Appointments (CA) will confirm Regina Lopez’s appointment as secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) will be known today, Wednesday, but two senators already expressed support for her.Senate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto 3rd and Sen. Emmanuel Pacquiao on Tuesday said they would vote in favor of Lopez’s confirmation because they want to have an environmentalist leading the DENR.Pacquiao, who heads the CA committee on environment and natural resources, said Lopez’s chances of being confirmed by the commission remain “50-50.”“Meron ayaw, meron gusto, iba iba eh hindi naman natin makuha kung ano ang desisyon nila [There are those who are for her confirmation and some are not, they have different views and it is up to them],” he added, referring to members of the CA.When asked if he would vote in favor of Lopez, Pacquiao said there is no reason for him not to because he considers the DENR secretary as his partner in protecting the environment.“Why would I not support her? We’re together. Were both environmentalists,” he added.Lopez faced the members of the CA committee on environment on Tuesday for her to shed light on various issues raised by those opposing her appointment.The DENR secretary assured the CA committee that she would not do anything illegal in the department.“I want to assure the commission that I’m a law-abiding citizen. I will never do anything in the DENR that is against the law,” Lopez said.The CA committee terminated its deliberations on Lopez’s appointment and will meet today to decide if it would endorse her nomination to the floor.Sotto said that he would vote for the confirmation of Lopez because he believes that she would be “good” for the department.He noted that there are no corruption issues hounding Lopez.“Among the issues against her is that she does not know how to sing? Is that enough to disqualify a Cabinet member?” Sotto said.",1
"In her syndicated column Wednesday, conservative columnist Ann Coulter delivered what many consider to be the harshest judgment ever of the sport of soccer. Her piece comes right smack in the middle of the FIFA World Cup in Brazil. She was obviously going for the ratings.“No American whose great-grandfather was born here is watching soccer. One can only hope that, in addition to learning English, these new Americans (referring to immigrants) will drop their soccer fetish with time,” Coulter began her sourgrape rant. She described any growing interest in soccer to be a sign of the nation’s moral decay.She then continued by belittling soccer moms. “Liberal moms like soccer because it’s a sport in which athletic talent finds so little expression that girls can play with boys,” she said.Well, it turns out that Coulter’s hatred for soccer began many years ago when she started dating men. Coulter has been engaged several times but never married. All her fiancés cancelled their engagement with her and left her for … young soccer single moms.Now you know.Here’s Coulter’s column.",0
"Some 200 applicants, out of the 500 job seekers, were asked to report to various agencies for further assessment after passing the initial screening during the first Jobs Fair for Senior High School graduates at the provincial gymnasium here on Thursday.The Jobs Fair, organized by the provincial government in partnership with the Department of Education (DepEd) Division of Cavite, offered more than 3,600 job placement opportunities from its 13 participating companies in the field of manufacturing, production, retail, merchandise, exporting and process outsourcing.Cavite Schools Divisions Superintendent Cherry Lou D. De Mesa said the jobs fair served as a venue to inspire and motivate new graduates and job seekers to have a good perspective in life with decent opportunities coming their way.Aside from job opportunities, applicants also took advantage of the government caravan to inquire or apply for their Social Security System (SSS), PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG fund numbers, some of the basic employment documentary requirements.Aside from DepEd, Thursday’s event was also attended by personnel from Cavite Office of Public Safety (COPS), Provincial Information and Community Affairs Department (PICAD) and General Services Office.",1
"(Last of two parts)THE PIONEER cohort of senior high school (SHS) students started enrollment nationwide today, a month earlier than the rest of the basic education students.Education Secretary Armin Luistro, FSC, said the early enrollment would give his department time to make necessary adjustments should the number of Grade 11 students turn out much larger than the preregistration count in October last year.All of their preparations, he said, have been based on the preregistration data, particularly those relating to school and track preferences of the students.The Inquirer ran the first part of this primer on Sunday to fill the gaps in information among parents, present and future SHS students, and the general public about the last two grades in the K-12 education reform. Here is Part 2.What are the core subjects?The SHS curriculum is made up of core subjects in eight learning areas that all SHS students will have to take, as well as applied and specialized track subjects which will be dictated by the track and the strand that a student chooses.These are Oral Communication, Reading and Writing, Komunikasyon at Pananaliksik sa Wika at Kulturang Filipino, Pagbasa at Pagsusuri ng Iba’t Ibang Teksto Tungo sa Pananaliksik, 21st Century Literature from the Philippines and the World, Contemporary Philippine Arts from the Regions, Media and Information Literacy, General Mathematics, Statistics and Probability, Earth and Life Science, Physical Science, Introduction to Philosophy of the Human Person, Physical Education and Health, Personal Development, and Understanding Culture, Society and Politics. For the students under the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) strand, Earth Science replaces Earth and Life Science and Disaster Readiness and Risk Reduction replaces Physical Science.Why are they not familiar high school subjects?They are not because the more familiar subjects are in junior high school. The SHS curriculum has been integrated with some subjects in the College General Education curriculum with the approval of the Commission on Higher Education, which subjects will be deleted from the college curriculum so students may focus more on courses relevant to their degree programs.What are SHS tracks?SHS tracks are specific areas of study much like college courses and they fall under four disciplines, namely, Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL), Sports, and Arts & Design. These are the subjects that will give you the competencies and advanced skills required in college or tech-voc education, entrepreneurship, employment and, most important, life.The Academic track has four strands: Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM); Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics; Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS); and General Academic (GAS).The TVL track also has four strands: Home Economics (HE), Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Agri-Fishery Arts and Industrial Arts.How do students select a track?Students should ask themselves this question: What do I want to do after high school graduation? SHS is supposed to help lead students toward a career path.Laurd Menhard Bautista Salen of Barangka, Marikina City, who preenrolled at Technological Institute of the Philippines in Quezon City, has chosen the HUMSS strand under the Academic track because it “will develop the reading and writing skills that will prepare me for college where I’m going to take up mass communications.”Jay Anne Torres Cipriano of Olongapo City preregistered for STEM under the Academic track at The Manila Times College of Subic “to have sufficient fundamentals in engineering because I’d like to pursue geological engineering in college.”Kristin Hans V. Santos of Bocaue, Bulacan province, preenrolled in ABM at Manila Central University in Caloocan City because she wants to be “a successful businesswoman someday.” She believes “the world changes because of the business people who manipulates it.”Ronn Jayvier M. Gonzales will be taking the ICT strand under the TVL track at System Technology Institute (STI) in Balagtas, Bulacan province, because “I want to learn new things” and he thinks information technology “will lead me to a successful life.”The most flexible strand, according to Department of Education (DepEd) Assistant Secretary Elvin T. Uy, is the GAS because it will allow students to try one or two subjects in the STEM, one or two in tech-voc, and other electives for which the SHS has the facilities and the teachers.Campaigns to encourage students to go into the STEM have not had salutary effects on incoming Grade 11 students. Based on preregistration data, only 8 percent chose the STEM strand. But here is the good news: 40 percent will follow the tech-voc track.How can SHS students study so many core subjects and track subjects in just two years?“Think in terms of semesters,” Luistro said. Students will be taught different core subjects every semester. They will also choose different electives every semester. Some subjects will require two quarters only.It is a misconception that the SHS curriculum is congested, according to Uy. Just like in Grades 1 to 6 and Grades 7 to 10, there are eight subjects in Grades 11 and 12.“But just like in college, the lineup of subjects changes every semester,” Uy said. Students can have, for example, four core subjects plus three specialized subjects in one semester.Why aren’t all SHS offering all the tracks?Schools can only offer tracks where they can optimize their facilities and teaching resources as well as best meet the local community’s demands. If their selected tracks are not available in the public school where they finished Grade 10, students can either go to another public SHS or use their vouchers to go to a private or non-DepEd school offering their tracks.What happens when a student changes tracks?The DepEd advises students and parents to weigh the possibilities and consider the consequences of changing tracks. To illustrate: A student who chooses the STEM takes up in the first semester four core subjects, an applied subject and a specialized subject, say, Basic Calculus. In the second semester, she decides to shift to the Art and Design track. What will happen is that the four core subjects will be credited but the Basic Calculus will not be credited under Arts and Design, so in effect she will have one back subject. If the school offers that back subject in the second semester, no problem. If not, she might have to take it in the summer or it is possible her studies will be delayed.What about the teacher requirements?The DepEd is hiring more than 36,000 teachers out of the 47,000 who applied to teach in SHS. The department started accepting applications in October last year and, after screening, started hiring two months ago. Uy is confident there will be no teacher shortage. Hiring is not limited to licensed teachers. Luistro said they would welcome experts and practitioners to teach the specialized subjects part-time.Teacher training, which is ongoing, is specific to specialization. For the Academic track, the DepEd is working with colleges and universities and centers of excellence. For the TVL, it has partnered with Technical Education and Skills Development Authority. For the Sports track, the department has teamed up with Philippine Normal University, which has a good sports education program. And for Arts and Design, the DepEd tapped the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.Why should students bother with SHS?For students with typical Filipino parents, the most compelling reason is that without the SHS diploma, they cannot be admitted to a university.For students who must earn a living right after or even during SHS, more employment opportunities will await them for several reasons. For one, partnerships with different companies for tech-voc courses will give students actual work experience that may lead to immediate hiring.For students who are being groomed to run the family business or are interested in starting their own business, SHS offers an entrepreneurship subject that will give them the competencies to create a marketable product, design a business plan, understand manpower, materials and markets, among other things.What should Grade 11 students and their parents prepare for when school opens?They should be prepared for birth pangs that accompany a pioneering effort.",1
"As Vladimir Putin’s government continues to come under fire for the recent crackdown on homosexuality in Russia, the Russian president’s lavish lifestyle is also gaining closer scrutiny. In addition to private planes and yachts at his disposal, Putin has 20 palaces to spend time in at his beck and call. One of these palaces is located in Lake Valdai in the middle of the Valdai Hills in Novgorod Oblast, Russia.Putin spent last weekend in this grandiose palace which has a cinema, two restaurants and bowling alley. Eyewitness reports emanating from the palace’s staff of butlers and chambermaids confirmed that while vacationing at the palace, a surreal incident happened. As Putin was preparing to retire for the evening, he heard some loud music coming from the palace’s cinema. Putin immediately descended the spiral staircase across from his bedroom and entered the cinema which was located on the ground floor of the two-story south wing of the palace.What Putin saw shocked him. It was a film showing composer Peter Tchaikovsky conducting the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra. The orchestra was playing music from Swan Lake. As the camera panned to a stage above the orchestra pit, two male dancers were seen pirouetting and crisscrossing the breadth of the huge stage in what was obviously a scene depicting lovers. Putin immediately recognized the dancers: an aging Vaslav Nijinsky and a young Rudolf Nureyev. As the orchestra executed a loud crescendo, the two men kissed and a white transparent curtain quickly dropped in front of the dancers, followed by a text credit projected onto the curtain which read, “Choreographed by Serge Diaghilev.”Putin, of course, knew that all the characters he saw on the cinema screen, incuding the choreographer, were among Russia’s famous homosexuals. Eyewitnesses couldn’t tell whether Putin was bothered or amused by the homosexual ghosts.There is no word from Putin or his press corps on whether this surreal experience would change his mind regarding his controversial policy on homosexuality in Russia.",0
"It is the Catholic Church’s mandate to speak out against the continuing gangland-style street executions of drug suspects resulting from the Duterte administration’s war on drugs, the head of the Cebu archdiocese, the country’s biggest in terms of population, said.“If the President believes that killing people is the way to solve the drug problem in the country, we in the Church believe otherwise,” said Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma, who heads a flock of at least two million Catholics.“We will not stop talking about what we believe is right and true because that’s our mandate,” he said.Palma made the statements when asked to react to President Rodrigo Duterte’s latest invectives-laden rant against the Church’s continuing criticism of his brutal war on drugs, which has already claimed the lives of 7,000 men and women from urban poor communities.In a speech in Cagayan de Oro City, Mr. Duterte blasted the Church anew, accusing it again of hypocrisy and obstructing his vision of a drug-free Philippines instead of helping.“We forgive him,” said Palma of the President’s insults against the Church.“Why should we get hurt?” Palma said in an interview after celebrating Mass for the 103rd birthday of Teofilo Camomot, a Cebuano bishop who is candidate for sainthood.Palma urged the faithful to pray for the President instead.But contrary to the President’s accusation that the Church is an obstructionist in the war on drugs, Palma said the Church was active in fighting the drug menace not by killing people but by giving them hope.“A lot of things are being done by the Church long before he (Mr. Duterte) assumed the presidency,” said Palma.He said these activities were not publicized, which was being used to justify accusations that the Church was doing nothing to fight the drug menace.“We don’t let our left hand know what the right hand is doing,” said Palma.“Deep in our hearts, we know we have done quite a number of things for the good of the people,” he said.He did not elaborate on Church programs related to the fight against drugs, but on Friday, Palma led graduation rites for the sixth batch of drug users who finished a rehabilitation program, known as “Surrender to God,” in the town of Liloan, northern Cebu.Since July, at least 100 drug users had gone through rehabilitation under Surrender to God and another Church-initiated program, Lahat Labang, in Liloan.Two weeks ago, Palma launched the Cebu Archdiocesan Program for Drug Dependents to expand the Church’s campaign to save drug users.Palma said the Church was not opposed to Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, but on how it was being carried out.",1
"Malacañang shrugged off calls made by three U.S. senators for the State Department to review its process of extending aid to the Philippines amid what they call “a campaign of mass atrocities” by the government of President Rodrigo Duterte.Senators Edward Markey, Marco Rubio, and Christopher Coon, in a letter dated December 22, said the president’s so-called war on drugs or Project Tokhang “appears to be a campaign of mass atrocities thinly disguised as a response to a public health emergency.”It was addressed to assistant secretary William Brownfield of the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella declined to comment on the matter on Tuesday, December 27, simply saying that “they (three US senators) are entitled to their own opinions.”Markey, Rubio and Coons expressed concern about reports of “at least 2,000 extrajudicial killings” and “another 3,800 deaths” that they said resulted from “inadequately investigated homicides believed to be connected to the campaign.”They also slammed Duterte’s plan to “to kill another 20,000 to 30,000 people, many simply because they suffer from a drug use disorder” instead of doing ways to “address the systemic problems related to the country’s drug crisis, invest in treatment programs, or approach the epidemic with an emphasis on the health and well-being of the Philippine people.”The senators called on Washington to review and scrutinize its financial aid to the Philippines, especially the $32-million funding for training and other law-enforcement assistance pledged by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to ensure that “no foreign assistance is being provided to support egregious acts against humanity.”Duterte had consistently denied his government’s involvement in extrajudicial killings, defending the police operations as legitimate.He had also lambasted the U.S. for its criticisms on Duterte’s human rights record, having already declared it can live without U.S. aid following its rapprochement with China, which expressed readiness to provide assistance.",1
"The fact alone that reproductive health is so ""controversial"" in the Philippines already says a lot about our society. It is like two frogs in a pot of water being slowly heated to boiling point debating the finer details around the pros and cons of hopping out of said pot.Population growth, like environmental degradation is a slow disaster. It does not happen in a big catastrophic bang that galvanises people to action. Instead, it creeps up slowly enough not to disturb the trajectory of the comfy momentum that the current paradigm is riding upon.It takes a lot of intelligence and mental discipline to see slow disasters for what they are and implement the appropriate measures in a systematic way to arrest its slow erosion of the quality of our lives. It is time we step up to the challenge and prove our collective intelligence and together muster the mental discipline to overcome the onslaught of this *preventable* catastrophe.",0

"Sen. Grace Poe on Friday vowed to push for the final approval of the P8.73-billion fund for the national feeding program in next year’s budget.Saying the “nutri-meals” program would be a “safety net” for malnourished students, Poe said this would cover all “severely wasted,” or those with chronic malnutrition, and “wasted” pupils to improve their nutritional status at the end of 120 feeding days and increase their classroom attendance and performance.The outlay will be sourced from the budget allocated for the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). It will get a P5.3-billion share from DepEd’s budget and P3.43 billion from DSWD.“Ten billion pesos is a small price given the massive positive effect that can be achieved through this program,” Poe said.A staunch advocate of free nutri-meals for students, Poe cosponsored the Senate bill creating a national school feeding program.",1
"Persons with disability (PWD) can soon buy some products and avail of services without paying additional taxes.They will have to thank Republic Act (RA) 10754, or An Act Expanding the Benefits and Privileges of Persons With Disability (PWDs), whose Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) will soon be in place eight months after the law took effect on March 23.Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo said RA 10754 will give additional value-added tax exemption in purchasing certain goods and services that are covered by VAT.This is on top of the 20 percent discount they are already entitled to under Republic Act 9442, or An Act Amending RA 7277, or the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons and for Other Purposes, Taguiwalo added.The tax exemption law covers restaurants; recreation centers, such as theaters, cinema houses and concert halls; and lodging establishments, such as inns, motorist hotels and dormitories.It also applies to the purchase of medicines and foods for special medical purposes; medical and dental services, including laboratory fees and professional fees of attending doctors; domestic air, sea and land transportation travel; and funeral and burial services.Taguiwalo noted that RA 10754 directs all establishments to place signage on the benefits and privileges of persons with disability within their premises so that the PWD will know what they are entitled to.The law also declares that subsequent purchases made by the PWD on the same day from the same establishment are still subject to VAT-exemption and 20 percent discount, she said.Other salient features of the IRR include reiteration of the right of PWD to social insurance (thru the Government Service Insurance System, Social Security System or Pag-IBIG), educational assistance, special discounts in the purchase of basic necessities and prime commodities and express lanes in all commercial and government establishments.It also includes provision of tax incentives for those caring for and living with persons with disability up to the fourth degree of affinity or consanguinity.Further, RA 10754 also covers certain vitamins, minerals and herbs in the definition of drug or medicine as long as these are in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration’s cutoff as well as food for special medical purposes.It also makes the benefits and privileges available to Filipinos who hold foreign passports but are registered as dual citizens and those who have reacquired their Filipino citizenship thru RA 9225, or the Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003.According to Taguiwalo, double discounts are not allowed by the same law.“This means that if a person with disability is a senior citizen, who is also entitled to a 20 percent discount under his/her valid senior citizen identification card [ID], the PWD shall use either his/her Senior Citizen ID or PWD ID card to avail of the 20 percent discount, she explained.The DSWD chief said the PWD should present proof of entitlement such as ID issued by the Persons with Disability Affairs Office or the City/Municipal Social Welfare Development Office where the PWD reside, passport of the concerned person with apparent disability or an ID issued by the National Council on Disability Affairs for the PWD to enjoy their expanded benefits and privileges as provided by pro-PWD laws.",1
"The Manager of the Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. branch on Jupiter Street in Makati City—gatekeeper of the suspicious bank accounts involved in the $81-million cross-border remittance being investigated by antimoney laundering authorities—is either a negligent banker or a scapegoat, depending on which narrative one reads.Maia Santos-Deguito of the RCBC branch, among the bank’s best performing branches, is being investigated by the RCBC head office for alleged violations of the bank’s money-laundering and terrorist financing-prevention program manual, and for falsification of deposit account opening and other offenses listed by RCBC’s human resources (HR) group in a show-cause memorandum dated March 2.However, Deguito, in a reply to the allegations dated March 7, vehemently denied all the accusations against her.She claimed that all her actions in connection with the questioned transactions were aboveboard, in compliance with applicable rules and procedures and customary practices of the bank, and were known to higher-ups at the head office, including the bank’s president.CEO’s instructionsIn an interview on Monday, lawyer Ferdie Topacio said his client, Deguito, had told him that she received specific instructions directly from RCBC president and CEO Lorenzo Tan to allow the transfer of $81 million into five accounts in her branch.In a press statement on Wednesday, however, Tan branded as “malicious” what he described as “insinuations” that the RCBC top management had approved the multimillion-dollar transfer into the Jupiter branch, which later turned out to be part of an international money-laundering scheme. (See related story on this page.)Five out of six individuals are being probed by the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) in line with an $81-million remittance that the Bangladesh Bank, the South Asian country’s central bank, reported as fraudulent and stolen from its US account. The five individuals kept deposit accounts at the RCBC branch on Jupiter Street.Four of the accounts—those held by Michael Francisco Cruz, Jessie Christopher Lagrosas, Enrico Teodoro Vasquez and Alfred Santos Vergara—were opened in May 2015 and facilitated by Deguito. These accounts had no activity until the $81 million was wired by the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Alleged violationsCiting the bank’s internal investigation, the RCBC memo signed by HR group head Rowena Subido, a copy of which was obtained by the Inquirer, alleged that the branch manager had committed “grave misconduct” and that her actions had resulted in loss of trust and confidence.Subido listed a number of Deguito’s alleged violations, including the following:Opening the bank accounts of the clients (who are now under AMLC investigation) without thorough scrutiny, in violation of the know-your-customer (KYC) rule.Vouching for the remittances from Bangladesh as “valid” and “clean” that in turn led to the lifting of the hold order on the accounts on Feb.

(Meralco), the country’s largest power distributor, announced on Wednesday that there will be a slight increase in the rate for a typical household this December of P0.1011 per kilowatthour after four straight months of reduction totalling P0.35, thereby bringing it to P8.36 per kWh.This translates to an increase of around P20 in the total electricity bill of a household with monthly consumption of 200 kWh. The increase this month is mainly a result of the upward movement in the generation charge.This month’s overall rate, however, is still lower by P0.25 per kWh compared to December 2015’s P8.61 per kWh.This December, there was an increase in the generation charge, which is P0.0915 per kWh higher than last month’s P3.8436 per kWh. At P3.9351 per kWh, the generation charge is P0.1948 per kWh lower compared to December 2015’s P4.1299 per kWh.The increase resulted mainly from a significant weakening of the peso against the US dollar. From a level of P46.580 per US dollar in August, the peso depreciated to P48.405 per US dollar in October, and further to P49.73 per US dollar in November.Partly because of this, the cost of power from the Independent Power Producers (IPPs), whose billings are around 96 percent dollar-denominated, increased by P0.2615 per kWh. The increase resulted from lower dispatch this month with the scheduled maintenance of Santa Rita Module 30 during the whole supply month.The share of the IPPs to Meralco’s total requirements for November was at 36.4 percent.Cost of power sourced from plants under the Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) also increased by P0.2214 per kWh mainly because of higher fuel cost and the weakening of the peso against the US dollar. PSA billings are also affected by peso depreciation as around two-thirds of their costs are dollar-denominated. The PSAs stood at 40.8 percent to power distributor.Overall charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) decreased by P0.3734 per kWh, which partly mitigated the higher charges from the IPPs and PSAs. Spot prices remained low in December because of lower demand and fewer outages compared to those of last month. The share of WESM purchases to Meralco’s total requirements went up from 20.1 to 22.5 percent.In terms of transmission charge, there was also an increase in rates for residential customers by P0.0031 per kWh, mainly because of slight increase in ancillary service charges.Taxes and other charges also increased by a combined amount of around P0.0065 per kWh.Meralco’s distribution, supply and metering charges, meanwhile, have remained unchanged for 17 months, after these registered reductions in July 2015.The distribution company reiterated that it does not earn from the pass-through charges, such as the generation and transmission charges. Payment for the generation charge goes to the power suppliers, while payment for the transmission charge goes to the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).Meanwhile, in preparation for the coming holidays, Meralco encourages its customers to practice energy safety and efficiency this Christmas season, especially with Christmas lights.It gives a few useful tips that consumers can follow when buying or using Christmas lights this December.• When buying Christmas lights, test them first and ensure that all bulbs are functioning, and that the plug is not loose.• LED Christmas lights can save you up to P60 per month compared to incandescent bulbs.• Choose LED Christmas lights not only to save on energy but also to be safe from accidents.• If reusing old Christmas lights, check the bulbs and the plug, and ensure that these are still working properly.• Do not use indoor-type lights and décor for outdoor purposes and, when replacing light bulbs, care should be taken and be sure that the Christmas light set is unplugged.",1
"THE Supreme Court ruling upholding the legality of the K-to-12 program will leave about 10,000 teachers without jobs, a group warned on Tuesday.The group Tanggol Wika said some 10,000 Filipino and Panitikan teachers and professors stand to lose their jobs because of the high court’s decision.The group added that it plans to file an appeal before the tribunal.“Maraming mga bagay na mataas na antas ng diskurso na mas sa college mas matatalakay. Kagaya ng pagtalakay ng mga isyu sa lipunan, pagre-research sa sariling wika. Sampung libong guro ngFilipino at panitikan sa kolehiyo ang posibleng mawalan ng trabaho dahil sa naging desisyon ng korte (There are issues and topics that are better discussed in college. These include issues on society, research on the Filipino language. About 10,000 literature and Filipino teachers will possibly lose their jobs because of the court’s decision),” David Michael San Juan, convenor of Tanggol Wika, said.Education Secretary Leonor Briones was quick to take up the cudgels for the teachers, saying they can teach senior high school students.“The door is always open. They can apply,” Briones said.In a ruling promulgated on Oct. 9, 2018, the high court dismissed the consolidated petitions filed by various schools, teachers, professors and legislators questioning the constitutionality of Republic Act 10533 or the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013.The ruling paved the way for the implementation of CHEd (Commission on Higher Education) Memorandum 20, which removes Filipino and Panitikan as part of the core subjects in college.",1
"Lawyer Larry Gadon filed a graft complaint against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno for alleged non-filing of Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) before the Department of Justice (DoJ) on Friday.Gadon filed the complaint instead of the Office of the Ombudsman, which usually has jurisdiction over high salary grade officials like the Chief Justice.In his three-page complaint, he said Sereno’s missing SALN during her time as a professor at the University of the Philippines violate Section 7 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and Section 8(a) of the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.Both require the disclosure of assets through SALN.Earlier, Rep. Reynaldo Umali of the Second District of Oriental Mindoro recognized that filing a criminal suit against Sereno, an impeachable officer, is a gray area because of the theory of immunity from suit.“Those violations do not matter until or unless she is removed, so we cannot file administrative, criminal or even civil cases because she has immunity, she cannot be removed unless she is impeached,” Umali said.Acknowledging that, Gadon said in his complaint that he is filing the criminal suit anyway to “toll the running of the prescriptive period for the offenses charged.”Jojo Lacanilao, Sereno’s spokesman, said of the complaint, “It’s a laughable move by desperate people.”Legally, in filing the complaint, Gadon wants to stop the countdown of the prescription period.Graft has a prescription period of only 10 years and the last year that Sereno allegedly committed an offense was in 2006, which is over 11 years ago.Meanwhile, Gadon said “Sereno only filed her SALN for the years 1998, 2002 and 2006,” citing the UP College of Law and the Office of the Ombudsman.Both offices told the House Committee on Justice, which is hearing the impeachment complaint against Sereno,that they retrieved only one SALN each.The Ombudsman found only Sereno’s 1998 SALN, while UP found only Sereno’s 2002 SALN.Based on the Chief Justice’s Personal Data Sheets submitted to the committee, Gadon said Sereno worked in UP from 1986 to 2006, or for 20 years.“That means she did not file her SALN 17 times!” he said.Sereno’s camp said the 1986 to 2006 time frame of the Chief Justice’s stint in UP “sounds about right.”Gadon has served as “management and legal consultant” of companies involved in realty development, food manufacturing, information technology, aviation and safety technology and health care, among others.He was admitted to the Bar in 1993.But before he was identified as the man behind the first valid complaint against the country’s Chief Justice, Gadon was widely known as part of the legal team of former president and now Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.",1
"Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has asked the Sandiganbayan to dismiss the plunder charge against her on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove her guilt in the case involving the alleged misuse of P365 million in funds from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO).In a reply to the opposition to her motion for reconsideration dated May 29, 2015, Arroyo, through counsel, asked the antigraft court to reconsider its earlier resolution denying her demurrer to evidence.A demurrer to evidence is a motion to dismiss a case for lack of sufficient evidence to convict the accused.Arroyo said the prosecution failed to refute her valid arguments in her motion for reconsideration dated April 22, 2015. In that motion, she said that the senators who deliberated on the plunder law on June 5, 1989, distinguished between the amount of transaction and the amount that is amassed, as well as the intent to commit a crime for personal benefit.She said that even the author of the plunder law, Sen. Wigberto Tañada, equated “ill-gotten wealth” with “personal benefit.”Arroyo argued that the prosecution in the PCSO case against her merely fixed the wealth that all the accused were supposed to have amassed in conspiracy with each other at the “precise amount of P365,997,915,” supposedly the amount of the transaction.–Cynthia D.

"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump not only ignored questions on immigration from UNIVISION anchor Jorge Ramos; The Donald also had him escorted out of the press conference. Responding to criticism about the incident, Trump said he was merely following the example of President Barack Obama who had a transgender activist heckler, Jennicet Gutiérrez  escorted out of an event at the White House recently. Gutiérrez was protesting the Obama administration’s deportation and treatment of transgender immigrants. Trump posted on his Twitter page: “So why am I being singled out for the very same things  that Democrats — including the president — are guilty of?” Hmmm.",0
"People are generally satisfied with and highly trusting of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.The business sector, taipans and tycoons, and ordinary homeowners are impressed with the Duterte law and order and anti-corruption campaign.Of course, there are equally multitudes that are unhappy with Duterte’s governance style while others, with exaggerated expectations, are impatient for employment, anti-poverty measures, and social justice which have yet to show tangible results at the grassroots.Truth to tell, apart from the President’s repetitive monologues and tirades, there is also a growing climate of fear and trepidation that is causing concern and uncertainty.First, there is little to be gained by the President insulting the listeners with vulgarities and foul language from the seriousness of the subject or occasion which is drug trafficking and the economy.By this time, audience is not only bored with the subject but also with the foul language.Second, President Digong Duterte’s fixation on the war against illegal drugs, however, has had collateral and beneficial results with the substantial reduction in criminality and corruption.Indeed, while President Duterte’s strong message of honesty, incorruptibility, and probity in public office are gaining traction and momentum, unfortunately, the “change” may have been triggered by the fear of being caught rather than the real spiritual “transformation” of a people’s ethos and ethical behavior.At the very least, Pres. Digong Duterte is viewed as a candid, austere, honest, and a real reformer.With the previous Aquino administration, it will be noted, the elite business sector, the Church, and public servants have successfully covered up the shortcomings and blunders of Pres. Benigno Noynoy Aquino by saying with the wave of the hand that “Noynoy was at least honest” or whatever that word means or conjures as there are different shades or nuances of “honesty.”Third, while it is truly refreshing to witness sincere attempts to search for peace, eradicate endemic poverty, drug addiction, and insurgency, and reaching out to other nations, this administration has too many irons in the fire, so to speak, and too many unnecessary and mundane conflicts that this administration has neither the resources nor expertise to tackle them all.When all is said and done, Pres. Rodrigo Roa Duterte must aspire for greatness, be a patriarch and statesman rather than just a passing President who will be remembered for his foul mouth and extrajudicial killings.You be the judge.",1
"The White House announced today that President and Mrs. Obama have decided to hire Forest Whitaker to be the head butler for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.Whitaker is the actor who played the role of real-life butler Eugene Allen who served eight American presidents in the Hollywood film by Lee Daniels.The White House announcement came shortly after the nominations for the 2014 Golden Globes were announced by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). Many were shocked that Whitaker was not nominated for Best Actor. In fact, the Lee Daniels’ film did not receive a single nomination. Earlier, however, Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey and the ensemble cast of The Butler were nominated by the Screen Actors’ Guild (SAG) for its 2014 awards.The Adobo Chronicles learned that Michelle Obama was so distressed by the Golden Globes’ snub of Whitaker that she pressured the president to offer the all-important White House job to the actor as a way of getting back at the HFPA.Whitaker gladly accepted the offer, saying that he hopes to serve under another eight U.S. presidents. The Obamas reportedly agreed to have Whitaker continue to make films as long as his film schedule doesn’t conflict with state banquets at The White House.",0
"Marching to muted drums, uniformed commandos bore the numbered coffins of their comrades killed in a massacre that left dozens of grieving families, an angry public, policemen weeping and a seemingly defensive President.On the coffins’ arrival on Thursday at Villamor Air Base after a flight from Cotabato City, a woman stood before a flag-draped casket, immobilized by grief. Another woman hugged another coffin so tightly she refused to let it go.One woman collapsed to the ground, prompting medical personnel to rush to her aid.More than 300 pallbearers and three C-130 military cargo planes were needed to bring the dead warriors from Cotabato to Villamor Air Base for a ceremony hailing their readiness to give up their lives for the country.The killing of 44 Special Action Force (SAF) men in the fighting in Maguindanao province on Sunday represented the worst case of loss of life in the country’s police force—or its military—in recent memory.Their deaths overshadowed the apparently successful mission of taking down Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias “Marwan,” an expert bomb maker behind the deadly bombings in the Philippines and abroad.The United States had offered a $6-million bounty for Marwan’s capture.Mr. Aquino was nowhere near Villamor Air Base when the coffins were flown in. He was attending the opening of a Mitsubishi car plant in Laguna province.March in somber blueEarly Thursday at the Cotabato City airport, hundreds of policemen matched their blue uniforms with white gloves to serve as pallbearers.The fallen commandos were in 42 metal caskets covered in the red, blue and white colors of the Philippine flag.From being among the best fighters in the country, the commandos had been reduced simply to a number and a name when they were returned to their families yesterday.Two other SAF troopers were buried earlier in accordance with their Muslim tradition.The ceremony in Cotabato before the flight to Manila started at 7 a.m. with a prayer and blessing by a priest, followed by the playing of taps.‘Face the heroes’A commander then ordered 336 policemen to walk toward the coffins, each coffin with eight pallbearers.“Harap sa mga bayani! (Face the heroes!)” came the next order. Then the pallbearers lifted the coffins and marched slowly to the three aircraft as a band played a somber hymn.It took nearly 30 minutes to finish the grim task of loading the caskets to the aircraft. The C-130 planes took off within 15 minutes of each other.The 44 commandos were killed in a deadly clash with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF).Not an ordinary dayOn the caskets’ arrival at Villamor Air Base, police personnel, both men and women, cried as they reached out to touch the coffins.The farewell ceremony turned into an outpouring of grief from those present, including generals, ordinary servicemen, and incumbent and former officials.“This is in recognition of their heroism and a sign of mourning. This is not an ordinary day,” said acting police spokesperson, Chief Supt. Generoso Cerbo Jr.Among the families who gathered at the grandstand was a 5-year-old boy who only found out his father was dead the moment he was led to the casket of PO2 Olivet Viernes.Viernes’ wife Virgie brought her two children, ages 5 and 11, with her when she left Tuguegarao City on Monday after confirming her husband was dead.She simply told her boy Carlo that they were going to meet his father in Manila.“He kept on asking, ‘Why do we have to meet him? When will he come home to us?’” said Virgie, who said her husband was scheduled to come home in March for a visit.All-out warHer husband’s cell phone had apparently been taken as a man would answer it when the family would call, she said.Virgie said she wanted an “all-out war.” “They should pay for what they have done,” she said.SAF troopers carried the caskets in a slow procession toward the grandstand while honor guards stood at attention and a band played a dirge. Policemen barricading the media were seen wiping tears.Government officials stood meters away. They included Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, Philippine National Police Director General Leonardo Espina, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Gregorio Catapang Jr., SAF officer in charge Chief Supt. Noli Taliño, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, Transportation Secretary Emilio Abaya and presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda wearing black armbands.The President’s absence was glaring.At the grandstand were Vice President Jejomar Binay, his daughter Sen. Nancy Binay, former president Fidel Ramos, former first lady now Leyte Rep. Imelda Marcos and her son, Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.‘This is slaughter’There, too, were former interior undersecretary Rico Puno, the President’s uncle Peping Cojuangco and his wife Tingting.Tingting Cojuangco said she had seen the bodies in the cornfield in Mamasapano and as they were brought to the morgue.“I saw the bodies in the cornfield, in the creek. There were shots in the head not too much in the body. Some had no uniform, only underwear. Did he (President Aquino) see that?” Cojuangco said.“This is slaughter,” she said.She said the MILF should answer why they harbored internationally wanted terrorists in their area.Loud cries“It was just appropriate that they are received by their colleagues in SAF,” Cerbo told reporters as the coffins were flown in.When the families of the slain policemen were allowed to get near the coffins, loud cries filled the air. Even before the doors of the C-130 were opened, wails pierced the solemnity of the rites.The remains were transported in hearses from Villamor Air Base to funeral homes before they were brought to Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City, where necrological services were to be held.

"Once known for its vibrant salt industry, Occidental Mindoro and its salt farmers are getting an ounce of help and a little push from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) through innovative technologies in a bid to improve production and harvest.“At the height of its production in 1990, it boasted of producing and supplying about 60,000 MT (metric tons) of the 338,000 MT or 18 percent of the country’s annual salt requirement,” DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña said as he recalled the glory days of salt production in Occidental Mindoro.Occidental Mindoro is surrounded by saltwater, making it one of the biggest salt-producing provinces in the country. However, due to climate change, the local salt industry in the province was greatly affected.“Today, while Occidental Mindoro still supplies salt in neighboring provinces in Southern Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, only 12 percent national salt requirement… comes from the province,” the DOST Region 4-B said.Fortunately, the DOST-MIMAROPA (Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan) has started to revolutionize the salt industry with the adoption of the prototype of an improved salt production technology developed by DOST.“The new technology lowers the cost of production while developing a salt crystallization process that can withstand rainy season. Occidental Mindoro will be able to harvest more salt by ensuring production year-round or even during the off-season, as well as develop by-products from it such as gypsum and bitterns, which is seen to generate more income for both salt farmers and salt producers in the province,” the DOST-MIMAROPA said.",1
" What is “atcha?” That’s the Ybanag term for filter, which is how local gamblers called a scheme used by “jueteng” operators to ride on the rising popularity of the government’s Small Town Lottery (STL) in Cagayan province.Residents here claimed that STL personnel announce two separate sets of winning number combinations each day.“The [winning number combinations] are disclosed almost the same time as those of STL, presumably to make people think that these are one and the same.The purpose is to hide behind STL,” said a vegetable vendor at the Mall of the Valley, this city’s biggest public market.Supt.

"The Department of Agrarian Reform-Cordillera released a total of 1,819 Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) covering an area of 937 hectares in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) to 1,652 Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs) during a turn-over ceremony here last Thursday.There were 387 ARBs from Mountain Province who received their individual CLOAs; 379 from Kalinga; 376 from Ifugao; 351 from Ifugao; 120 from Apayao; and 39 from Abra.DAR Undersecretary for Field Operations Karlo Bello, together with Regional Director Marjorie Ayson and other officials of the department, were present for the occasion which many ARBs have been waiting to happen for over 20 years.Among those who received a CLOA for her 2.2-hectare rice land was 58-year-old Rosalina Barwelo of Alfonso Lista, Ifugao who waited for over ten years to hold a document that says she owns the land she is tilling to plant rice. Barwelo was all smiles after the title was handed to her.Bello said President Duterte issued a clear policy instruction to give the individual titles or CLOAs to the ARBs for the department to perform its mandate with immediacy.“President Duterte wants individual titling of lands for our beneficiaries, not the collective CLOAs,” Bello said.He added that the President has also mandated the DAR to boost the provision of support services to the ARBs to develop the lands awarded to them.Bello was recently designated by Malacañang as acting OIC Secretary of the DAR until the return of OIC Secretary Rosalina Bistoyong from an official trip abroad.The official said the activity is very important because it formalizes the recognition of the legitimacy of the ownership of the farmers over the land they till.",1
"Thousands of protesters marched through Makati City’s business district on Wednesday, demanding that Vice President Jejomar Binay drop his plan to run for President next year as Sen. Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III vowed to break up the Binay political dynasty.Led by entertainers Jim Paredes, Leah Navarro and Cynthia Patag, the #StopBinay protest was joined by people from various sectors of the Makati community, exceeding the 200 that the organizers said they had expected.“We only expected about 200 people to show up but we were shocked that those people also brought other people with them,” Paredes told reporters.The march started from Freedom Park at Ayala Avenue and Gil Puyat Avenue and made its way to the side streets and underpasses of Ayala and ended at the Ninoy Aquino monument at Paseo de Roxas.“We have finally walked our talk,” Paredes said, addressing the protesters who demanded an end to the rule of politicians with questionable integrity.“The Vice President does not deserve to be President. Today, we declare that we must #StopBinay,” the organizers said in a statement.Paredes said Binay owed the people a lot of explanation for the charges of corruption against him in the Senate and the Office of the Ombudsman.A Senate blue ribbon subcommittee is investigating allegations of corruption against Binay during his three terms as mayor of Makati.Binay is also facing plunder and graft charges in the Office of the Ombudsman in connection with the construction of Makati City Hall Building II, allegedly overpriced at P2.3 billion.“He has refused to show up in Senate hearings. I think as a possible presidential candidate, he should at least answer the charges against him,” Paredes said.Binay’s invariable answer that the charges are politically motivated is not enough, Paredes said.“That is a lame answer. So if the government is timid in treating him, it’s time the people spoke up,” he said.Charges against BinaysParedes said the online movement was inspired by the Senate inquiry into the alleged overpricing of the building and the other charges against the members of Binay’s family, including the alleged cornering of contracts such as for the supply of birthday cakes for the city’s senior residents, catering and maintenance services at Makati City Hall.“It took a while for us to realize that we should go beyond posting memes and opinions on Facebook,” Paredes said, explaining why the movement held a protest rally only on Wednesday.“When the Binays talk, it’s as if they were already the winners. We want them to know that there are many people who will not vote for them,” Paredes said.Binay’s son, Jejomar Erwin “Junjun” Binay, is mayor of Makati. His daughter, Mar-len Abigail Binay-Campos holds the seat of Makati’s second district in the House of Representatives. Another daughter, Maria Lourdes Nancy Sombillo Binay, was unknown but was elected to the Senate in 2013.In their statement, the organizers of #StopBinay expressed confidence that with proper information, the people will be able to choose the right leaders and reject those who will lead the country backward.End of dynasties?If a Senate substitute bill against political dynasties becomes law before next year’s elections, the Binays will be facing tough choices.Pimentel, chair of the Senate committee on electoral reforms, said his “stricter” substitute bill would allow only one member of a family up to the second civil degree to hold elective office if a national office is concerned.If it is approved in its current form before the next elections, Vice President Binay may not be able to run for President since Senator Binay’s term would not end until 2019, Pimentel said.For the Vice President to pursue his presidential ambition, Senator Binay would have to resign, he said.Mayor Binay would also be unable to run for reelection, Pimentel said.The bill would also prohibit siblings from concurrently serving in the Senate, he said.House versionIn the House, however, the antipolitical dynasty bill could institutionalize the dominance of political clans.Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. on Wednesday said he agreed with some House members whose view was to allow other members of political families to branch out and run for elective posts in “other political jurisdictions.”Belmonte said the maximum of two positions per family proposed under the antipolitical dynasty bill would apply only to the family’s province, with other members of the family allowed to run in another city or province.But House members have yet to decide whether to allow other family members to run in provinces, cities, towns and barangays (villages), he said.“I agreed because a political dynasty is largely localized and not on a national scale. A dynasty in Quezon City has nothing to do with a dynasty in Taguig or Makati,” Belmonte said.–With reports from Leila B. Salaverria and Gil C.

"THEY’RE out to copy the cat.The taste of the world’s most expensive coffee may soon be replicated by Filipino scientists.The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) is embarking on a research that aims to find out just how the civet produces the well-loved and in-demand coffee beans.Science Secretary Mario Montejo told the Inquirer he had already instructed Director Mario Capanzana of the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) to form a group of researchers that would look into the civet’s digestive system and the biological processes it undergoes to make the coffee beans it excretes flavorful.Montejo got the idea of studying the civet’s digestive processes during his visit last week to South Cotabato province as part of his department’s Science Nation Tour.“As far as we know, the study is a pioneering effort in the world,” he said.World’s most expensiveThe civet lives in tropical forests and thrives on berries and coffee beans. The coffee beans that are excreted by the civet are collected by farmers and processed to become the world’s most expensive coffee.In the Philippines, South Cotabato is gaining ground in the coffee industry because its Mt. Matutum is home to a number of coffee plantations with civets.Currently, Montejo said, regular coffee beans retail for P600 per 100 kilograms. For the same quantity, the civet coffee sells for P8,000.He said that by conducting the research and eventually applying it to the industry, coffee farmers will benefit the most because they would be able to sell their beans for at least P2,000.To be protectedMontejo pointed out, however, that the result of the study would at most come up with an “approximate” of the civet’s digestive process.“We can’t duplicate nature, but it will add a premium value to our coffee,” he said.He also said that with the study, the civet population would be protected since keeping them in an “almost untouched state” was important in replicating their biological process.Montejo said that they were still drawing up the timeline when the study could be completed and eventually applied to the industry through the FNRI.The FNRI, an attached agency of the DOST, is mandated to provide knowledge and technologies in food and nutrition, as well as science and technology services, to stakeholders.",1
"THE Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) has stepped up its information campaign on federalism by deploying teams to various regions to educate the people about the proposed shift to federalism.DILG Secretary Ismael Sueno said the information campaign does not only cover local government officials but the “people on the ground.”He said educating the people on what federalism is all about is the key to getting public consensus on the proposed shift to a federal form of government.“At present there are four groups going around the country giving talks in schools, academe and civilians, explaining what federalism is all about. So that if there will be a voting, whether they accept it or not, they will understand what the federal system is,” Sueno said in his speech during the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991.Sueno and over 300 local officials gathered in Pasay City last week to mark the 25-year “journey” of the Local Government Code, decentralization and devolution.The DILG chief said he is pleased with the support shown by local chief executives to the proposed move to federalism.He said one of the benefits that local government units (LGUs) will reap from a federal form of government is fiscal autonomy.“They are really supportive sa federal system of government kasi mas malaki na ang authority nila dahil talagang autonomous na sila (because they will have expanded authority and they will be autonomous). At saka sa revenues malaki na ang pera na maiiwan sa kanila at saka may kumpetisyon na sa bawat isa sa kanila tulad sa US na may competition between and among states to attract investors. Ganun din sa China, ang mga provinces patuloy na lumalaki (They will have bigger funds and they can compete with other LGUs just like in the US where there is competition between states to attract investors. It’s also like that in China),” Sueno said.",1
"(Last of a series)A doctor, a businessman and an award-winning poet were brutally killed before they turned 30 during the dark years of Ferdinand Marcos’ martial law regime.Remberto “Bobby” dela Paz, Artemio “Jun” Celestial Jr. and Emmanuel “Eman” Lacaba were among the best and the brightest who could have been the country’s future leaders.Theirs are among the 253 names etched on the black granite Wall of Remembrance of Bantayog ng mga Bayani Foundation in Quezon City—so honored for being the country’s modern-day martyrs and heroes.They gave up their lives fighting the Marcos dictatorship.Bobby was a medical doctor who graduated from the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Medicine. But he chose not to work abroad. Instead, he set up his practice among the poor people in Samar province.Bobby was working in his clinic in Catbalogan City when he was shot by a lone gunman in April 1982.Body on a riverJun was a true-blue Atenean and was the secretary general of the student council. After working at the National Grains Authority, he put up a tailoring business with a friend.In February 1975, Jun wrote a letter to Marcos demanding that the latter free all political prisoners.Three days later, his body was found floating in the Montalban River near Wawa Dam. His skull was broken and his body was mangled.Mass graveEman was an honor student from grade school to high school and won a full scholarship at Ateneo de Manila University. He was an award-winning poet, a UP lecturer, a fictionist, an essayist, a playwright and a magazine illustrator, among his many talents.How Eman died is told in the book, “Six Young Filipino Martyrs.” His killer, as ordered by a sergeant of the Philippine Constabulary (now the Philippine National Police), “put a gun in Eman’s mouth and pulled the trigger, sending the bullet crashing through the back of his skull. As he fell, a second bullet was fired into his chest.”The killer and other soldiers then tied a rope around Eman’s body and dragged it like a cow along a craggy road in Balaag, Tucaan, in the Davao area and buried it in a shallow mass grave.Tribute from CorySpeaking in November 1989 before the mothers, wives and relatives of the heroes honored at Bantayog ng mga Bayani, then President Corazon Aquino said: “Many of those whose names are carved on the wall of this monument were, once upon a time, considered by the State as insurgents—its enemies, who were menaces to society.“This was why many of them were arrested, kidnapped, tortured, salvaged or killed in action by the martial law forces.“In truth, they were freedom fighters who fought and died on the side of the people. No other distinction is needed. ”She added: “By their death, they taught us how to live—with full commitment to the cause, with the courage of our convictions, with the strength to persevere and with the firm belief that no effort ever really goes to waste, no loss is irretrievable. ”Dr. Bobby dela PazBobby did his required six-month rural medical work in Samar where he saw the impact of Marcos’ one-man rule on the lives of the ordinary people.In the book “Six Young Filipino Martyrs,” his wife, Sylvia, also a doctor who also chose to work in Samar, gave examples of what the couple saw.“When we got to Samar,” she said, “we saw the stark reality of people living on one meal a day, composed of seashells and root crops; farmers deprived of their lands to make way for multinational interests on mines; fishermen deprived of the chance to catch fish because of multinational crawlers.”After Bobby became a full-fledged doctor, he had the opportunity to go to Japan to take up bio-medical engineering. But he opted to set up medical practice with his wife as community doctors in Gandara, Samar.Well-loved doctorTheir clinic was open to everyone, especially the poor. Bobby went to far-flung areas to attend to the sick, taught first-aid treatment, proper hygiene and nutrition to the barrio folk.This invited suspicion that he was a sympathizer or a member of the New People’s Army (NPA).With threats on the couple’s safety becoming more and more apparent, friends urged them to leave, but they only moved to Catbalogan City to continue their practice.Bobby had said: “I am a doctor and the only thing I should fear is not being a good one.”And he was a well-loved doctor.When news spread that he was shot, people from all walks of life rushed to the hospital where was taken. At least 200 people immediately gathered and offered their blood and money to save his life.Residents of Gandara came to keep vigil and the folks of Zumarraga, where Bobby first served, were said to have cursed the waters that would not allow them to cross to Catbalogan.They, too, wanted to give their doctor their blood.Bobby’s death was a big blow to the cause of Philippine rural medicine—he was the first doctor to practice in the rural areas to be brutally gunned down.Artemio Celestial Jr.Jun became active with the Student Catholic Action (SCA) and joined student fora and marches across the Ateneo campus, calling on other students to become involved.He became the student council’s secretary general in November 1971 after leading council officers were expelled for their activism.According to the biography notes by the Bantayog Foundation, Jun himself was expelled along with other activists when martial law was declared, their pictures posted in the school’s guardhouses.Jun and his younger brother Joel, also an activist, escaped when soldiers raided a home in Project 4 in Quezon City.Jun was a full-blooded Atenean, according to a list of dead Ateneans posted by Ateneo’s Alumni Office. He finished grade school in 1965, high school in 1969 and graduated with an AB Economics degree in 1973.Honors from AteneoIn November 2005, Ateneo honored Jun with three other Ateneans—Ferdinand Arceo, William Begg and Lazaro “Lazzie” Silvar Jr.—as Ateneo’s very own heroes for joining the movement against the dictator Marcos and dying at the hands of state forces.Jun was once arrested and kept in prison for a few days when he was mistaken for his brother Joel, who had joined the underground. Upon release, Jun continued to help the underground movement with financial and logistical support.Joel himself was arrested in 1973 and detained in Fort Bonifacio, where many of Jun’s friends were also imprisoned.In February 1975, three days after he handed a letter urging Marcos to free political prisoners to a “person of authority” who then gave it to a soldier, his mangled body was found floating in the Montalban River.Emmanuel LacabaEman was the editor of their high school paper and later received an American Field Service (AFS) scholarship. He completed his fourth year at Robert Millikan High School in Long Beach, California, where his poem, “Golden Gate Bridge,” won the overall poetry first prize.Upon graduation, the bemedaled Eman had his pick of scholarships from UP, De La Salle University and Ateneo. He chose a scholarship at Ateneo, where he graduated in 1970.Eman was arrested and detained for his participation in a strike. Because of this, he lost his job at UP where he was teaching Rizal’s life and works.Shy poet to a warriorIn 1974, Eman decided to join the NPA in South Cotabato province. He took up the name Popoy Dakuykoy, an allusion to a comic book character whose name he had once used for a character in an epic poem he had written in the 1960s.His radicalization from a scholar and “a shy young poet forever writing last poem after last poem” to “a people’s warrior” can be discerned from the various poems he had written.His earlier poems touched on his search for meaning and his efforts to find himself. From Mindanao, he wrote a friend: “I think I belong here. I feel no sadness anymore; I only remember . . . the world we left behind, whose wiles of momentary farce and luxurious living we have to continue to struggle against.”True home foundTwo months before he died, his poem states: “The road less traveled by we’ve taken—And that has made the difference. . . Here among workers and peasants our lost generation has found its true, its only home.”Eman had been with the NPA two years when he met his death in March 1976",1
"President Duterte partied with Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada during the former President’s 80th birthday bash at The Manila Hotel on Wednesday night.Mr. Duterte joined other politicians, including former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo—who now holds the seat of the second district of Pampanga province in the House of Representatives—former first lady Imelda Marcos and her son, former Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., in wishing the politically enduring Estrada well.Plunder chargesPhotos released by Malacañang showed Mr. Duterte and Estrada seated beside each other. They shared light moments, according to the Palace.The mayor’s son, former Sen. Jinggoy Estrada, on furlough from detention, also welcomed Mr. Duterte and shook his hand.Jinggoy is detained on graft and plunder charges that stemmed from alleged misuse of his allocation from the Priority Development Assistance Fund, a pork barrel that the Supreme Court had struck down as unconstitutional.Also spotted at the party was former Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who, like Jinggoy, is facing graft and plunder charges in connection with the pork barrel scam, allegedly masterminded by businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles.Enrile is out on bail.Napoles, who is also facing plunder charges, is serving a life sentence for illegal detention involving her nephew, pork barrel whistle-blower Benhur Luy.Estrada’s other guests included former Vice President Jejomar Binay—who is accused of graft and corruption in the Office of the Ombudsman for alleged overpriced contracts during his long term as mayor of Makati City—former Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr. and Sen. Manny Pacquiao.Fight against corruptionA Palace statement said Mr. Duterte, aside from greeting Estrada, talked about his plans for the country, including eliminating graft and corruption, and the scourge of illegal drugs.Mr. Duterte said he would let his economic managers improve the country’s economy, adding that his Cabinet included brilliant, clean and honest men.He spoke as well about this administration’s peace talks with communist rebels, and warned of the threat posed by Islamic extremists.",1
"Tagbilaran City–A multi-sectoral group is opposing the plan to put up a coal-fired power plant in Bohol.Emilia M. Roslinda, executive director of Process-Bohol and president of the Bohol Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (BANGON) expressed the opposition in a manifesto the group sent last week to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. The manifesto was tackled during the presiding officer’s time by Acting Vice Governor Vinzencio B. Arcamo during the board’s regular session Friday.The manifesto was also signed by citizens groups, faith-based organizations and environmental advocates in the province.The signatories said coal as a fuel is dirty, costly and deadly.Arcamo referred the manifesto to a joint committee composed of environment as the lead committee and the public utilities, peace and order and the committee on public safety and health.The committee is expected to meet next week and hear the views of resource persons on the matter.Arcamo said he hopes to have the committee report as soon as possible so that the board could present its recommendations to governor.Aside from BANGON, the manifesto was signed by the Bol-anon United Sectors Working for the Advancement of Community Concerns (BUSWACC), Bohol Initiators for Sustainable Agriculture and Development (BISAD), and the Integrated Midwives Association of the Philippines (IMAP).Bonifacio Quirog Jr., board secretary, also signed as a civil servant and an environmental advocate.",1
"win or lose.Flores is one of nine finalists who could be the grand winner in the mega-reality show being held in Singapore. Four Filipino acts and five others from Singapore, Japan, Thailand, China and Mongolia are competing for the title ‘Best Talent in Asia.’“Let bygones be bygones,” Aquino said, referring to the incident in 2010 when she and fellow ‘Pilipinas Got Talent” judge Ai-Ai de las Alas, voted out Flores, then a teenager contestant in the show, because they thought the classical singer should be singing songs that the audience and her peers could relate to, like songs that Charice would sing.Aquino left for Singapore early Monday morning and is desperately seeking to meet with Flores before Thursday’s announcement of the grand winner of the talent show. She is also reportedly trying to schedule an interview with internationally-acclaimed composer and producer David Foster who is head over heels for the talented Flores.

"The Seattle Seahawks, one of U.S. National Football League teams favored to advance into this season’s Super Bowl, chalked up their 10th win last Sunday as it defeated the Minnesota Vikings. But that was not the headline.Seahawks player Doug Baldwin, who is part Filipino, carried the Philippine flag as his team entered the football stadium. By doing so, the Seahawks all but declared war on behalf of the typhoon-ravaged country. The four-color Philippine flag has a red stripe and a blue stripe. During peace time, the flag is always carried or displayed with the blue stripe on top. The red stripe on top signals that the country has declared or is at war. Baldwin carried the flag with the red stripe on top.The Seahawks explained that the Philippines is “fighting the devastation of Haiyan which has been worse than many war-torn regions of the world.” Many thought the explanation was lame and undiplomatic.To make amends, the team signed a pledge that it will send all its players to the Philippines to fight alongside that country’s army should it be involved in any military war now or in the future. But the ever-forgiving Filipinos suggested instead that the Seahawks send its entire team to Tacloban City to help with relief and reconstruction efforts immediately after the Super Bowl. That is, assuming the team will make it to the Super Bowl.",0
"Homicide investigators are looking into the “love angle” in Friday night’s fatal shooting of a university professor who doubles up as a local radio broadcaster in Masingal town, this province.Senior Superintendent Rey de Peralta, Police Provincial Office (PPO) director, revealed the direction of the investigation into the murder of Dr. Mario Cantaoi, 52, a professor at the University of Northern Philippines in this city.While saying that Cantaoi’s killing seemed to have been more of a “love or personal motive” than a media-related killing, De Peralta also clarified some facts of the case.He said Cantaoi was no longer an active broadcaster for Catholic-owned Radio DZNS.The provincial director (PD) also corrected earlier reports that the professor was slain at his beach resort in Barangay San Ramon, Magsingal, and said that Cantaoi was fatally shot on his way home after having a drinking spree with friends at the Verano beerhouse.Chief Inspector William Nerona, PPO spokesman, said Cantaoi was still alive when he left the beerhouse and expressed confidence that a closed-circuit television (CCTV) installed at the establishment would reveal possible suspects.As to the love angle as a motive, Nerona said: “When the victim and his companions were drinking inside a restaurant at the beach resort, it appeared that he (victim) had a special attention for one of the waitresses there. So when he went home alone, he was waylaid along the way.” (With a report from Freddie G. Lazaro)",1

"The UN Security Council will vote on a US-drafted resolution ramping up sanctions on North Korea by restricting oil supplies vital for Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear programs.The United States has been in negotiations with China, Pyongyang’s ally, on slapping new sanctions in response to the November 28 test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).The vote is scheduled for 1:00 pm (1800 GMT), diplomats said.Building on previous sanctions resolutions, the new draft tightens restrictions on crude and refined oil deliveries to North Korea, most of which are supplied by China.The measure would ban the supply of nearly 90 percent of refined oil products to North Korea and order the repatriation of all North Korean nationals working abroad within 12 months, according to the text obtained by AFP.US President Donald Trump asked Chinese President Xi Jinping last month to cut off oil to North Korea, a move that would deal a crippling blow to its desperately struggling economy.Tens of thousands of North Koreans have been sent to Russia and China to earn hard currency for Pyongyang, working in what UN rights officials have described as “slave-like conditions.”The draft resolution would cap crude oil supplies to four million barrels per year and require countries to seek UN permission to ship crude to North Korea.Deliveries of refined petroleum products including diesel and kerosene would be capped at 500,000 barrels for next year, according to the measure that would order all countries to report their shipments to the United Nations.",1

He needed a little pause from all his hard work and lack of sleep.

"The war of words between the defense department and communist rebels sank to a new low Saturday with both sides accusing each other of financial impropriety.On one side, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana raised doubt that so-called revolutionary taxes being collected by rebels were being spent on the poor, as rebels claimed.On the other side, leaders of National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) accused Lorenzana of lacking transparency in the use of billions of pesos of defense funds.In a statement, Lorenzana questioned claims made by Fidel Agcaoili, NDFP chief peace negotiator, that revolutionary tax being collected by rebels were being used for projects for the poor.“Where does the money you forcibly collect really go?” said Lorenzana, addressing himself to NDFP.“What’s your proof that the people, particularly the poor, benefit?” he said.“What’s clear is that the ‘revolutionary tax’ they collect is spent for the luxury of a few (in the communist organization),” Lorenzana added.Explain DND spendingAgcaoili, in a statement, said Lorenzana should be the one to explain how Department of National Defense (DND) funds were being spent.“Without confirming his allegation, what is Lorenzana complaining about? All taxes collected by the revolutionary government go toward providing services to the people and the communities,” Agcaoili said.“What about the P137.2-billion 2017 budget of the DND, where did the monies go?” said Agcaoili.“To line the pockets of the generals, military commanders and senior officials of the DND and Armed Forces of the Philippines,” he said.In a speech before businessmen in Davao City on Friday, Lorenzana said businessmen and groups should reject rebel demands to pay taxes because they “rely on extortion to survive.”“If the sources of their funds run dry, their activity will also decrease and eventually end their movement,” Lorenzana said.Peace spoilersLorenzana said the communist movement, not he, was the one spoiling the peace process by “playing its old game of accusing the government of the very crimes that its members are committing.”The defense chief said it was the rebellion that was keeping the countryside from taking off.The rebels, said Lorenzana, “have now stepped up their rhetoric because their ploy to continue talking while fighting was finally terminated by the President.”Agcaoili, in the NDFP statement, said despite substantial funding, the DND failed to protect Philippine territory in the West Philippine Sea from aggression by China.Peace talks between the government and NDFP were scrapped by Mr. Duterte in July after New People’s Army rebels raided a convoy of presidential guards in the borders of Davao City, Bukidnon and North Cotabato.Seven members of the Presidential Security Group were wounded in the attack.",1

"BIÑAN CITY—With the Philippine National Police demoted from the lead role in President Duterte’s war on drugs, PNP Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, folded “Oplan Tokhang” and “Project Double Barrel” on Thursday.Oplan Tokhang is the police door-to-door campaign to convince drug users to surrender for rehabilitation.Project Double Barrel is the intensified campaign against the narcotics trade, characterized by police sweeps of the slums in which the PNP says officers have killed more than 3,800 suspects who resisted arrest since Mr. Duterte launched the campaign after taking office in June last year.More than 2,000 others have been killed by unknown assailants, who human rights groups believe are hired guns working for the police or are policemen themselves working for rewards promised by their superiors.Public anger over the killings, especially of minors, pulled down Mr. Duterte’s approval and trust ratings in opinion polls, forcing him to demote the PNP from the lead in his antinarcotics program.Fewer deathsSpeaking to reporters in Malacañang on Thursday, Mr. Duterte said he decided to make the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) the lead agency in the fight against illegal drugs because few had been killed in its operations.“This is better or betterer, do you say,” Mr. Duterte said. “There were no deaths, so there would be no encounter. So better for you bleeding hearts and the media. I hope I will satisfy you.”But Dela Rosa, who unabashedly cried in the Senate over criticism of the brutality of the campaign, said on Thursday that he was “sad” aboutMr. Duterte’s decision to take away the lead role in the war on drugs from the PNP and give it to the PDEA.“We poured all our energy into this campaign but it did not totally succeed,” the PNP chief told reporters in Biñan City, where he attended the launching of a rehabilitation program for drug users.Dela Rosa said he doubted the PDEA’s capability to carry out the war on drugs with its 1,700 agents, compared with the PNP force of more than 185,000. “I don’t know their tack on the (drug) problem,” he said.Drug units dissolvedHe said the only ones happy about the President’s decision were the drug lords and drug pushers, who were probably saying “back to business, back to business.”“Now that we are pulling back, I don’t know if the crime rates would rise again,” he added.Besides Oplan Tokhang and Project Double Barrel, the PNP also dissolved its drug enforcement units, from regional offices down to police stations throughout the country.Director Camilo Cascolan, head of the PNP Directorate for Operations, said the force would now focus on reducing street crimes.Among the street crimes to be tackled by the PNP are killings by motorcycle-riding gunmen, which Cascolan described as the crime “now destroying the reputation and credibility of the PNP.”Human rights campaigners say the drive-by shootings are the work of hired guns working for the PNP in the war on drugs or are policemen themselves out to collect rewards that come with the campaign.The PNP denies having a hand in those mostly nighttime attacks, saying they are carried out by drug gangs fighting over turf.Chief Supt. Dionardo Carlos, spokesperson for the PNP, told a news conference on Thursday that the police campaign that lasted more than a year would bear out the PNP.He said the PNP carried out 80,000 operations against illegal drugs throughout the country in running the campaign.The campaign, he said, “reached out to the lives of those affected by the drug menace—1.3 million” people.He said the PNP assessment was that the police campaign was 95 percent “to provide [an] opportunity [for rehabilitation] for the people who are affected by drugs.”The other 5 percent, or 109,000 drug offenders, were arrested alive, he said.Carlos said all this was “almost 99.9908 percent of the campaign.”Malacañang said that by designating the PDEA as lead agency in the war on drugs, the government was just shifting the focus of the campaign against narcotics.“What happened was the street distribution networks of the drug lords havebeen degraded,” presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said, referring to the police campaign.“So we now target higher echelons of the syndicates as well as their protectors in the government,” he said.",1
"President Benigno Aquino III used his last State of the Nation Address (Sona) not just to trumpet the achievements of his administration; he also unleashed criticism obviously directed against Vice President Jejomar Binay and lavished praise on Binay’s perceived rival, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas.Mr. Aquino expressed his gratitude to his Cabinet officials, but his praise for Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, believed by many to be his chosen successor, stood out. He called Roxas a man he and the country can trust to choose the nation over himself.While hitting Roxas’ critics for trying to pull him down despite his achievements, Aquino lauded Roxas for his dedication to public service. “Mar, pinatutunayan mo: You can’t put a good man down,” President Aquino said.He mentioned more Cabinet officials, even his personal assistant and stylist, for helping him in his administration. But Mr. Aquino did not include in his thank you list his housing czar and OFW affairs head, who since resigning from the Cabinet assumed his role as leader of the opposition.READ: 2-hour Sona on Aquino gains strewn with swipes at BinayAquino minced no words in blasting Binay for the latter’s criticisms against the current administration, his platform of governance, and even Binay’s off-handed push for a “one-to-sawa” (unlimited) term extension for elective officials.‘One to sawa‘“Itong term na ito ’di talaga ako naniniwala d’yan,” Binay said before local officials of Bacolod city. “Kailangan one to sawa ’yan, hangga’t gusto ng tao. Kaya kung meron amendments sa Constitution, ipapaalis ko yung term limitation. Hangga’t maaari, iboto nang iboto.” (Binay later clarified that he merely wanted to extend the term limits of local officials).In his Sona, Mr. Aquino denounced political families especially those tainted with corruption. He said he also turned down propositions to amend the charter to extend his term in office.“Pero napapaisip po ako: May mali rin sa pagbibigay ng pagkakataong habambuhay na magpakasasa sa kapangyarihan ang isang tiwaling pamilya o indibiduwal. Ganyang kaisipan din ang dahilan kung bakit, noong may nagmungkahing manatili pa ako sa puwesto—kahit raw dagdag na tatlong taon lang—ako mismo ang tumutol dito,” Aquino said.“Di tayo makakasiguro kung malinis ang intensyon sa mga susunod, o kung nanaisin lang nilang habambuhay na maghari-harian para sa sariling interes. Panahon na para ipasa ang isang Anti-Dynasty Law,” he added.Binay served as Makati mayor for 20 years, from 1988 to 1998 and 2001 to 2010, before running for vice president. His wife Elenita Binay and son Junjun also took turns in being Makati mayor (Junjun is incumbent mayor).The 1987 Constitution states that the President is not eligible for reelection after a six-year term. It also says the Vice President is not eligible to run for more than two successive terms.But the anti-political dynasty bill in Congress is a watered down version of the original proposal to completely stamp out political clans in Congress. In the House of Representatives, the dynasty cap of one family member per politician has been raised to two. Congress is also looking at giving more leeway to clans by allowing them to be spread out in different jurisdictions in a manner which would not be deemed dynastic.‘Gaganda ang buhay‘Aquino seemed unfazed when he used his Sona to mock the party slogan of Binay’s United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) in the 2013 midterm elections – “Sa UNA, gaganda ang buhay.”Binay is again using the slogan to promote his presidential bid in 2016. He said he could lift many out of poverty, as he has claimed to do in Makati.Though not naming Binay and his party, Aquino turned to street language to express his disbelief at Binay’s platform of governance.“Siyempre po, kahit kaliwa’t kanan na ang ebidensiya ng pagbabago, mayroon pa ring kontra sa Daang Matuwid. Ang hirit nila: Mabagal daw tayo. Kapag sila raw ang naging Pangulo, sigurado, gaganda ang buhay. Sa mga medyo may-edad po, ang isasagot dito, “Ah, ganun?” sabay taas ng kilay. Para naman sa kabataan, ang sagot natin sa ganoong pahayag: E di wow,” Aquino said.Without directly naming Binay and his party, Aquino said these people have yet to give concrete solutions to the country’s problems.“Ang tanong natin: Paano nila gagawin ang mga pangakong iyan? Ang sagot nila: Basta. Nasaan ang detalye at kongkretong mga plano? Basta. Paano ninyo ipatutupad ang inyong mga pangako? Basta. Pakiramdam yata nila nadadaan sa basta-basta ang solusyon sa ating mga problema,” Aquino said.“Wala pa rin talagang gamot na naiimbento para sa mga nagbubulag-bulagan at nagbibingi-bingihan. Ang payo ko nga po: Maganda siguro, kapag ganitong harapan nang iniinsulto ang talino ng Pilipino, ilipat muna natin ang channel, at baka mas may mapala pa tayo sa panonood ng mga sitcom,” he added.‘Manhid,’ ‘palpak‘Aquino also hit Binay for what he deemed unfounded criticisms against his administration. During the launching of UNA, Binay called the Aquino administration “manhid” (insensitive) and “palpak” (bumbling).Aquino said Binay’s claims of his administration being insensitive was far from the truth, and used the expansion of the coverage of PhilHealth as an example.“Noong 2012, inanunsyo natin: Kung kabilang ang pamilya mo sa lowest quintile o ang pinakamahirap na 20 porsyento ng ating populasyon, at nagpagamot ka sa pampublikong ospital, sigurado, wala kang kailangang bayaran. Simula po noong 2014: Lumawak na iyan para saklawin ang susunod na quintile sa ating lipunan. Ibig sabihin, para sa pinakamahirap na 40 porsyento, libre na ring magpagamot sa mga pampublikong ospital. Ito po ‘yung pagkalingang tinatawag ng iba na palpak at manhid. Ang tugon ko po, sabi nga ni Aiza Seguerra noong araw: I thank you, bow,” Aquino said.Election a referendumAquino also said the next presidential elections would be a referendum on whether or not his “tuwid na daan” reform agenda would continue.“May sentimyentong umiiral na sa tingin ko, mahuhuli ng isang tanong, ang tanong po: “Lahat ba ng ating naipundar, lahat ba ng ating pinaghirapan, maglalaho dahil lang sa isang eleksiyon?” Aquino saidAfter he said this, the crowd was surprised when the faces of Binay, Senator Grace Poe and Roxas",1
"Dear Inquirer,The title of your article, “Leni slams growing culture of vigilantism”, published on July 13, 2016, in your newspaper caught my attention. I was aghast after reading it.1YOUR TITLE IS GROSSLY EXAGGERATED. You used the words, “Leni SLAMS growing culture of violence”. What a word to use, slam means to criticize harshly or to verbally attack.I read the entire article and did not see any quote that justifies using the word slam. More appropriate words are asserts, points out, highlights or emphasizes. However, those words are too weak in grabbing the attention of the readers. YOU ARE MISLEADING THE READERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO READ THE TITLES ONLY, who are the majority of the readers.In the same article, you wrote “Vice President Leni Robredo BLASTED a “growing culture of vigilantism and violence”. Really? Are the words SLAM and BLASTED appropriate?What did she really say?She just said, “While we are one with the fight against drugs, we are concerned with the growing culture of vigilantism and violence. We hope that the war is not done at the expense of the innocent and defenseless”. She is just concerned.She also said she supported Mr. Duterte’s declaration, “that the fight against drugs and crime must be done with an uncompromising exercise of the rule of law.”Furthermore, she also said, “We encourage authorities concerned to look into these cases. If there is really culpability, then justice requires that appropriate cases be filed and that those proven to be accountable be punished”. She is just making a suggestion.Finally, she said, “Since the President is a lawyer and former prosecutor, we trust that he will do what is appropriate, “After using the words SLAM and BLASTED, the writers quoted Vice President Robredo saying, “WE TRUST HE (President Duterte) WILL DO WHAT IS APPROPRIATE”. The writers suddenly shifted gear. Huh?Dissecting the ArticleFurther analysis of the article shows that only 9 paragraphs out of 29 paragraphs relate to the title of the article, the rest were about: unlikely drug lords; De Lima’s views on summary executions; the criticisms of Aquino allies in Solicitor General Jose Calida’s remarks questioning the basis for a congressional probe; and the lack of moral outcry from the general public as expressed by the CBCP.More than two-thirds of the article were other news items expressing the same concerns but from different sources. They were no longer statements that Vice President Robredo made.Inquirer, please practice responsible journalism.Citation:1. Aurelio, J.M., Salaverria, L.B., Dizon, N.. (2016, July 13).

"IN THE FACE of danger and uncertainty, a monastery in Cebu City provided shelter to a woman hunted by the Marcos dictatorship.The episode behind the cloistered walls of the Carmelite Monastery in Barangay Mabolo lasted for just 14 hours. But it was enough for Cory Aquino to get past the night when she was reportedly the prime target of an assassination plot by the military.After three decades, the Carmelite nuns recall with gratitude the time when they opened their doors to Cory and a few companions.“We need to keep the memory alive. We need to keep on telling the story just like how the Hebrews relive the story of redemption. By paying attention to history, we learn lessons,” said 87-year-old mother Mary Aimee Ataviado, who served as the mother superior of the Carmelite nuns when Cory spent a night in the monastery in 1986.Except for their regular Mass and prayer schedules, the nuns have not prepared any special activity to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Cory’s overnight stay at the monastery as well as the Edsa People Power Revolution.But the twin events will always have an indelible mark in the history of the Carmelite order in Cebu.Phone callAtaviado can still clearly remember a phone call from Cory’s close friend, Nancy Cuenco, around 8:30 p.m. on Feb. 22, 1986.“It was my birthday. The nuns were washing the dishes after dinner when Nancy called me up and asked if she could bring Cory because she was in danger,” she told the Inquirer.That day, Cory and her running mate, Salvador “Doy” Laurel, were in Cebu to launch a civil disobedience campaign against Ferdinand Marcos at Fuente Osmeña past 6 p.m. Also with them were Cory’s youngest daughter, Kris, then 14, and her brother, Jose “Peping” Cojuangco.Cory’s supporters requested her to spend the night in Cebu since it was dangerous to return to Manila.At the time, Lt. Gen. Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Armed Forces Vice Chief of Staff Fidel Ramos had just withdrawn support from Marcos, and throngs of Filipinos began to gather in the streets of Manila, calling for the ouster of Marcos.DiversionWhile having dinner with opposition leaders, Cuenco called up Ataviado whom she requested to accommodate Cory and her companions. Ataviado agreed.To divert the attention of military officers who were tasked to monitor Cory, a convoy made its way to Mactan Cebu International Airport.The military intelligence agents didn’t have an idea that Cory was in a white Ford sedan driven by Cuenco’s husband Antonio, who brought her to the Carmelite Monastery.It took some time before Cory reached the monastery because the group still had to look for Kris. After a frantic search, they found out that Cory’s teenage daughter was just shopping in Cebu with friends, Ataviado said.Cory’s group arrived at the Carmelite Monastery past 9 p.m.Ataviado said the nuns let the car pass by a smaller gate, which was intended for the delivery of supplies. The Carmelites also turned the lights off so that no outsider would know about Cory’s arrival.Like ‘Sound of Music’Once inside the gate, Ataviado said Cory exclaimed “Oh, it’s like the ‘Sound of Music,’ alluding to the Broadway musical.And then, she asked us, “Is it safe here?” Out of the blue, I answered, “They have to kill us first before they reach you.” Because of that, she felt safe, the mother superior said.The Carmelite Monastery was supposed to be off limits to outsiders because contemplative nuns live there under papal enclosure.Heads of state are exempted from such rule.But at that time, it wasn’t clear who between Cory and Marcos won in the Feb. 7, 1986, snap presidential election.Marcos, who was President of the country for two decades, called for the snap election to prove that he still had the support of Filipinos. He was declared winner by the Commission on Elections, but his victory was marred by reports of fraud, violence and disenfranchisement of voters.Based on its own quick count, the National Citizens’ Movement for Free Elections had Cory winning in the snap election.Nobody was supposed to enter the monastery but the nuns allowed Cory in because they believed she won in the election and so she was the rightful head of state at that point in time,Ataviado said.“We let her in with a clear conscience that we didn’t violate any Church rules. For us, she was the head of state. If we believed otherwise, we could have done something against our regulations,” she added.Cory and Kris were supposed to occupy the most comfortable room on the monastery’s second floor. It has two big windows and a terrace, but Ataviado said Cory didn’t feel safe staying in that room.Cory instead chose a smaller room where religious images and office supplies were kept.Ataviado said the nuns cleared the room and placed two beds for Cory and Kris. “We did our best to arrange it,” the mother superior said.The nuns gave Peping Cojuangco another room, while spouses Nancy and Antonio Cuenco occupied another room.Past 11 p.m., Cory was seen praying the Holy Rosary in her room before she slept. The nuns, who stayed up all night, also prayed.Loud bangingAround 2 a.m., while the guests were asleep, Ataviado said the Carmelites heard loud banging at the iron gate.“We (nuns) were all very scared. I was trembling, thinking that the soldiers of Marcos had arrived,” Ataviado said.The nuns, she said, started to think of plans to hide Cory and Kris. They thought of letting the two guests wear their habits and pretend to be nuns.There was also a suggestion to hide Cory and Kris at the ceiling above the choir loft.The nuns did not open the gates and instead hid in fear inside the monastery. After about 30 minutes, the noise outside stopped.When morning arrived, they learned that the persons who banged the gates were Cory’s supporters, Ramon Mitra Jr., John Osmeña and Aquilino Pimentel Jr. who just wanted to join the group inside the monastery.Cory woke up around 6 a.m. and attended Mass in the monastery.BreakfastAfter which, Cory, Kris and the other guests had breakfast. Most of the food served were leftovers from the mother superior’s birthday dinner.The menu included eggs cooked sunny-side up, sliced bread, puto (a Filipino rice cake shaped like an American muffin), bibingka (another type of rice cake that is traditionally cooked in clay pots lined with banana leaves), sikwati (hot native chocolate) and fresh papaya.After breakfast, Cory received visitors who included US Consul Blaire Porter.She was given the assurance that the United States would protect her in going back to Manila. The consul even offered a submarine so she could go back to Manila, Ataviado said.Step downWhile they were at the monastery, Cory’s supporters requested her to prepare a speech she was to deliver when she arrived in Manila. The message she wrote urged other government leaders to defect from Marcos. She also asked Marcos to step down.Despite the tension, the nuns noticed that Cory had kept her faith and entrusted everything to God.“She was very prayerful, a woman of God,” Ataviado said.Cory left the monastery around 11 a.m. of Feb. 23, 1986, two days before Marcos relinquished his post and fled to Hawaii with his family in exile.When Marcos left the country, Cory was sworn into office, becoming the first woman President of the Philippines.Cory’s visitsShortly before her six-year term ended in 1992, she returned to the Carmelite Monastery to visit the place where she took refuge at a time when her life was at risk. It was followed by two other visits, the last of which was in 1996.Ataviado entertained queries and showed the Inquirer photographs of Cory’s visits to the Carmelite Monastery. The elderly superior was accompanied by four other nuns, who were present during the 1986 visit. They were Sisters Marietta Paul Maluenda, Melanie Costillos and Maria Luz Tapales.As the country marks the 30th anniversary of the Edsa People Power Revolution, the mother superior encouraged every Filipino not to waste the efforts of those who worked hard for freedom and democracy.“[If we look at our history], God is really taking care of us. Let us continue to learn from the events of life and do our best to do God’s will because the progress of the nation and the salvation of our souls depend on it,” she said.“We can say that God really has a mission for the Philippines. There is no end to problems, but we have to keep on working [for the good of our country],” she added.",1
"Business leaders are supportive of President Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs and have lauded his political will, according to the chairman emeritus of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI).PCCI Chairman Emeritus Francis Chua said heads of various chambers of commerce approve of Mr. Duterte’s leadership, particularly his will to curb the country’s drug problem.“You will be surprised that a lot of [business leaders] are saying this is the kind of the President that the Asean needs,” Chua told reporters on the sidelines of the opening of the 13th China-Asean Expo (Caexpo) and the 13th China-Asean Business and Investment Summit (Cabis) held here on Sunday.“In some countries in Asia, their leaders are not strong enough. We really pray hard for the success of President Duterte. If he succeeds, then that’s a story that everybody could follow and emulate,” he added.Chua, who is also the president of the newly formed Philippine-Silk Road International Chamber, said business leaders are not worried about the alleged human-rights violations committed by some officials in their bid to curb the drug menace.",0
"Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson filed a case against a still not yet identified PCOO staff that became her source of the ‘misleading Marawi City photo’ that eventually discovered that only grabbed from Rappler.The photo was posted by Mocha last Sunday, October 23 with a caption “Grabe naman ang bilis naman kumilos ng gobyerno.”.Quickly, Rappler posted on their Facebook fan page, clarifying that the photo used by Asec. Mocha in her blog was taken by their correspondent Bobby Lagsa that taken on the 3rd day of Marawi Siege and not after President Rodrigo Duterte declared its liberation.On Saturday, a ‘leaked’ document showed that the PCOO assistant secretary is planning to sue the ‘unnamed’ person who became the reason why Mocha posted the Marawi photo.According to the document, Mocha got the controversial photo from ‘Mula sa Masa Para sa Masa’ Facebook page, however she was the one who blamed by Rappler for spreading ‘fake news’.She also asked the Viber group of the PCOO, but her colleagues didn’t disclosed the name of the person who made her to the headlines and just told her that they already ‘dealt’ with that person.This made her asked PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar to conduct an investigation to unmask the staff who grabbed the controversial photo from Rappler.“I am therefore constrained to inquire with your office, as the appointing authority of the said unnamed person to conduct an investigation on the same, discover the name and designation of the person responsible for the offending picture and if the evidence warrants, initiate the appropriate administrative case against the said unnamed person.” Uson said.Leaked document shows Mocha Uson asking PCOO Sec. Martin Andanar to identify the person who misled her.She also made a statement on her Facebook page, explaining that she’s not the source of the photo and she was also mislead by the post of Mula sa Masa Para sa Masa fan page.“Gusto ko lamang po klaruhin na ang photo na ginamit ko po dito ay galing sa MULA SA MASA, PARA SA MASA PAGE na isa sa mga OPISYAL na pahayagan ng PCOO. Wala po tayong intention linlangin ang tao tulad na sinasabi ng Rappler dahil nga ito ay galing sa OPISYAL NA PAHAYAGAN NG PCOO. At bilang Assistant Secretary for Social Media ng PCOO ay akin lamang po itong ibinahagi sa Social Media,” she said.Secretary Andanar said that the case is already under investigation and administrative case shall be filed against the source of the misleading photo.",0
"The regional office of the Department of Health (DOH) here on Friday has reported an increase in the number of cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Northeastern Mindanao or Caraga region.A disease surveillance report of the DOH 13 obtained by The Manila Bulletin showed that 14 new HIV-AIDS cases were recorded for the month of May 2018. In the same month last year, 12 HIV-AIDs cases were recorded.As of May 2018 alone, out of 14 cases, 14 (100%) cases were acquired through sexual contact in which 8 (57%) of these cases is through homosexual contact, it said.DOH 13 said that from year 1995 to May 2018, HIV cases now total 538 for Caraga region alone, with 14 reported new HIV cases.However, from 1984 to the present, there have been 42 related deaths, DOH 13 record said.One new death was also recorded in January this year.In a cumulative list from 1995 to May 2018, topping the list in Caraga region is Butuan City where 166 cases were registered, followed by Surigao del Norte with 107 cases, Agusan del Sur with 105 cases, Surigao del Sur with 98 cases, Agusan del Norte with 58 cases and Dinagat Islands province with 4 cases.The DOH is providing antiretroviral (ARV) medicine for free to anyone who tests positive for HIV.With this development, the regional office of the DOH 13 here is urging the public to visit the Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) Center, particularly at the Butuan City Medical Center’s treatment hub.",1
"After just seven months of investigation, the Ombudsman found probable cause to order the filing of graft charges against former Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya and 16 others over the awarding of P4.25 billion in Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT 3) maintenance contracts to an unqualified and ineligible contractor in 2015.The Ombudsman said the joint venture of Busan Universal Rail Inc. (Buri) did not have the technical experience and financial capability to handle the long-term maintenance of MRT 3.Yet Department of Transportation and Communications officials “intentionally” disregarded the procurement rules and adjusted the eligibility requirements to accommodate the Buri bid.The Ombudsman, however, found no basis to charge Abaya with plunder because there was no evidence to show that public funds went to the official’s pocket or that of the Busan joint venture incorporators.",1
"The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday was asked by a survivor and relatives of four slain garbage collectors to stop the Philippine National Police (PNP) from conducting so-called tokhang operations in enforcing the government’s war on drugs.Members of the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) were implicated in the death of the four employees in the 2016 incident.The demand came after a petition for a writ of amparo was lodged before the High Court, seeking protection from the tribunal against alleged abuses of some members of the PNP.The writ of amparo is a remedy available to any person whose right to life, liberty and security is violated or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or of a private individual or entity.The petitioners are Efren Morillo, 28, and the lone survivor in a police anti-drug operation, and relatives of fatalities Marcelo Daa, 31; Jessie Cule, 20-25; Raffy Gabo, 23; and Anthony Comendo, 26.Named respondents to the case are the PNP headed by Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa; Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, QCPD director; Supt. Lito Patay, QCPD Station 6 commander; Senior Inspector Emil Garcia; Police Officer 3 Allan Formilleza; PO1 James Aggarao; and PO1 Melchor Navisaga.The petitioners alleged that there was a tokhang operation in the house of victim Daa on August 21, 2016 at Group 9, Area B, Payatas, Quezon City.It was stated that a group of five armed men and two women wearing civilian clothes entered their house and accused the victims of involvement in illegal drugs.According to the petitioners, the intruders ransacked the house, planted drug evidence against the fatalities, took personal belongings and mercilessly shot Daa, Cule, Gabo, Comendo and Morillo, execution style.Morillo survived by playing dead.“Thus, respondents [QCPD policemen] had no authority to conduct ‘Oplan: Tokhang’ in Barangay Payatas, where the incident occurred. It is thus quite obvious that they fabricated evidence to make it appear that they had jurisdiction to conduct ‘Oplan: Tokhang’ operations where the incident occurred.“Otherwise, if it were indeed a legimate operation, there is no need to lie about the place of the incident,” the petition read.The petitioners said the PNP claimed before the media that its men killed the alleged drug suspects in a legitimate tokhang operation, branding the four garbage collectors as notorious drug suspects and robbers.They denied the allegations, calling them lies fabricated by the Quezon City police.The petitioners said “the incident on 21 August 2016 was not a legitimate police operation that resulted in a shootout between suspects and policemen” but a “summary execution that was enabled by ‘Oplan: Tokhang.’”“The attempt to cover up the crime and glorify it as a police achievement is achieved through a systematic conspiracy among different units of the same police district, part of which is to silence and frighten possible witnesses and aggrieved parties from speaking up in the name of justice,” their petition read.Around 7,000 individuals have died in the anti-drug war declared by President Rodrigo Duterte when he assumed office in July this year.The petitioners sought the High Court’s intervention for immediate issuance of a temporary protection order (TPO) directing respondents to refrain from issuing or carrying out any threat to the life, liberty and security of petitioners; and prohibition against entering within a radius of 5-kilometers of the residences and work addresses of petitioners.Also sought was a “TPO against the implementation of ‘Oplan: Tokhang’ in Area B, Barangay Payatas, and all areas under QCPD Station 6; production order directing respondents to produce and permit the inspection and copying or photographing of intelligence and surveillance reports, police blotters, coordination, video and all other official and unofficial documents and materials pertaining to the police operations on the day of the subject incident; and privilege of the writ of amparo for the long-term protection of petitioners.”",1
"Not a single mining company ordered suspended by then-Secretary Regina Lopez of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has been fined by the Duterte administration for damages to the environment.DENR Secretary Roy Cimatu was referring to at least 22 mining companies ordered suspended by Lopez for violations of the Mining Law.Not a single mining company, however, closed shop because all the owners of the 22 companies affected by the closure order appealed Lopez’s decision before the Office of the President.“We are yet to do that [impose fines] because the decision is yet to be reached on supposed penalties for those [ordered] suspended. Maybe by the end of the year, when the decision has been reached, they will be penalized. There are no [final] findings yet on these 22 [mining] companies,” Cimatu told reporters.During his second State of the Nation Address, President Rodrigo Duterte said he will hold the local government units “absolutely responsible for any misdeed or failure by the mining entities to comply with laws.”Based on Cimatu’s accounts, the violations committed by mining companies include spillage of mining operations on sea water, illegal logging and violation of the terms of the Environmental Compliance Certificate.“We are doing very rigid auditing on mining companies because we really want to improve mining practices,” Cimatu said.He, however, refused to comment on the merits of Lopez’s findings, which resulted in ordering the suspension of the mining companies.The order earned Lopez a lot of flak and eventually led to her appointment’s rejection by the Commission on Appointments.“I’m sorry I can’t answer that question because I don’t want to preempt the ongoing auditing process [reviewing Lopez’s order],” Cimatu said.Before she was ousted from her post, Lopez also pushed for the imposition of P2 million trust fund dues on mining companies for every hectare of land disturbed by mining operations.This P2 million per hectare trust fund is on top of what is provided under the Philippine Mining Act of 1995, which requires mining companies to set aside P10 percent of the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Programs costs or P 5 million (whichever is lower) to be used as a rehabilitation cash source.The fund is managed by a committee composed of the Mines and Geosciences Board regional director, DENR regional executive director and representatives of the local government unit, the non-government organizations and the contractors.Cimatu said the government is yet to lift the ban on open-pit mining—a policy instituted by Lopez—even if President Duterte said he approves of open-pit mining, provided that the mining firm extends assistance to communities that are affected.The Mining and Geosciences Board has called for the lifting of the ban on open-pit mining, saying open-pit mining in the country is “technically and financially feasible.”“Mining companies will be given elbow room. He said this in the Cabinet meeting. We will take our cue from the President’s statements. We have asked the Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC) to translate the President’s instruction into specific guidance,” Cimatu said.He added that he is also in favor of increasing the two percent excise tax rates for mining companies but deferred to the MICC to state a figure.",1
"Filipino-Australian Jim Paredes, Duterte critic and former member of the music group Apo Hiking Society, is missing!After that viral video tape showing him berating a group of pro-Duterte youth at the EDSA 31 commeration, he hasn’t been seen around. There are no indications that he has returned to Australia.But finally, Paredes has given a clue on his whereabouts.In a tweet posted several days ago, Paredes said:But his Twitter message generated more questions than answers. Both his fans and critics still have no clue where he is.Speculations range from Paredes having joined the New People’s Army or Abu Sayyaf to being in an anti-Duterte rally where only 40 people were in attendance. Others are saying that he could be vacationing in Brazil’s Amazon forest, where as a Filipino citizen, he doesn’t need a visa to visit.Or maybe, he has decided to be a monk?",0
"Why not give up your slot instead?University of the Philippines (UP) students on Friday hurled this challenge to President Duterte after the Chief Executive threatened to give the scholarship slots of protesting students to young members of indigenous peoples (IPs) or “lumad.”The UP students walked out of their classes in Diliman, Quezon City, on Thursday to join street protests during the National Day of Walkout Against Tyranny and Dictatorship.“If there is anyone who needs to give up his slot, it is none other than Rodrigo Duterte himself,” the militant student group Stand-UP said in a statement.Stand-UP, whose acronym means Student Alliance for the Advancement of Democratic Rights in UP, also slammed the President for his flip-flopping stance on the lumad, whom he had threatened to bomb last year.The Kabataan party-list group said the administration could expect more class walkouts to denounce the President’s “dictatorship.”‘Free education’ scam“His statement exposes the true nature of his ‘free education’ scam: not all will benefit; instead of guaranteeing the right of every child to education, he dangles it around every time there is opposition to his fanatical dictatorship,” Kabataan Rep. Sarah Elago said in a statement on Friday.“On Feb. 23, expect even more students to walk out of their classes to fight Duterte’s dictatorship and tyrannical attacks on the youth and the people,” Elago added.In a statement on Friday, Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao also slammed Mr. Duterte’s threat to kick out protesting UP students as an “act of oppression” and said that the youth and students “do not answer to Duterte but to the oppressed Filipino people.”UP students, faculty and alumni had a similar response to Mr. Duterte’s threat: Expect more rallies ahead.“The Iskolar ng Bayan is geared to launch bigger protest actions, most especially because (the President’s) recent policies, such as the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion law, attack the democratic rights of the Filipino,” said Shari Oliquino, who represents the student body in the board of regents, the highest policymaking body in the university.Journalism professor Danilo Arao of the UP College of Mass Communication described the President’s threat as tantamount to curtailing free speech and dissent.“Authoritarianism covers utter disregard for human rights,” the UP alumnus said. “At the rate he’s going, history could end up remembering (Mr. Duterte) as worse than the [late dictator Ferdinand] Marcos.”Arao added: “Hope Duterte heeds this warning: Don’t pick a fight with the militant youth. You won’t win,” he said.The Save Our Schools Network Mindanao, an alliance of organizations advocating the rights of indigenous children, stood by the protesting UP students.“They provided us sanctuary and solidarity [when the] lumad students were [being] threatened by the President [who said] he would order the bombing of their schools,” recalled its spokesperson Rius Valle.In a speech during the Mindanao IP leaders’ summit in Davao City on Thursday, the President addressed the protesting UP students: “Get out of there and I will give (your slots) to intelligent (tribal people) here. I’ll put them in your stead.”“Do not go to school anymore. Just stay on the streets,” the President added.IronicCasilao said he found ironic Mr. Duterte’s threat to give away the UP students’ scholarship slots to the lumad when the President had threatened to bomb the indigenous peoples’ schools in November last year on suspicion that these were being used to teach students to rebel against the government.“Now suddenly, he wants the lumad to continue their schooling while the militarization of their communities, including their schools, continues,” he added.Casilao also scored Mr. Duterte’s pronouncement that he would personally choose investors for the lumads’ ancestral domain.In a recent speech, the President asked hundreds of lumad leaders in Mindanao to open up their ancestral domain to investors, a move long opposed by communities whose lands are protected under the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act.“(The President) intends to sell the IP lands to local oligarchs and foreign investors. This only means the wholesale auction of IP lands which definitely displaces thousands of indigenous people out of their communities,” the Anakpawis representative said.Stand-UP said the bigger protest on Feb. 23 would not only gather students, but also teachers, administrators and vendors from the entire UP community.",1
"The three regional wage boards in the Visayas have approved an increase of P13.50 to P41.50 in the daily minimum pay of workers in the private sector to help them cope with rising prices of basic commodities.The adjustments would raise the minimum wage to up to P305 in Eastern Visayas, P365 in Western Visayas and P386 in Central Visayas—way below the demand of labor groups in the country.Amid soaring prices of goods and services, the party-list group Trade Union Congress of the Philippines has filed a bill seeking a P320 across-the-board wage increase in all regions that would lift the minimum daily pay to between P576 and P832.The Makabayan bloc in the House has also filed a measure that would raise basic wage nationwide to P750.MigrationOn Tuesday, the Associated Labor Unions assailed the wage increases in Western and Central Visayas, saying these would do little to help improve workers’ lives and would only promote migration to urban centers.The highest adjustment was granted in Western Visayas, where the wage board agreed to raise the minimum pay by P13.50 to P41.50, with cost of living allowances (Cola).In Eastern and Central Visayas, the boards agreed to pay increases of P15 to P20, based on the capacity of the business sector to absorb the amounts without having to retrench workers.Moratorium in BoracayJohnson Cañete, the Department of Labor and Employment director in Western Visayas, said there would be a moratorium on wage adjustment on Boracay Island, which was closed to tourism for six months while it was being rehabilitated.The moratorium will be lifted three months after the island reopens, said Cañete, who is also the chair of the Regional Tripartite Wage and Productivity Board.The biggest wage increase went to nonagricultural, commercial and industrial business establishments employing more than 10 workers. Their minimum wage would go up by P41.50 (P26.50 plus P15 in Cola), bringing their floor pay to P365.For businesses with less than 10 workers, an additional P18.50 and P5 in Cola were approved, raising their minimum wage to P295.Unified subcategoriesThe wage order, Cañete said, also unified the plantation and nonplantation subcategories for the agricultural sector and increased the salaries to P295, including a P5 Cola.In the sugar industry, the Cola would be added to the pay only after six months, in time for the start of milling season.In Eastern Visayas, daily minimum wage in both agriculture and nonagriculture sectors will be P305.Cyril Ticao, labor regional director, said the board adjusted the wages on its own, without waiting for someone to file a petition.“We took into consideration the increasing prices (of basic commodities) and gasoline,” Ticao said.In Central Visayas, Metro Cebu workers will receive the biggest wage increase of P20, bringing their floor pay to P386.But for workers outside Metro Cebu and the rest of Cebu province, Bohol, Siquijor and Negros Oriental, the wage adjustment will only amount to P15.Workers in the cities of Toledo and Bogo, and other towns in Cebu, except Bantayan and Camotes islands, will get a P348 basic pay.A minimum wage of P338 will be in effect in Bohol and Negros Oriental, and P323 in Siquijor, Bantayan and Camotes.",1
"the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China.The draft, seen by Reuters on Sunday, no longer proposes blacklisting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The initial draft proposed he be subjected to a travel ban and asset freeze along with four other North Korea officials. The final text only lists one of those officials.The draft text still proposes a ban on textile exports, which were North Korea’s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. Nearly 80 percent of the textile exports went to China.The draft drops a proposed oil embargo and instead intends to impose a ban on condensates and natural gas liquids, a cap of two million barrels a year on refined petroleum products, and a cap crude oil exports to North Korea at current levels.Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for a boost to the country’s defenses in the face of North Korean threats, warning that Tokyo needs to be able to protect itself.‘’We have to take all appropriate measures against (incidents such as) North Korea’s missile launch over Japan,’’ added the premier, who said he had asked his defense minister to draw up a blueprint for Japan’s medium-term defense strategy.The September 3 detonation was the North Korea’s largest and prompted global outrage, with the UN Security Council set to discuss a new draft resolution presented by Washington that would be the toughest-ever imposed against the isolated regime.The US is calling for an oil embargo on Pyongyang, an assets freeze on leader Kim Jong Un, but also an end to textile exports and to payments made to North Korean guest workers.Washington wants the Security Council to vote on Monday to impose the sanctions, despite resistance from Beijing and Moscow to the new measures.In a statement published by the official KCNA news agency, North Korea’s foreign ministry warned Washington that if it did ‘’rig up the illegal and unlawful ‘resolution’ on harsher sanctions, the DPRK shall make absolutely sure that the US pays due price.’’",1
"The viral interview of BBC HARDtalk host Stephen Sackur to senator Antonio Trillanes IV tremendously raised the popularity of the prominent journalist to social media users in the Philippines.According to some supporters of President Duterte, they never expected that a journalist from a western country would made an unbiased interview to the fiercest critic of the current administration.Netizens were entertained how the direct and frank Stephen Sackur literally gave a hard talk to senator Antonio Trillanes IV who took the chance to criticize the President in the international media.Several Duterte supporters even wrote an open letter to thank the BBC host for what he did.MJ Quiambao Reyes, a pro-Duterte blogger wrote an open letter to the BBC Host and praised him for doing an in-depth research before interviewing senator Trillanes.She also gave some information that Stephen Sackur can use when he decided to interview another member of the opposition in his show.Allow me please to correct and add a few information which may be helpful in your future episodes/interviews: 1. The present admin., contrary to what this overly ambitious Mr. Trillanes wants the international community to believe, has no propaganda machine. It is the other way around: The Duterte detractors–composed mostly of narcopoliticians, losing political party, and greedy oligarchs directly and indirectly connected to some local & foreign news agencies and whose lives and wealth are obviously threatened by the new admin–are the ones relentlessly spending multi-millions and are desperately moving heaven and earth to overthrow the President. 2. Meanwhile, it is us, the millions of ordinary Filipinos worldwide and active Filipino netizens, who stepped up voluntarily and are using the social media to help correct the false narratives and distorted information that the likes of Mr. Trillanes have been feeding the international community. 3. The “7,000/9,000” is the total number of murder/homicide cases–much of the said figure are not related to the on-going drug war. 3. In the previous admin prior to Duterte, the annual homicide & murder cases were 11,500-16,200 (2011-2015). 4. There are now 1.3 million drug personalities who surrenderered–alive and unharmed. 5. There are about 83,000 drug personalities arrested–alive and unharmed. 6. Contrary to Mr. Trillanes’ claim, the 1.3 million drug personalities who surrendered and the 83K arrested are not all poor. Several high-value targets were arrested or killed during legitimate police operations–including wealthy and powerful politicians as well as police scalawags who were connected to drug syndicates. 7. Our govt. has put in place mega drug rehab centers and has also launched several rehabilitation and reintegration programs. 8. Total crime rate in the Philippines has dropped by about 30% compared to previous year.Quiambao also suggested to Sackur that he may invite President Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo in his show.Krizette Laureta Chu, one of the first pro-Duterte bloggers who watched the interview of Stephen Sackur to senator Trillanes, thanked him for ‘exposing how ignorant, malicious, and stup*d senator Trillanes is in this hard hitting interview’Chu told Sackur in his letter that there is no Duterte propaganda machine and she explained that mostly of the Duterte supporters are consisted of ‘patriotic, hopeful Filipinos who see Duterte’s vision and appreciates it’She even tried to reach Sackur and voiced out her opinion about President Rodrigo Duterte and senator Antonio Trillanes.former DILG secretary Rafael Alunan praised Sackur for his interview. He also said that the more Trillanes talked during the interview, ‘the more he sank in quicksand’“Stephen Sackur saw him for what he is – a fraud. His questions peeled him wide open for all the world to see.” Rafael Alunan said.Alunan also said that Trillanes drowned by the questions thrown to him by Sackur.Hedda Joy Tady Tan, who introduced himself as an ordinary citizen, conveyed her sense of gratitude to the BBC for the things that he did during the interview.Tan said that Sackur ‘focused on the facts’ and also reminded senator Trillanes what was the true pulse of the people.She also said that Sackur proven that not all the members of the media accepted money to publish one-sided stories about the Philippines.“You, a FOREIGNER, had the COURAGE to march outside the ranks of everyone else who’s just been producing CRAP on mainstream media for more than one year into our current Filipino story. MABUHAY ka!” Tan said in her post.Malcolm Conlan, a British who lives in the Philippines labeled Sackur as an ‘excellent, very knowledgable and well researched journalist on tackling Philippine senator Trillanes, who seems to be on mission to destabilize the Philippines and oust President Rodrigo Duterte from office’He also believed that Stephen seemed to indicate that he admired President Rodrigo Duterte’s ‘honesty’ to the people.“Clearly this interview didn’t go as well as Senator Trillianes would have wanted and quite clearly Senator Trillianes ended up looking a bit silly and desperate really. I am very pleased that the BBC saw right through the ploy of Trillianes to try to destroy the reputation of PRRD overseas and spread lies and fake news,” Malcolm Conlan said in his post.These are the other messages of the netizens to Stephen Sackur:Netizens expected that Stephen Sackur invited more Filipino politicians in his show because they are waiting for his another hard-hitting interview.",0
"America? Miski ako hindi ako makapunta doon, hindi ako bigyan ng visa ng mga..” he said. He narrated when asked what would happen if he decided to marry and stay in the US. Sabi ko, Mr. Consul, even if you offer me free visas for a lifetime and even if you offer me 10,000 dollars, Id still return to my country and be a Filipino, Duterte recalled and the crowd broke into cheers. The problem is you go to America? You’ll not be issued a visa, he stressed.",0
"Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) Chief Persida Acosta became emotional while denying Senator Hontiveros claims that there’s a pattern on killings in Duterte’s war against illegal drugs.During the senate probe on the death of Kian Delos Santos, Acosta clarified that PAO didn’t pronounced that there’s a patter on killings in the drug war of President Duterte contradicted to the claims of Senator Hontiveros who quoted the PAO several times during the hearing.“Mawalang galang na ho kay Senator Hontiveros, wala hong pronouncement ang PAO na may pattern dito. Uulitin ko po, walang polisiya ang gobyerno na pumatay ng walang awa,” Acosta said.She also defended the cops who are willing to sacrifice their lives to fulfill their duty in the country because the controversies made all the cops even the good ones looked bad.“Ako na mismo ang makakapagpatotoo na walang inuutos sa mga pulis na pumatay ng walang kaawa awa, kaya po yung mga kliyente namin, 80,000 plus nakakulong.. buhay hinuli ng mga kapulisan natin,” she said.“Kasi kawawa naman yung mga pulis na handang ibuwis ang kanilang buhay para sa inang bayan parang nalalahat na sila,nasasaktan po ako dahil madami rin po kaming kliyente na pulis na pinagtangol namin noon hanggang ngayon” she addedShe clarified that PAO pointed out the similarity between Kian Delos Santos and Carl Aranaiz.“Wala po kaming sinasabing pattern, lilinawin ko lang.. yung similarity lang ng kaso ni Kian at ni Carl.. parehong teenager, parehong OFW ang nanay, parehong may munting tindahan sa harap ng kanilang tahanan, parehong maayos ang itsura at wala sa drug list ng mga barangay, yun po yun pero wala po kaming sinabi na may pattern na mayroong utos [ang gobyerno] na pumatay, wala hong ganon,” PAO Chief Acosta said.But Hontiveros explained that they only quoted what Acosta said during her radio interview on DZMM.“Ang punto dito buhay ito eh bakit ganito ang pattern, parang may pagkakahalintulad ito kay Kian,” Hontiveros said while quoting what Acosta said during the radio interview.In the video posted by CNN Philippines, it also showed PNP Chief Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa, still wiping his tears after defending the PNP against the accusations that the PNP were ordered to kill anyone in the form of war against illegal drugs.You can watch the whole video here:",0
"Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno on Thursday said the government would not be able to fulfill President Duterte’s commitment to double the basic salary of state forces in his first year in office, saying the P3.35-trillion proposed budget for 2017 did not include allocation for such purpose.Mr. Duterte’s vow to increase the gross pay of personnel of the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines was an integral part of his campaign during the May 9 elections, which he anchored on a no-nonsense approach to solving crimes.The President said providing better compensation to law enforcement agents would discourage them from engaging in unlawful activities like protecting illegal drug syndicates.He even dangled cash reward of as much as P5 million to policemen who would kill big-time drug lords.However, Diokno said the realization of the President’s campaign promise may have to be on the back burner for the meantime as the government would have to address other pressing financial issues besetting the PNP and the AFP.“There’s none. It’s not included,” Diokno said when asked if the 2017 budget contained the salary increase of soldiers and policemen as promised by the President.“We’re studying that. In fact, we are trying to consider everything. The problem is that the government already owes so much to the pension fund of the (soldiers) and policemen. It has ballooned,” he said after presenting the Duterte administration’s first proposed budget.But the budget chief said AFP and PNP personnel would receive a pay increase next year as part of the second tranche of the Salary Standardization Law which then President Benigno Aquino III had signed.Diokno said he would discuss the matter with Mr. Duterte, who was known to adopt the carrot-and-stick approach in disciplining policemen when he was the mayor of Davao City.He said he would announce “in two weeks’ time” how the Department of Budget and Management would address the issue.“We want to bring it up with the President, but we have to be sensitive on how to address this problem. Otherwise, the day will come that 80 percent of the military budget would be on pension only,” Diokno warned.He noted that soldiers usually “live longer” after retiring from the service at the age of 56 as mandated by law.“They (soldiers) retire early and … live long. Look at FVR. He’s still alive,” he said, referring to former President Fidel Ramos, a retired chief of the Philippine Constabulary, the PNP’s predecessor.“In fact, the pension of the military is higher than the salary of the incumbent (personnel). That’s how big that problem is. And nobody talked about this for the last 15 years,” Diokno said.Asked if the government would have to postpone the purchase of military hardware, he said: “I think so.”Diokno then broached the idea of enlisting the services of members of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps who, he said, were not entitled to pension benefits.“For me, I’m for smaller, leaner, better-trained Armed Forces,” he said.",1
"It isn’t much of a preparation as there is neither vision nor platform to give meaning to their pitch to the Filipino voter. The fact, however, that the Philippine Opposition led by the Liberal Party (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) are now on full campaign mode in the lead up to the 2019 elections exhibits their grudging faith in Philippine democracy — a faith that contradicts what they shriek about in their rallies and media circuses.Indeed, many “thought leaders” of the Yellowtards continue to screech about their new lame narrative surrounding an imagined “descent to dictatorship”. An example of this shrill but lazy “activism” can be seen in prominent Yellowtard Francis Baraan IV who observes…I am quite concerned about the state of our democracy, too. We’re not just inching towards a dictatorship, we’re sliding fast down into a dictatorship. #Duterte doesn’t even need to place the country under #MartialLaw. It’s practically Martial Law.Even more interesting is that this is in response to an earlier observation issued by what seems to be a British national on the state of health of this democracy…@MrFrankBaraan Hope you’re well Francis… I’m really concerned about the state of democracy in the Philippines, and Duterte even locking up lawyers who speak out against him. You need another democratic uprising before it’s too late!Note the recommended course of action — “another democratic uprising”. One would think that if the Yellowtards really think that democracy is “dead” then there wouldn’t really be any point in participating in the coming democratic exercise, the 2019 mid-term elections.For that matter, what does a “democratic uprising” even mean? Current President Rodrigo Duterte, warts and all, is the duly-elected Chief Executive of the Philippines. Any sort of extra-constitutional “uprising” will be anything but democratic. It will be no more than another one of those garden-variety coup d’etats that have become mainstays of Yellowtard ideology. Democratic institutions and process be damned so long as the Yellowtards get what they want. That’s as close to a platform these political parasites could cough up.If the Yellowtards are truly convinced that democracy is “dead” then they should walk their talk. Mount this “uprising” they keep yakking about. Now na! You can’t be a “revolutionary” and a participant in due process at the same time. You either take a shit or get off the can. Otherwise you come across as just as lame as the communists who have one ass cheek in legitimate democratic politics and another up in the mountains killing Filipinos and the soldiers who defend them.The only way the Yellowtards can truly prove that they are “defending” or even “fighting for” democracy is to participate in it legitimately and win legitimately. More often than not, this involves being intelligent enough to play by those rules and succeed at overcoming a formidable opponent. The way the Yellowtards are approaching this challenge, however, they’d much prefer upturning the chessboard in the middle of the game, hitting their opponent on the head with it, then storming away. The chess match is not won, but it makes for a great media circus.",0
"Netizen Dan Jimenez posted a special report made by authors hiding in pseudonym ‘Dimasalang’, ‘Mulawin’ and ‘Judea’ on how the Filipino journalist and foreign correspondents allegedly earned money by making up stories to discredit the war on drugs of the current administration.According to the unpublished book written by an unnamed reporter from Reuters, payment inside fat envoloes were delivered to the journalists who wrote the most discrediting stories about President Rodrigo Duterte.Media outlets who picked up the discrediting stories with unsubstantiated claims allegedly received $50,000 (PHP 2,500,000) from the people who funded the destabilization against President Duterte.A whistleblower journalist who claimed that he cannot live with the lies and deceit anymore revealed some of the informations about the alleged payments received by media outlets to discredit the current administration.Unnamed source also said that the people who funded the discrediting stories about President Duterte’s War On Drugs are likely the people who will benefitted by the failure of the current administration.He also revealed the news organizations,allegedly involved in the orchestrated move to discredit the war on drugs of President Duterte.The source cited four international media companies and two media companies based in the Philippines these are the list:Time Magazine (International)The Washington Post (International)The New York Times (International)The Daily Mail (International)The Inquirer (Local)ABS-CBN (Local)This are the full post wrote by Dan Jimenez:Special Report: Journalists describe lie rewards, made up crime stories in Duterte’s drug war By Dimasalang, Mulawin & Judea Philippine Journalists and foreign correspondents have received cash payments for making up stories and reporting unsubstantiated claims to discredit Duterte’s war on drugs. Detailed in a yet unpublished book written by an unnamed Reuters’ reporter, payments in fat envelopes were delivered almost like clockwork to those who wrote the most outrageous claims. False stories that are picked up by main media outlets and syndicated shows mete the most money to the tune of $50,000 per story at least. The whistle blower journalist confessed that he could not live with the lies and the deceit anymore and that truth which he had sworn to uphold became the first casualty in Duterte’s war on drugs. How prevalent is the payola? Our unnamed source confirmed that there are a lot more money to be had and that news organizations are dipping like crazy into the pot. He cited the competition provided by social media as one of traditional media’s killer, thus the impetus to look for another source of income. Asked who are the financiers in the effort to discredit the war on drugs, he categorically stated, those who will profit from its failure. And that the drug killings attributed to Duterte are the best arguments to oust him whether such can be proven or not. Asked to name the news organizations involved in the orchestrated move to discredit the drug war, he cited Reuters, Time Magazine, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Daily Mail, The Inquirer and ABS-CBN. Attempts to get reactions from the said media outlets remain unanswered as of this writing.Since President Duterte started it’s bloody war on drugs, he was already bombarded by criticisms and negative stories from several media outlets.Supporters of President Duterte attacked the media outlets and accused of being paid by drug lords to write stories against the war on drugs.President Duterte itself criticized two media outlets for writing ‘unfair stories’ about his actions against criminals.",0
"SENATORS on Sunday called on the Duterte administration to observe due process in its war on drugs, saying the rule of law should not be disregarded in the campaign to crush the narcotics trade.President Duterte publicly linked 159 current and former local, military and police officials, lawmakers and judges to illegal drugs early on Sunday and ordered them to turn themselves in for investigation.“Due process has nothing to do with my mouth. There are no proceedings here, no lawyers,” Mr. Duterte said in a predawn speech just before he began naming the suspects.The President, who has led a bloody war on drugs, ordered the security escorts of the suspects withdrawn and canceled their firearm permits. He said they would face sanctions.“If you show the slightest violence in the resistance, I will tell the police, ‘Shoot them,’” Mr. Duterte told reporters and soldiers at Camp Panacan, headquarters of the military’s Eastern Mindanao Command, in Davao City.The President, however, conceded that he “might be wrong” about the guilt of the suspects named on a list distributed to reporters.He said the military and the police had compiled the list, which he insisted was not colored by politics or personal links, adding that some of those named were even his friends.One of the judges on the list has been dead since 2008, an indication that the list is based on old information.‘Name and shame’Commenting on Mr. Duterte’s latest controversial move in the drug war, Sen. Leila de Lima, chair of the Senate committee on justice and human rights, on Sunday warned that the President’s apparent “name and shame” strategy could be seen as hollow if evidence against the suspects were not brought forth before the opening of legal proceedings.De Lima, however, commended Mr. Duterte for having a “strong will and great determination to end the drug problem.”The former justice secretary and human rights chief has been following the drug campaign and is set to lead later this month an inquiry into extrajudicial killings that have come with the fight against narcotics.“To be honest, it’s difficult to pass judgment on the style of the President, especially that a great majority of our people seem to approve of this naming and shaming strategy. If the President thinks it’s an effective strategy, then who are we to dictate to him?” De Lima said.But she emphasized the constitutional requirement of due process.“If there is evidence against these people he has named and shamed, cases should just be filed against them so that warrants for their arrest can be issued. If there is no evidence, then this is a plain and simple witch-hunt,” the senator told the Inquirer.De Lima warned that publicly naming the suspects prior to bringing charges against them in court was tantamount to “a death sentence,” given the President’s shoot-to-kill order against narcopoliticians.“We are already on the slippery slope toward tyranny, without martial law, when we allow one man to be judge, jury and executioner. This is just the start,” De Lima said.“The endgame is just too terrible to imagine, when anyone can be accused and shot on sight based on a list that has the same legal value as a grocery list. I hope this is not what our situation is right now,” she added.Senate President Pro Tempore Franklin Drilon, also a former justice secretary, echoed De Lima’s sentiment, saying “due process and the rule of law must be dutifully upheld.”He said, however, that he strongly supported President Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs.“I urge the President that if there is evidence that these officials are involved in the drug trade, he should immediately charge them administratively or in court. There should be no shortcuts,” Drilon said.Sen. Grace Poe said the administration “must pursue” the drug suspects “with vigor [and] in accordance with the rule of law, until their individual guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt and not let it just remain in the news.”“Everyone, the accuser and the accused, deserves to be given the constitutional right to due process,” Poe said by phone.She said speedy legal proceedings would strongly show that the government could deal with the drug scourge “in accordance with the rule of law.”President cannot be judgeSen. Risa Hontiveros likewise expressed concern about the naming of the suspects publicly, saying “democracy was never about the President’s absolute power to determine innocence or guilt.”“The executive cannot blacken the reputation of people and judge them at will. The responsibility falls upon our judicial system. Sadly, the President’s list, while it may be motivated by good intentions, preempts the court’s judgment and tears at the very fabric of our democracy,” she said.Hontiveros said the public should be given access to information that landed the officials’ names on the President’s list.“The public deserves to know. The government’s war on drugs must be free from the influence of political bias, vendetta and rivalry. Information must be judiciously vetted and not violative of the rule of law,” she said.Sen. Joel Villanueva also hopes to see the administration back up its claims with evidence.“I am hoping and praying that these allegations will be substantiated in the next few days. I think it’s crucial and that cases will also be filed against them and equally important is that they be given their day in court to defend themselves,” he said.Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto said the suspects should be accorded due process.“It is not enough to name and shame them. Guilt must be established through evidence in a trial where the accused can refute the charges,” he said.“The cases must be filed in court because it is the right forum for the government to prove its allegations and those named to present their defense,” he said.Ready to investigateThe Department of the Interior and Local Government said it was ready to investigate the local officials named by Mr. Duterte.“We assure you that the probe will be swift yet fair to the accused,” Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno said in a statement.The Armed Forces of the Philippines said all the military personnel named by Mr. Duterte were considered immediately relieved.Col. Edgard Arevalo, chief of the AFP public affairs office, said the suspects would be charged, heard, and judged under “applicable military, criminal and civil laws.” With reports from Jerome Aning, AP and AFP",1
"No, Bato, shedding tears in public will not solve your problems.A lawmaker on Wednesday told the barrel-chested chief of the Philippine National Police, Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, that crying in Senate hearings would not vanish questions about the suspicious and alarming killings of suspects in President Duterte’s war on drugs.In a statement, Kabayan Rep. Harry Roque said Dela Rosa should instead make public inquest reports on the thousands of suspects killed in police operations, including 17-year-old Kian delos Santos and 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz, whose deaths in the hands of police provoked a public outcry.He noted that under the PNP’s own operations procedure, there should be “no presumption of regularity” in police operations that result in the deaths of suspects.Under Rule 15.4 of the police manual, “inquest is mandatory when a suspect dies during a police operation,” Roque said.“My question to PNP Chief Ronald dela Rosa is, where are the inquest reports of all these deaths?” Roque said. “[These reports] are necessary to remove doubt on any irregularity in police operations in which the death of a suspect happened,” he said.“Crying during hearings will not remove these doubts,” he said.On Tuesday, Dela Rosa broke down as he defended his organization from charges that it was behind the extrajudicial killing of thousands of drug suspects, saying President Duterte never gave him orders to kill.In November last year, the police chief also cried when he appeared at the Senate under similar circumstances.Roque said Dela Rosa should see to it that his men followed the police manual in drug raids, citing the suspicious circumstances in the deaths of Delos Santos and Arnaiz, who were separately gunned down two days apart by police in Caloocan City.“It is alarming when two lives are ended too soon. It is doubly terrifying when these lives were ended by agents of the state,” he said.Police bible“I expect Director General Ronald dela Rosa to order the PNP chain of command to enforce the strict observance of the provisions of the PNP-OP, as this is the police bible for any and all police operations. The families of Kian and Carl, and all the other victims deserve no less,” Roque said.Citing official data from the Philippine Information Agency, he said there were 3,811 deaths in the government’s campaign against narcotics from July 1, 2016, to Aug. 29, 2017.“In fact, in one month—from July 27 to Aug. 29—there have been 360 deaths at the hands of the police. The 3,811 does not even include the homicides with links to illegal drugs,” he said.The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has also asked the PNP to open the investigation reports on those killings.But Dela Rosa told reporters on Monday that he could not release the reports to the CHR without clearance from President Duterte.He said Mr. Duterte had given instructions not to release the investigation reports without his permission.Dela Rosa’s tearful defense of the PNP came after Sen. Risa Hontiveros made the observation that there seemed to be a policy to kill drug suspects in the war on drugs.Talking to reporters later on Tuesday, Mr. Duterte said two deaths, referring to the killings of Delos Santos and Arnaiz, did not mean the government had a policy to kill drug suspects.“She is so stupid,” he said, referring to Hontiveros.President’s words are policyHontiveros responded on Wednesday, saying the deaths of 8,000 to 13,000 suspects in the war on drugs showed there was a policy to kill despite Mr. Duterte’s denial.“I’m not a genius but I know that while two deaths do not make a policy, thousands dead, without remorse, regret or action from the government, do,” Hontiveros said in a statement.“Eight thousand to 13,000 have already died in this bloody war on drugs, mostly from the ranks of the poor,” she added.“President Duterte may insult me but he cannot deny the fact that his words coming from his lips, or those of any head of state, have the effect of policy,” she said, citing Mr. Duterte’s “well-documented record of encouraging violence against drug dependents and suspected drug pushers.”Vice President Leni Robredo joined the fray, calling on the PNP to prove to the people that it does not approve of killing drug suspects.“I think it is the obligation of the police to show the people that they do not sanction these kinds of killings. Whatever they say, if it is contrary to what the people see, the question will always be there,” Robredo said.",1
"The final Philippine Presidential debate was boring. Most of the candidates did not say anything new and significant. Half of the blame should go to the organizers. They should have known not to ask questions that were already asked during the previous debates. The only consolation is that there weren’t a lot of commercials and they did not play an annoying jingle in between breaks.I’m sure most people who were tuned in were waiting for discussions to turn ugly. They were expecting Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte’s rivals to hit him hard over his controversial remarks a week ago about the deceased Australian rape victim. Only Senator Grace Poe brought the matter up and it was obvious that she was stumped by his unapologetic stance. What else can one say when the defense is “I’m just being myself”? Stop being himself too much, I suppose. But that would be too much to ask. It’s like asking someone to change. I don’t think that is possible with Duterte.The only time things started heating up was when Duterte questioned his rival former Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Mar Roxas about the latter’s claim that the current government is already providing PhilHealth coverage to a lot of Filipinos. Duterte disputed Roxas’s claim and said that no one from Davao has received PhilHealth coverage. This was when Roxas lost his cool. Duterte was just trolling him but he didn’t even recognize that was he being trolled in front of national television. Goes to show that Roxas is not very Presidential on account of his inability to read people. Roxas has never been much of a people person.Roxas’s problem is fantasy vesus reality. His claim that the BS Aquino government is already doing so much for the public’s health needs is not evident.Roxas spoke with so much confidence that you could be forgiven for giving him a second look. The problem is, once you start considering why he is very unpopular, you will realize it is due mostly to him being a bad judge of character. He seems to have good ideas, and you wonder why these were never implemented in the first place in the last six years. Considering he is close to President Benigno Simeon Aquino and held powerful positions in his government, it is quite baffling that he failed to make a difference.If we recall, Roxas made a terrible decision in allowing his party mates to push aside his own plans to run for the Presidency in 2010 in order to give way to a more popular candidate whose beloved mother just passed away. He “sacrificed” his own ambition then just so he could please them. I suppose Roxas could not have won over former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada anyway, who came in second during the election, so I guess it wouldn’t have mattered. But, it is the principle. Had he shown conviction then – sticking to his candidacy by running as an independent – the people would have given him more support now.Another problem with Roxas is that, even after he was benched, betrayed, and kept in the dark on some occasions by BS Aquino himself, he is still sticking by Daang Matuwid. He can’t even recognize that the voters are tired of it. He doesn’t even know when to cut his losses. During the debate, Roxas kept giving the current government high marks despite its incompetence and neglect of duties to the public. That is enough reason for voters not to vote for him. While the other candidates are getting points for highlighting the government’s neglect, Roxas has no choice but to stick to praising it. He is stuck between a rock and a hard place because he was part of the government from the very beginning.Duterte, on the other hand, proved once again that he can act civilized and diplomatic when he wants to or when the situation calls for it. One thing is for sure; Duterte knows how to troll people. He can push people’s buttons just like he pushed Roxas’s buttons. Roxas’s reaction says a lot about him. He cannot stay cool when provoked. That is not a good character trait for someone aspiring for the Presidency.Duterte’s simple “How are you?” question was excellent. Without asking Senator Miriam Santiago directly, Duterte managed to get the “iron lady” to talk about her health. He should earn brownie points for that. He also praised Santiago unreservedly, which is also proof that he can be respectful to women and that he recognizes their brilliance.Santiago appeared to be feisty at times but, just the same, appeared to struggle with her thoughts as evident in her long pauses. She says the new cancer pill she has been taking has eliminated the disease and that any talk of her being not healthy enough to survive the presidency is all rubbish. She looked visibly weak though and Vice President Binay highlighted it by coming to her aid every time she had to sit down and get up during the debate.Binay was acting strange as usual. He kept walking around on stage like a game show host. He wanted to give his own Binay touch during the debate. He just looked desperate. He talked mostly about how he was going to give a lot of freebies if he gets elected. Binay even told the fisherman who lost his livelihood that he will be removing the income tax on his earnings so he can save his money. Perhaps later on he will realize how silly it is to remove income tax from someone who doesn’t have a job. One wonders where he is going to get the money for the dole outs after he removes that income tax. He wasn’t specific about how he plans to do it.Binay just had to bring up the issue of Senator Grace Poe’s citizenship. It was lame the way he did it. He wanted to make it look like Poe turned her back on the Philippines when she renounced her citizenship. But considering there are a lot of Filipinos who are overseas who have dual citizenship, his rationale is weak. Besides, Poe’s citizenship issue doesn’t seem to bother the voters, only her rivals.I don’t know about you but I seem to switch off when Grace Poe is the one speaking. Her voice is starting to sound robotic just like her running mate Chiz Escudero. She seemed so rehearsed and we’ve heard all her promises before. I don’t even know why she ran for President to begin with. Her supporters must have told her she should because her father is popular. But she should have been more honest with herself. She’s only new in the Senate and can’t even criticize BS Aquino directly. She’s also into patronage politics and would have to cater to the people who funded her campaign. One of them is king maker and businessman Danding Cojuangco.Frankly, the last debate just gave the candidates an opportunity to grandstand. As usual, they didn’t give specific answers to the questions similar to what they did in the last debates. But even if they did, it’s not a guarantee they can implement their lofty promises. They still have to ask Congress to cooperate and help them achieve these. We all know that’s not going to be easy unless they use pork barrel funds to sweeten deals. This practice has since been deemed illegal due to BS Aquino’s excessive use of it during his term. They will then have to rely on their charms, which some of them don’t have.It is imperative that voters use the election as an opportunity to teach those in power a lesson. The voters should not vote for Liberal Party again.",0
"The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Officer (PCSO) is in hot water for spending millions of pesos for its Christmas Party held recently at the plush Shrangi-la Hotel on EDSA.Newly-appointed PCSO board member Sandra Cam, a.k.a. Whistleblower, was quoted in a report as claiming that the office shelled out P10 million for the party.In reaction to the report, President Rodrigo Duterte said he will not allow extravagance in government.But other officials of the PCSO — General Manager Alexander Balutan and Chairman Jose Jorge Corpuz — said that only P6 million of the original P14 million proposed budget was spent.”Instead of being criticized for spending government funds on a lavish party, the two PCSO officials said their office should be praised and be given a medal for having saved millions of dollars — P8 million to be exact.Moral of the story: you spend some, you save some.",0

Who’s lying?President Benigno Aquino III on Thursday said people know if he or Vice President Jejomar Binay is telling the truth.With some 370 days before his term expires, the President said he was focused on moving the country forward.Though obviously smarting from Binay’s attack on his presidency last Wednesday, Mr. Aquino’s response seemed to be laid-back, calibrated.“My interest is to maximize all the opportunities for our people, to run this country… I have a responsibility to make this society, this country better. I will not allow myself to be distracted by talks of politics when I think it is very clear to the people who is telling the truth, and who is lying,” he told reporters at the Livestock Philippines 2015 Conference.On Wednesday, Binay slammed the Aquino administration’s anticorruption campaign as reeking of “selective justice.” He said the government was insensitive and inept, and specifically referred to allegations of wrongdoing in the disbursement of congressional and executive pork barrel funds, extortion in the mass transport system and the massacre of 44 police commandos in January.READ: Binay calls Aquino admin ‘uncaring,’ ‘blundering’“Enough is enough (tama na, sobra na),” Binay said, borrowing the ringing slogan the President’s mother, the late democracy icon Corazon Aquino, used in the campaign against the dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.“I gave him all the opportunity so that he would not be a spare tire,” Mr. Aquino said, adding he would address “point by point” all the wrongdoing that Binay imputed against the administration. “Maybe you would ask, how do I feel? It’s a given to every Filipino, you put yourselves in my position… I did not treat him wrong and this is what he repays me with? So, I say to him, ‘Thank you.’”READ: Aquino on Binay: I saved him from being spare tireBinay resigned on Monday as presidential adviser on overseas Filipino workers affairs and chief of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council. His daughter, Makati Rep. Abigail Binay, said her father was through being the “punching bag” of Aquino allies seeking higher office, referring to the open-ended hearings in the Senate on corruption allegations against the Vice President and his family and threats to throw them in jail.Dictator’s wrongdoingAsked how he felt that Binay used the ‘Tama na, Sobra na’ battlecry of his mother, Mr. Aquino said: “The people felt the litany of wrongdoing of the dictatorship, all of them were the fault of the dictatorship… When (Binay) sent me his (resignation) letter, I asked him what really was the issue, he couldn’t answer me. So at that point in time, it seems he couldn’t say anything to improve the governance of our country.”Based on Binay’s remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Aquino said, it appeared that the Vice President had “kept to himself so many secrets how to improve the governance of this country.”“I think he has an obligation, as a member of the Cabinet, to share them,” the President said. “If you can do something to improve the lives of the people we promised to serve, why did you keep them secret all this time?”“I was a bit surprised why there was a resignation at this time. So I called him up and eventually we got to talk and I asked him specifically what was the reason? I think the word I used was ‘casus belli’. What was the immediate reason that prompted him to do this action?” Mr. Aquino recalled.“He said there were many and that he would write them down and send them to me. When our conversation ended, I told him, ‘Ok, I will wait for it,’” the President said. “Yesterday, although it was not unexpected, in his statement, he mentioned that he was now the opposition.”“Perhaps this is what politics is in our country. Perhaps he thought, I wouldn’t be endorsing him so he has to show that he doesn’t need my endorsement or he could do better,” Mr. Aquino said.",1
"Manila is absolutely safe from any domestic or international terrorist threats, former president and now mayor of the capital, Joseph Estrada, said yesterday.At the same time, the Department of Tourism (DOT) pushed alternative tourist destinations in the country for those who had scheduled trips in Mindanao, but were forced to cancel them due to the martial law declaration in the region.“Manila is safe, as far as I’m concerned,” said Estrada, dismissing speculations that ISIS has posed a significant threat in the country’s security.At the same time, the Department of Tourism (DOT) pushed alternative tourist destinations in the country for those who had scheduled trips in Mindanao, but were forced to cancel them due to the martial law declaration in the region.Amid the ongoing crisis in Marawi City, the DOT is giving tourists who are scheduled for trips to Mindanao the option to choose from “alternative destinations” that are much safer for travelers, said Tourism Spokesperson Frederick Alegre.“As much as possible, we just want to say that if you have plans [to go to Mindanao], then we can tell you where the alternative destinations are,” said Alegre.But if the tourists really want to visit Mindanao, they have to keep some important things in mind.“First and foremost, siguraduhin na iyong lugar [na pupuntahan] nila [sa Mindanao] ay walang nagaganap na operations, military operations. Pangalawa, always have proper identification with them pagka nasa airport. We also alerted our teams to see all airports and ports para mag-assist sa mga turista, both local and foreign (First and foremost, make sure that there is no military operation going on to the place that you want to visit. Second, always have proper identification with when in the airport. We also alerted our teams to see all airports and ports to assist the tourists, both local and foreign),” Alegre noted.",1
" With no enclosures or fences girding the sprawling 300-hectare farm in this town in Masbate province, Fazenda da Esperança (Farm of Hope) or Fazenda, could be mistaken for a resort, with its cabana-type quarters surrounded by bushes, trees, flowering plants and a manicured lawn.The serene surroundings, however, conceal the farm’s real mission—that of putting order and hope into the turbulent lives of people seeking to stop their addiction to drugs, alcohol, gambling and sex, and the behavioral problems that come with such vices.Established here in 2003, Fazenda originated from Brazil 33 years ago and was inspired by the Focolare Movement to help drug addicts change their ways through work, spirituality and community. Fazenda has since spread in different parts of the world and reached the Philippines via the Masbate facility.The Focolare Movement, founded by Chiara Lubich in 1943 in Italy as a means to survive World War II, promotes the ideals of unity and brotherhood, the same ideals that bind Fazenda residents. Unlike other rehabilitation facilities, the Catholic Church-run Fazenda does not impose restrictive regulations on its residents who are, however, forbidden from keeping and using mobile phones in the farm.The farm in Masbate started with 352 ha of land donated by a Foccolare priest, Fr. Piereno Rogliardi. Since then, Fazenda has transformed 252 hectares of its land into a community with three houses for males under its program; three houses for missionaries, volunteers and sisters, respectively; a beautiful chapel where Mass is held daily as long as a priest is available; a spacious multipurpose hall for various events and an original milking house where neighbors line up early in the morning to buy Fazenda’s most popular product: flavored or unflavored cow’s milk.Suicide attemptsAmong the 32 Masbate residents in the facility is Brandon (surname withheld to protect his privacy), 37, who had attempted suicide thrice while working in the police force, which he joined after quitting a teaching job. The first suicide try left a bullet scar on his skull while blade scars on his wrists are evidence of earlier suicide attempts.Brandon, who is a step away from finishing his yearlong healing program, recalled becoming an alcoholic, suffering from depression, and being suicidal after his girlfriend left him for another man. The emotional roller-coaster led him to self-destruction.His daily regimen of farm work at Fazenda, however, served as therapy, the rush of activities pushing away negative thoughts and energy.Residents in the facility regularly reflect on Biblical passages and Christian teachings to cultivate the pillar of spirituality, Brandon said. “I have learned to make God the center of my life, which I believe would always lead me to do good,” he added.Residents who have finished the program become facilitators who assist and counsel other residents in their activities and tasks. Among them is Dindo, 50, who manages the production of pasteurized milk and mozzarella cheese processed in the farm.The facility also grows organic vegetables that they sell to sustain operations.TemptationGian, 33, said his 10-month stay made him resolute to finish his one-year healing program at Fazenda, despite the persistent temptation to back out during his early months as resident.His addiction to “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) ruined his relationship with his girlfriend and family and burdened his parents, he said, so he decided to enter the facility in June 2016 on his father’s birthday.Things were initially difficult since he was not used to manual work, mused Gian, who used to have a good-paying job in a multinational corporation before he was fired for negligence.He looks forward to finishing the program as a birthday gift to his father on June 25, but he does not intend to leave Masbate to avoid a relapse, he said. “I want to stay in a new place where I can choose new friends and people to deal with,” he added.After a 29-year struggle with drugs, Edward Yosores Jr., 40, has been sober for two years now and was offered a job to administer and manage another Fazenda, a smaller facility in Naga City in Camarines Sur province that operates in a 7-ha farm.The Fazenda in Naga has a maximum capacity of 12 residents and was put up in partnership with the Archdiocese of Caceres.Yosores believes that drug addicts understand themselves better. But it doesn’t hurt to spend at least eight hours on work in the farm, as well as on prayer, reflection and a sharing of experiences while in the facility, he said.Typical scheduleA typical Fazenda schedule starts with waking up at 4 a.m., breakfast at 5:30, meditation and Bible reflections at 6:15, a break at 9, and farm work until 11:45 a.m. Lunch and siesta follow until 2 p.m., after which it’s back to farm work until sundown.Monday nights are devoted to sharing experiences about how they practice the three pillars of Fazenda—work, spirituality and community, while Tuesdays are for catechism. On Wednesday, residents share the “word of life,” a selected passage from the Bible.“For example, if we have chosen ‘act of love,’ a resident can share how he practiced it. A resident may have gathered another resident’s clothes drying in the sun when the rain comes,” Yosores said.Residents do their daily routine on Thursdays, and on Fridays, they watch movies together—usually inspirational films. “But we don’t watch news [programs],” Yosores said.There’s half-day work on Saturdays—and on Sundays, rest and a Mass celebrated together.K, another former addict, heard about Fazenda from another addict and the father of her youngest son.She recalled hitting rock bottom, with only a piece of Spanish bread, an unpaid motel bill, and a cellular phone. She split the bread so she could have it for breakfast and dinner, and left her phone at the motel as collateral for her bill.Finally, with nowhere else to turn to, she returned home: the one place she had been trying to escape through drugs since she was 17. She was 34 then and unwilling to fill the gap she had with her sister and parents.TraumaShe had expected the worst when she returned home in 2014, perhaps a pair of handcuffs and a trip to the rehabilitation center. She was relieved that she was instead brought to Fazenda where the most critical element of rehab is the person’s decision to change. Openness and the willingness to change are key to the person’s successful turnaround, said K who, in over two years, supported her two kids as a writer.Fazenda has changed her, K added. She used to be numb to the hugs of her kids. Today, their hugs delay her from leaving the house, and give her enough reason to hurry home when work is done.At Fazenda, K helps coordinate the weekly meeting of the facility’s graduates. She has become its ambassador of hope.It’s a change that A herself feels despite the trauma of having six of her friends killed in the government’s war on drugs, and of learning about her boyfriend’s murder two days before Christmas. But unlike those who seek retribution for crimes committed against them, A has left everything to God. “God will render judgment on them,” she said.What gives her strength to continue in the program is the desire to prove that authentic change is possible—even for addicts like her who has been using drugs since she was 13. A is now one of two coordinators in the house who makes sure work schedules are followed faithfully and food distributed equitably.In a house where residents deal with painful traumas (including human trafficking, which ultimately led to their drug addiction), the challenges of living together in harmony is a daily struggle. But it is also good training for dealing with the challenges of the outside world.In January, in a Mass celebrated by Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, four more Fazenda graduates became ambassadors of hope. Four may not be an impressive number, but it was a historic moment for the over 100 residents who overcame the logistical challenge of traveling together by bus, boat and van for an 18-hour journey. They were joined by Fazenda founders Fr. Hans Stapel, Nelson Giovanelli, Iraci Leiti and Luci Rosendo, who had flown in from Brazil for a visit.It was a community in solidarity against the extrajudicial killings of drug addicts. Four lives saved against the thousands killed may not seem much, but for Fazenda founders and residents alike, each individual life matters, each a harvest of hope.",1
"Sulu Royal Coffee, an agrarian reform cooperative engaged in producing high quality coffee beans, has received a purchase order from Universal Robina Corp. for 10,000 kilograms, or 10 metric tons, of Robusta coffee bean ‘red pick’.This information was relayed to the Department of Agrarian Reform – Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (DAR-ARMM) by Kumalah ‘Coffee Princess’ Elardo, leader of an agrarian reform beneficiaries’ organization in Panamao, Sulu.Kumalah told DAR-ARMM officials that prior to the placement of the order, Universal Robina’s research group carefully examined the harvest from her group to make sure the Robusta coffee the company would buy is of high quality.The Sulu Royal Coffee beans are produced by the Kandayok Agrarian Reform Community’s (ARC) People’s Alliance for Progress Multi-purpose Cooperative (PAPMPC), which is based in the town of Panamao.The bulk order will represents around 70 percent of the cooperative’s accumulated harvest over four months, Kumalah said.Also under the wings of PAPMPC are Kahawa Sug Royal Coffee, which also produces Robusta, and Kahawa Kubing Royal Coffee, which is roasted civet coffee.These products have received recognition from the international market, especially in Southeast Asian countries.The Sulu Royal Coffee has received recognitions in the past under the leadership of Kumalah. The cooperative abides by its ‘pick red’, or picked ripe, policy in harvesting as well as other disciplined measures to ensure high quality of its produce.The growing coffee industry in Panamao, Sulu has been observed to provide opportunity for the community to be productive.“Dati nagkakabayo lang ang mga farmers, ngayon naka motor na sila… semento na rin ang kanilang mga bahay” (In the past, the farmers rely on horses for transport, now they have motorcycles… also, their houses are now concreted), said Kumalah.",1
"GMA a very hands-on Speaker, says NogralesVilified for wresting the leadership in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has swiftly proven her worth as she helped the 292-member legislative body navigate through issues besetting it, according to Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles.“Based on my experience working with her, she’s very quick in making decisions,” Nograles told an Inquirer forum on Thursday.“When I [consulted her about] a problem with the budget, it took only three minutes for the Speaker to make a decision … She’s really that fast,” he added.Barely two months after unseating President Rodrigo Duterte’s close friend, Davao del Norte Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez, Nograles said the former President had shown the work ethic she was known for during her nine-year stay in Malacañang.Despite her age, he said the 71-year-old Speaker had been attending hearings of various House committees, including the impeachment complaints against Chief Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro and six other Supreme Court justices.“She’s very hardworking,” Nograles said. “I presume that despite her busy schedule, she allocates a certain time to go around the different committees. She would ask what were being discussed by the committees.”",1
"A fuming Barangay Captain personally destroyed the illegal checkpoint built by a certain Jose Palad along the road of Barangay Matictic, Norzagaray Bulacan.Many residence and motorist already complained about the fees that being imposed by Palad along the entrance of Bakas river, a known tourist spot in Barangay Matictic.The lady at the waiting shed allegedly collecting fees from the passing vehicles along Barangay Matictic Photo: Joedell De Castro Francisco.According to some Facebook post from the residence of Norzagaray, the illegal collectors established a checkpoint claiming that the small vehicles wanted to pass the road to Bakas river must pay 30 pesos.The ticket showed that a certain Jose Palad claimed that he owned the road to the tourist spot.The ticket given by the illegal collectors to the vehicles.

Mabuhay ka po.” Raquel Rodriguez said.But several netizens also questioned the move of the Barangay Captain saying that its only a publicity stunt.“Kaso sir bkit kung kelan malapit na eleksyon saka lang naaksyonan, 2013 pa pala me permit yn at ikaw pa nkapirma tanong lng kap???” Netizen Jeffrey Veluz said.Two days before Captain Abba Palad took action against the illegal collectors, netizen Joedell De Castro Francisco posted his complaint about the fees collected along Barangay Matictic.The post went viral on the internet, reaching 1,000 shares from the members of Santa Maria Bulacan Facebook group.“May naniningil parin ng RIGHT OF WAY sa norzagaray, papuntang bakas .

"Philippine Department of Justice Secretary (DOJ) Secretary Leila de Lima is facing the toughest times of her career as a public official.As DOJ secretary, she is heading up the investigation of the 10 Billion-peso pork barrel scam that has implicated senators, congressmen, administration officials, the Catholic Church and even her own department. The scam involved an elaborate scheme to siphon taxpayer funds into phony nongovernmental organizations and projects as well as into the pockets of government officials.But she is also facing a tough confirmation process before the Commission on Appointments.Among many others, the president of the Whistleblowers Association of the Philippines, Sandra Cam, is opposing de Lima’s confirmation as DOJ secretary. Cam has accused de Lima of engaging in “illicit affairs” and claims to have a video tape of de Lima having sex with men, including her personal driver. While de Lima’s marriage has been annulled, Cam says that the secretary’s affairs involved married men. Cam has not publicly released the alleged videotape.In countering the allegations, de Lima questioned the motives and credibility of Cam, saying that the whistleblower must be harboring lots of lice in her head. Asked by reporters if she meant “lies,” de Lima made it clear she meant “lice,” adding that Cam is just jealous because she can’t get men to have sex with her because of her head lice. “I mean, come on, who would ever want to have sex with a woman with lice,” de Lima said.Already, many netizens are calling this rivalry between the two women “the battle of the gross!”",0
"Filipinos have gone through adversities in recent months, but Easter, the celebration of Christ’s resurrection, offers them hope and joy.“Remember Yolanda. Remember Mamasapano. Remember the frustrating unsolved problem of government corruption. Remember the loneliness of our loved ones toiling abroad. Our memory is full of broken hopes and dreams. The litany of frustrations is endless. But we have hope,” Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, says in an Easter message that he will deliver at the Cathedral of Saint John the Evangelist in Dagupan City today.“Easter is the greatest and most important feast of our faith. If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is irrelevant and meaningless, dry and dead,” Villegas says.He calls on the faithful to “go beyond the customary greetings and feasting” and continue the mission of the Risen Christ by bringing His message to more people.“Be like the Risen Jesus. Look at the Risen Jesus. Love the Risen Jesus. Follow the Risen Jesus. What is it in Jesus that we must carry with [us] through life?

"Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV on Thursday threatened to sue the head of the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) for allegedly “covering up” President Duterte’s bank records.In a statement, Trillanes said AMLC Executive Director Mel Georgie Racela had denied that the flagged bank transaction documents of Mr. Duterte came from the council when minutes of its meeting in May 2016 showed that it must provide the Office of Ombudsman the documents “for intelligence purposes.”The senator said the sharing of documents was part of the memorandum of agreement between the two agencies.Trillanes noted that Mr. Duterte appointed Racela to the AMLC post only in January 2017 so that the start of his term “doesn’t cover that time [the AMLC meeting in 2016].”Last year, the AMLC rejected Trillanes’ request to release the President’s alleged “flagged or reported” bank transactions as this would violate the Bank Secrecy Law.Trillanes disclosed his plan to sue the AMLC chief as he expressed full support for Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales’ decision not to enforce Malacañang’s suspension order against Overall Deputy Ombudsman Melchor Arthur Carandang.The Palace accused Carandang of disclosing the President’s alleged bank records.“Mr. Duterte is very wrong here,” Trillanes said. “Besides the fact that the Ombudsman and her deputies are independent, according to the Constitution, he suspended those investigating his stolen wealth. It’s clear that this is obstruction of justice.”",1
"There’s a common trait shared by some of the critics of US president Donald Trump and Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte that drives even the most rational supporters of both presidents into near-fanatic levels in defending their chosen candidate.The supposed supporters of “modern liberal thinking”, the antithesis of the “backward and barbaric” maxims supposedly espoused by the likes of these two recently-elected presidents, have tirelessly beat down and consistently displayed their disgust on everything they and their supporters have done as early as the campaign period, all the way to being sworn into office.For sexist remarks, gutter-mouthed orations, to racist and homophobic slurs, these polarizing characters have singlehandedly demolished political correctness without even trying. And that, as far as the champions of good behavior and crusaders of morality and everything good, is downright unforgivable.To the arbiters of so-called progressive thinking, support for the two controversial presidents and everything they stand for is the equivalent of an intellectual and moral lobotomy: There’s just no way an intelligent, morally upright person would support anything so ‘dumb’, crass, and given to outbursts unbecoming of a ‘statesman’.Therefore—whether it’s implied or stated bluntly—if you support these two in any way, you must be a racist, homophobic, bloodthirsty war-monger who does not know what he’s doing and who can’t see the possible ramifications of his ‘reactionary‘ vote.That about right?In the Philippines there’s a significant number of people comprising a small, but perpetually annoying group that think in terms of how things should be rather than adapt and work with what’s available because of how things are. Lovingly called The Yellows—named after the banner color of the Aquino Clan after the 1986 EDSA Revolution—they also branded themselves and their cause ‘disente’ (decent) as early as the campaign period as a counterpoint for Mar Roxas against the popular, but foul-mouthed Duterte.The Yellows, along with a small group of other dissenters who do not necessarily view the Aquinos as patron saints, have taken to the streets to voice their disapproval of controversial initiatives of the administration like the war on drugs and the Marcos burial. Some even matched the president’s penchant for hyperbole by declaring the Philippines is in the early stages of the apocalypse.What these people who insist on lofty principles (like the overused and abused term justice) seem to have forgotten is that the very entities they keep on demanding their government to provide have been already missing in the Philippines for a long time. And that these concepts seem to work only for a few privileged and moneyed families; and are all but alien to the average Pinoy trying to make ends meet on a daily basis.Where democratic institutions and concepts that are supposed to be in service of the people have been turned into mere abstractions with no real meaning or bearing in reality: ‘Law enforcement’, ‘justice’, ‘public services’, and even HUMAN RIGHTS have turned into vestigial extensions of politicians’ by-the-numbers-speeches that do not resonate in any way and leave any lasting impression to the general population.Which is not to say that all those ideals should not be upheld. There is a general perception among the critics of the present administration that it shuns these principles for shortcut methods to achieve maximum results in the smallest possible time frame. Lots of arguable points there from, moral, ethical and humanist perspectives. No question there.However, as what GRP has been asserting since its inception, government is simply the product of the culture that spawned it. And that Philippine culture is the main culprit.Because despite all the posturings to the contrary, the Philippines really is an inherently unjust and backward society beset with a troubling case of tribalism and acute clannish mentality that takes precedence over anything. In his article The Philippines: An inherently unjust society where criminals big and small get away GRP webmaster benign0 condensed that very sentiment about Philippine government in a very simple, but confronting question:In the Philippines, is there anyone in the government one can run to who could assure us that the best efforts will be taken and the latest facilities employed to get the job done?Given such a bleak scenario and a shortage of real action from institutions that are supposed to protect and render service for the average taxpayer, it is hardly surprising why the likes of Duterte’s brand of instant (allegedly) “vigilante” justice gained a strong foothold in a society that, as expected, thrives on doing things in a shortcut manner. Hence, the pwede na expression that, unfortunately, is still the norm in the nation. Just take a look at the candidates during the last presidential election and you can clearly see who stood out by packaging himself as a catalyst that would get the country out of its rut.As many political analysts in the Philippines have repeatedly said, a good number of voters have been fed up by the same ineffectual and flat-lining brand of management Metro Manila TRAPOS have been subjecting the entire nation for years. The small ‘Bisaya’ mayor was everything the old guard were not.It is perhaps the scathing video commentary of British news personality Jonathan Pie that best describes the same phenomenon when Trump won:“Most people didn’t vote for her, not because she’s a woman, they didn’t vote for her because she offered no palpable change whatsoever. Same old shit. Trump represents a change, a terrifying change, but a change nonetheless.”I totally get the outrage, because that’s exactly how I would probably react had the tables been turned and the person I supported was beaten by the one I would like the most to lose. And now, rumors of self-styled ‘patriot’ Loida Nicolas Lewis spearheading an Oust Duterte! movement had been circulating in both traditional and social media lately. The dissenters have apparently found their beacon of hope in her and Leni Robredo. All under the pretense of ‘saving’ the Philippines from a raving maniac.You don’t like Duterte, fine. You hate his mannerisms and policies, fine. You’d rather have pristine, sweet-talking, politically-correct, thieving dipshits endorsed by the equally corrupt CBCP; that’s fine, too. To each his pawn in the never-ending powerplay that is politics.But kindly drop the ‘moral’ and ‘decent’ bullcrap. We’re all Pinoys here, and you’re not fooling anyone.",0
"Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism,” Pope Francis told an Italian guild of national journalists Thursday.The pope said that spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.”Reacting to the pope’s statement, a coalition of biased Philippine media issued a joint statement criticizing the head of the Roman Catholic Church. The coalition members include ABS-CBN, GMA-7, Rappler and the Philippines Daily Inquirer.In its statement, the coalition admonished Pope Francis, saying that “The Vatican should not be meddling in internal affairs of the Philippines and its media. Does the Holy Father know about separation of church and state?”The concerned media organizations denied they were “terrorists.” “We only report what we see with our own yellow eyes,” they said.In addition to the news media, some netizens signed the statement, including Raissa Robles, Jim Paredes, Leah Navarro, Carlos Celdran and Cynthia Patag.",0
"Illegal gambling operations in various part of the country have taken a toll on the earnings of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office that would have been used to help provided medical assistance to Filipinos, according to PCSO Chairman Jose Jorge Corpuz.He said the PCSO is losing 30 percent of its potential income from Small Town Lottery (STL) to illegal gambling.Corpuz said authorized agent corporations (AACs) are having difficulty meeting their presumptive monthly retail receipts (PMRR) obligations, thus affecting government revenues.During a Senate hearing last Tuesday on the proposed creation of the Philippine Charity Office (PCO), some AACs complained that illegal gambling continues to flourish in their areas of operation preventing them from fully meeting their obligations to the government.There are 72 AACs currently operating all over the country that provided a revenue increase for PCSO amounting to P8.8 billion from January to August.One of the AACs, Ramloid Corp., which operates in Laguna, which reported that it is only collecting P4 million daily from STL operation because about P1.2 million was lost to illegal gambling.Lucky V Prime Enterprises Corp., an AAC from Albay, is supposed to remit to PCSO P2.5 million daily but only managed to meet 70 percent of its PMMR in August, also because of the continuous operation of illegal gambling in its area of operation.Similar cases have been reported in the provinces of Batangas, Bulacan, Negros Occidental and Pangasinan.The continued operation of illegal gambling was raised earlier by PCSO General Manager Alexander Balutan who called on Philippine National Police leadership to address the issue.“We have to face the illegal gambling crisis, and double our efforts in the conduct of operations against illegal gambling to arrest syndicates, particularly those who are using STL as a front to cover their illegal business,” Balutan said.He said legitimate STL collectors should be arrested if they ran illegal bookies in their areas of operation.“The PCSO, together with our STL AACs hopes to finally eradicate the jueteng, which seems to be the biggest challenge of STL operations,” Balutan added.",1
"The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump has extended an invitation to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to visit the U.S. so that both leaders can personally discuss the importance of U.S.-Philippines ties.The invitation was extended during a “very friendly” phone call between the two leaders this weekend.Trump suggested that Duterte contact the U.S. Embassy in Manila to start the application process for his visa to visit the U.S. (Filipinos need a visa to visit America.)It will be recalled that Duterte had said that he was once denied a visa to visit his girlfriend in the U.S. back when he was in college. But now that he is president, the chances of his being granted a visa is better than 99%.Trump, on the other hand, is expected to visit the Philippines in November this year to attend the East Asia Summit.While U.S. citizens are not required to secure a visa to visit the Philippines, Duterte hinted that there might be a change in immigration policy, thereby requiring Trump to secure a Philippine visa when he visits in November.“Unless, of course, Trump decides to include the Philippines 🇵🇭 in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program which would exempt Filipinos from securing a visitor’s visa to enter the U.S.,” Duterte said.",0
"Anyone who has watched the 2016 presidential campaign knows by now that President-elect Rodrigo Duterte does not like wearing suits, or the barong tagalog. His preference has always been his trademark red, black and white checkered polo shirt.It goes without saying that the Filipinos are quite curious about what Duterte is going to wear when he takes his oath of office at noon on June 30, 2016.No surprises there.Duterte will still wear his favorite checkered shirt under a reddish-brown leather jacket — an attire that symbolizes both his simplicity and toughness. He will also wear a fedora.Today, the Duterte transition committee unveiled the design of Duterte’s inaugural attire, modeled by no less than Filipino American singer Bruno Mars.The inaugural attire was designed by Colombian designer Alfredo Barraza. Yes, the same Barraza who designed the national costume of Miss Philippines MJ Lastimosa during the 2015 Miss Universe Pageant.Duterte seemed to like the design, except that he was furious Mars was photographed holding a cigarette.

"Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon denounced the circulation of a photo on social media that showed him in the company of the owner of the warehouse where P6.4 billion worth of “shabu” (crystal meth) was seized.In a statement, Faeldon said the photo maliciously implied that it was taken before the raid was conducted by Bureau of Customs operatives on May 26.“Raw photos of the raid from the Office of the Commissioner indicated that a similar photo was indeed taken on the day Hongfei Logistics warehouse in Valenzuela was raided,” he said.Faeldon said he reluctantly agreed to the request of Richard Chen, the warehouse owner, to have a photo with him out of courtesy.“This attempt to link me [to] the apprehended shabu is outrageous. The photos themselves will prove that I met Mr. Chen only on the day of the raid itself,” he said.“The people behind this malicious attack only proved that I had crossed big names in the illegal drug trade. However, this will not slow down our fight against drugs,” he said.",1
"GOVERNANCE MATTERSBy JEJOMAR C. BINAYFormer Vice PresidentAN online media report, citing data from the Philippine National Police (PNP), claimed that 23,518 Homicide Cases Under Investigation (HCUI) have been recorded from July 1, 2016, up to June 11, 2018. The figure, the report said, is equivalent to “an average of 33 people killed a day.”Excluded from the tally, said the report, are 4,279 persons killed in anti-drug operations. These are suspected drug pushers in poor communities, described in police reports and in the news as “nanlaban.” News reports usually show guns, mostly rusty .38s, next to the lifeless bodies as proof of “resisting” legitimate police operations.The report, if accurate, is disturbing. It contradicts repeated assurances from the Philippine National Police (PNP) that our communities are safer.Even the President has acknowledged the rising criminality. In a speech immediately after returning from South Korea, he spoke strongly of using “emergency powers” to address concerns over an upsurge in crime incidents.What prompted the renewed focus on criminality? It seems that South Korean businessmen told the President they were holding off investments “for fear of being kidnapped or killed.”Apparently, the kidnapping and killing of a South Korean businessman by no less than members of the PNP has shaken investor confidence.The situation is indeed problematic for the administration. It came to power in 2016 on a single platform of addressing criminality, particularly the drug menace. Criminality, it maintained during the campaign, feeds people’s insecurity and alienates government from the people.More importantly, the administration emphasized a link between the economy and peace and order. Investors will not put their money in a country where they do not feel safe.Yet, that is precisely what is happening now.Normally, a stern message from the President would be enough to energize law enforcers. Yet just a few days after the President made the remark, a Catholic priest, Fr. Richmond Nilo, was gunned down while officiating mass inside a chapel. With this brazen act, criminals seem to be taunting the determination of the leadership.Father Nilo was the third priest to be killed since December last year. Judges, prosecutors, journalists, and a former mayor and congressman were also killed in the past few months. Primetime television news is cluttered with reports on drugs, crime, killings, and shootouts, reinforcing the perception that peace and order has taken a turn for the worst.The burden falls on the PNP to take decisive action and address these killings. Malacanang has made it known that it wants these killings resolved. Note, however, that such admonition is now customary, issued each time a high-profile killing is reported.What concerns me, and I am certain I am not the only one, is the brazen manner in which the killers committed these high-profile killings. If makes me reflect if there are other factors at play.Is it, as Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas claimed, because of “verbal persecution?”In a statement issued with other church leaders after Father Rio’s killing, the archbishop urged an end to the “verbal persecution of the Catholic Church because such attacks can wittingly embolden more crimes against priests.”We should take time to ponder over the statement of the archbishop.We have lost, it seems, the capacity for civil discourse, the tolerance for divergent views that is the bedrock of a democratic nation. Verbal attacks on some sectors, among them priests and journalists, have been consistent for the past two years. As consistent and as predictable to some are the physical attacks that come after. Of late, the lowly “tambays” have been shamed publicly and online. We dare not imagine what would follow.But let me stress that it is not only the administration and its supporters who resort to slander, threats, and shaming. Administration critics are as guilty in perpetuating a culture of intolerance and hate, especially on social media.Yet it falls on those in power to wield its authority to promote decency, tolerance and unity. There will always be critics, but those who wield power must be reminded that a democracy demands not just tolerance for opposing views but encouraging citizens to freely express their thoughts and ideas.Power should not be wielded to foment hate and division, but to promote peace and unity. It must encourage respect for the law, not unlawful acts. Rule of law, not rule by law.jcbinay11@gmail.com",1
"Less than a week into her new job, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat admits to being overwhelmed by the number of what she describes as irregularities in the projects promoted by the previous leadership at the Department of Tourism (DOT).Puyat was so appalled at the level of corruption that she teared up during a television interview on ABS-CBN on Friday night while talking about the misuse of DOT funds.“It’s so shocking because I’m discovering something new every day. And it’s saddening because large sums of money are involved here. Not just P1 million or P2 million, but hundreds of millions,” she said.The secretary has ordered the suspension of all DOT projects pending the results of a review by the Commission on Audit (COA).In a May 17 letter to COA Chair Michael Aguinaldo, Puyat asked for an audit of “all ongoing and pending” programs of the DOT and its agencies, such as the Tourism Promotions Board (TPB).It breaks her heart that some DOT officials are involved in the fund mess while poor farmers continue to suffer, said Puyat, an undersecretary at the Department of Agriculture before President Duterte appointed her to head the DOT.Among the contracts she has put on hold is the “Buhay Carinderia” of the TPB, whose chief operating officer, Cesar Montano, already paid P80 million to the project organizer even before the video series on Filipino street food and eateries had aired.Montano, however, washed his hands of the deal and instead pointed to Wanda Tulfo-Teo—“my boss",1
"Antibiotics face a test from the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, according to World Health Organization (WHO) country representative Gundo Weiler.“The ability to fight infections with drugs is one of the most important achievement[s] that we often take for granted but today we are at risk of losing this achievement because of Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR),” Weiler said on Tuesday during the celebration of Philippine Antibiotic Awareness Week at Waterfront Manila Pavilion Hotel.Weiler added that an estimated 700,000 deaths worldwide resulted from infections caused by AMR and it is predicted to increase to 10 million by 2050.He said he considers AMR as one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development.It will also affect the economy worldwide with losses amounting to $100 trillion, Weiler added.Misuse of antibiotics is the leading cause of AMR, the ability of bacteria to be resistant to treatment using antibiotics.One reason is the confusion of the public that treats antibiotics as vitamins, Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial said.“Antibiotics should be used to treat bacterial infections only when prescribed by a certified health professional,” Weiler said.Monitoring and controlling the use of antibiotics is difficult because pharmacies and drugstores do not observe the law requiring a doctor’s prescription before antibiotics can be procured.Another misuse of antibiotics is shortening treatment using these substances.“The full course of treatment must be completed, not saved for the future,” Weiler said.Ubial cited a required period of intake for antibiotics.The Department of Health has partnered with the World Health Organization to combat the increasing instances of AMR through launching of three operational tools to guide health professionals in their prescription of antibiotics.These tools–AMS Manual of Procedures, National Antibiotic Guidelines and Anti-Microbial Consumption Methods Guide–signal the start of PAAW’s Anti-Microbial Stewardship (AMS) program to address the misuse of antibiotics.Ubial said the Health department is advocating a stop to medical missions, which cause AMR.Around 90 percent of those who benefit from medical missions pretend to be sick to get free drugs, she added.Instead, she encouraged the public to seek consultation when sick.“What we want to do is to strengthen the routine health care delivery system so that when people get sick they have the available drugs and the available professionals,” Ubial said.Meanwhile, surveillance conducted by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine continues to provide data that could serve as guide to health professionals on what antibiotics to prescribe, RITM’s Celia Carlos said.“Without those important surveillance data, we can never be sure what works and what does not work,” Carlos added.",1

"The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) of the Department of Homeland Security has just released the revised test questionnaire for immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship.It is a far cry from the 100 potential questions that an immigration officer might ask a citizenship applicant.

"MILITANT teachers’ group Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) on Satur­day hit Education Secretary Leonor Briones for siding with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) in denying teachers local allowances and additional school supplies.“Secretary Briones’ response letter dated June 20, 2017 to ACT proves that she has no heart for the teacher’s rights and welfare. She reiterated her insensitive statement that teachers are well compensated and shall not receive local allowances and additional chalk/teaching supplies allowances,” Benjamin Valbuena, the group’s national chairperson, said.The group claimed the DepEd chief has defended the imposition of the DepEd-DBM-DILG Joint Circular No. 1 Series of 2017 that prohibits the use of Special Education Fund for teachers’ local allowance. Teachers are also asking for an increase in chalk/teaching supplies allowance from P2,500 to P5,000.“Instead of protecting our rights and welfare, the Secretary of Education is the first to deny these to us eventually contributing to the teachers’ poor economic situation and sacrifices under the rotting K-to-12 education system. Given the secretary’s inutility, the teachers and education sector as a whole will eventually continue the intensifying call for just and decent pay and benefits,” Valbuena said.According to Valbuena, public school teachers are actually underpaid and receive meager salary. Based on the computation presented by Department of Education (DepEd), entry level teachers enjoy an aggregated monthly compensation of P24,399.40. This includes basic pay, personal economic relief allowance and the subsidy for personnel benefit contributions like Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).“Contrary to DepEd’s computation, teachers who are working more than six hours in school pay taxes, contributions to GSIS, Pag-IBIG [Home Mutual Development Fund] and PhilHealth have a maximum take home pay of P16,000. The said amount is far from the amount suggested by IBON Foundation and daily cost of living in the National Capital Region and nearby regions,” he said.“The family living wage in the National Capital Region, is estimated at P1,119 per day or more than P33,570 per month to sustain a family with six members. This situation will push teachers to borrow from government financial institutions, or even to unregistered loan sharks in order to cope with this living salary gap,” Valbuena added.The teacher’s group said that adding to Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno’s deceptive computation, Briones also computed teachers’ monthly salary by adding the mid-year bonus, year-end bonus, clothing allowance, productivity enhancement incentive and cash gifts to teachers’ annual pay divided into 12 months. The computation indicates those with rank of Teacher 1 receives P27,000 per month as entry level pay.“While it is true that teachers receive mid-year bonus, year-end bonus, clothing allowance, productivity enhancement incentive and cash gifts, it is the government’s responsibility to give such. These benefits shall not be included in computing the monthly salary of teachers because these benefits are temporary and excluded in the computation for retirement pension of teachers,” he said.",1
"Many years ago during President Gloria Arroyo’s first term, a mining conference was held in Metro Manila. The former president proudly declared that the Philippines was on the threshold of becoming one of the ten largest “mining powers” in the world, and because of a reinvigorated mining industry, our country was on the verge of an economic takeoff like never before. To end her keynote speech, the former president exclaimed, “We should not be poor!”Remarkably, when the then president was addressing those 300 hundred delegates, representing 7 countries, who attended that mining conference, the Philippines had already given 40 percent of its territory as concessions to multinational mining companies. Yet, poverty was still a principal concern, as it was during the watch of Presidents Corazon Aquino, Fidel Ramos, and Joseph Estrada. What could have gone wrong? Why didn’t mining eradicate poverty and bring about prosperity as promised?The newly appointed secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources was the ineffable Michael Defensor, rapidly confirmed by the Commission on Appointments, unlike the combative Gina Lopez. At that same conference, he jubilantly revealed that the top 23 mining companies and the 37 exploration projects were expected to generate US$ 5 to 7 billion in new investments, in the next five years, which meant the government would earn at least P100 billion a year in taxes. He bragged that the Arroyo administration would not only wipe out the country’s fiscal deficit, but also and more importantly, put an end to the curse of chronic poverty.Also present at that conference was the debonair Ignacio Bunye, presidential press secretary and spokesman, who assured one and all that safeguards and safety nets had been incorporated in the mining plans to protect the rights of “affected communities.” I felt that he was anticipating violent objections from environmentalists and civic action groups.How blessed we are; we have been sitting on tons of gold, silver, zinc, copper, nickel, cobalt, not to mention natural gas, heavy water, oil, semi-precious stones like agates and jades. However, exploiting these precious natural resources has been deadly and devastating not only for those communities living around the mining areas but also for the environment in general. The example that refuses to be forgotten is Marinduque, an island of Region IV-B’s Mimaropa, with an area of 959 sq. kilometers and a manageable population of less than 300,000. Marcopper conducted mining operations there for 20 years with no safeguards at all. As a result, the rivers and waterways and farmlands in Marinduque have been poisoned beyond salvation. The incidence of poverty was recorded at 71.9 per cent. In like manner, the riverside dwellers of Bataraza, Palawan, the Subanons of southwestern Minadanao, the Mangyans of Mindoro Oriental, the Tagbanuas, B’laans, Batak, Cordillerans, and Tau’t Bato are today not a centavo richer because of broken promises of mining companies.During that conference, the “International Business News” published a glowing report about the Philippines having an estimated US$ 1 trillion in unexplored mine wealth which, if properly exploited can generate as much as US$ 3 billion in annual gross sales and P500 million in yearly taxes for the government. Will someone please check out those figures and the predicament of the above-mentioned communities? We have to know if those promises made before an international audience were ever fulfilled.More than a decade ago, supposedly on the threshold of mining boom, President G. Arroyo declared, “We should not be poor!”(ggc1898@gmail.com)",1
"Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales will “not enforce” what she calls Malacañang’s “patently unconstitutional” suspension of Overall Deputy Ombudsman Melchor Arthur Carandang, denouncing the Palace move as a “clear affront” to her office and the Supreme Court.Breaking her silence two days after the Office of the President’s order was announced on Monday, Morales said “the recent spate of events poses a great cause for concern.”She said the Palace action “was not an inadvertent error but a clear affront to the Supreme Court and an impairment of the constitutionally enshrined independence of the Office of the Ombudsman.”She also called out the Office of the President (OP) for its “arbitrary disregard of a clearly worded jurisprudence coupled with a confident stance that it will be changed.”The OP suspended Carandang for 90 days after charging him with three administrative offenses for allegedly disclosing President Duterte’s alleged bank records.Supreme Court rulingThe move is controversial because the Supreme Court in a Jan. 28, 2014, ruling declared unconstitutional the Ombudsman Act’s provision that gave the OP disciplinary powers over the government watchdog’s deputies.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said on Monday that the OP was “confident” that the Supreme Court would “reverse” its pronouncement in Carandang’s case.Still, Morales said “the Ombudsman will … not allow herself to betray her sworn duty to uphold the Constitution by recognizing what is patently unconstitutional as ordained by the Supreme Court …”“The Ombudsman cannot … seriously place at risk the independence of the very office [that] she has pledged to protect on the strength of the constitutional guarantees which the high court has upheld,” she said.This was the first time Morales issued a substantive press statement in four months, as she had lain low after Mr. Duterte threatened to have her impeached.Impeachment threatThe President made the threat in the wake of Morales’ refusal to back down on her agency’s probe of Mr. Duterte and his family’s bank transactions before he won the presidency.Malacañang earlier accused the Ombudsman of being part of a plot to oust the President.Mr. Duterte’s attacks on Morales last year came after Carandang disclosed to a media group that he had in his custody “more or less” the same bank documents that Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV had used to support his plunder allegations against the President.Carandang is spearheading the investigation into Mr. Duterte’s alleged unexplained wealth, as Morales has inhibited herself from proceedings against him since she is the aunt of his son-in-law, lawyer Manases Carpio.The furious President said on Oct. 2 that the Office of the Ombudsman’s bank documents were “illegally obtained” and said it “held evidence that they took without the permission” of the Anti-Money Laundering Council.Mr. Duterte said the Ombudsman should have secured first a court order to make its possession of his bank transaction documents legal.Then, on Oct. 4, Mr. Duterte claimed that his alleged bank records came from “a certain Abad who is [the] mistress” of Trillanes. The President reportedly referred to former AMLC Executive Director Julia Baccay-Abad.2006-2015 transactionsA month before the presidential election in 2016, the senator furnished the documents showing Mr. Duterte had transactions amounting to at least P2 billion in several bank accounts in the country.From 2006 to 2015, Mr. Duterte held seven joint accounts with his daughter Sara at Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) branch on Julia Vargas Avenue in Pasig City, nine joint accounts at BPI Edsa Greenhills branch, and one joint account at Banco de Oro branch in Davao City.Mr. Duterte, according to Trillanes, did not declare at least P227 million at BPI Julia Vargas in his 2014 statement of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALN).In his 2014 SALN, Mr. Duterte reported a net worth of P21.97 million. He also reported cash assets worth P13.84 million, but he did not disclose how and when he acquired these.Mr. Duterte initially denied the existence of the bank account at BPI branch on Julia Vargas Avenue in Pasig but later admitted that it had less than P200 million.He said he did not declare the big amount in his SALN in 2014 because he had already spent it. He said the money came from friends as a birthday gift.‘Not ironclad’Sought for comment, lawyer Manuelito Luna, who initiated the complaint against Carandang in October last year, claimed Carandang “can now be bodily thrown out of his office” by the police “and Morales cannot do anything about it.”Luna said the 2014 Supreme Court ruling should be disregarded, claiming it was “not ironclad and doctrinal” because it was reached through a split vote of 8-7.This prompted ACT Teachers Rep. Antonio Tinio to call on the Ombudsman to “vigorously defend itself from yet another attempt by the Duterte administration to weaken institutional checks on graft, corruption and abuse of power in government.”",1
"As many Philippine History teachers and Rizalistas will attest to, the 19th Century writings of “national hero” Jose Rizal still resonate strongly today in the 21st Century. If true that in more than a century, the Philippines has hardly changed, then, indeed, the confronting question is raised: How much change could any one president actually implement in the Philippines over six years?For that matter, do presidents really matter?Because cult of personality rules in the Philippines and trumps ascendancy of ideas in a any “debate”, presidents will always be perceived to matter. Indeed, many in the current Opposition now call for loyalty to country and not to personalities. They, particularly those in the “Yellow camp”, of course conveniently forget that the heyday of their domination over Philippine politics was propped up by cults of “heroic” personalities of 1980s yore.Indeed, the very failure of the Opposition to unite against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who continues to enjoy immense popularity and the political capital that goes with it is a result of their blind rallying around “vice president” Leni Robredo. Robredo, as we now know turned out to be a sad non-threat and, ultimately, a non-issue to the incumbent administration. She was easily defanged then sidelined from Duterte’s Malacanang court and, thanks to a series of communication and public relations gaffes, degenerated into a political laughingstock.The Opposition had, in essence, become a victim of their own blind beholdenness to cult of personality.The important lesson to learn here is that the irrational loyalty to Aquino “heroes” and the Yellow brand created around them that imprisons many members of today’s Opposition was forged amidst the popular euphoria of the 1980s when their political capital was at its peak. Duterte is currently at a similar peak and, armed with this important hindsight, Duterte’s followers will need to decide whether or not the lessons the Yellow Camp failed to learn are worth heeding.Duterte’s handlers — specially those at the front-lines of his social media PR machine — need to collectively mature from being a cult of personality to being true thought leaders — the kind that the wannabes in the Opposition camp’s own PR machine (one dominated by a certain “social news network”) failed to become.The rare opportunity at stake here is that Duterte, more than any of his predecessors, is a president that actually matters. Rather than settle into the persistent status quo that kept the Philippines’ social structure paralysed under the thumb of an entrenched — and, in some cases, criminal — oligarchy and feudal class, Duterte set out to rock the boat. While previous presidents pretended to regard their constituents as “the boss”, the Duterte administration is evidently guided by what is relevant to ordinary Filipinos.Duterte is guided by ordinary Filipinos.Because he actually is, it therefore becomes more important that this guidance come increasingly from a more mature constituency. This is where real thought leadership comes into play. It should evolve from one defined by loyalty to a person to one defined by direction framed by the campaign promises of Duterte that won him the presidency.Duterte himself always emphasises the importance of momentum independent of his person. It is evident in his rather morbid obsession with the possibility of his own death whilst in the service of his country. The inadvertent message there is that Duterte himself sees the direction he is steering the country towards as one that needs to outlast his presidency. As such, the messaging used to rally his supporters needs to evolve towards emphasising this direction and less on building loyalty. Framed this way, the trite style of “trolling” sustained by the Opposition focusing on vilifying Duterte will be rendered obsolete.More importanly, the violence surrounding the “war on drugs” that put the Philippines on the map for the wrong reasons will be given better context. When focus shifts more on the reality of how crime and crime personalities remained entrenched and untouchable for many decades until now, the message will be sent across that changing such a deep-rooted status quo will be necessarily violent — that the situation attracted the action. At the moment, much of the flawed reasoning underpinning Duterte’s critics’ shrill cries of bloody murder is around vilifying him for pushing this “violence” onto Philippine society when all evidence shows that it was the situation on the ground that pulled that violence in.Today’s crop of administration-allied influencers need to become more clever that way — better at framing the message and better at changing the obsolete loyalty-based approach that Opposition “thought leaders” are currently fixated to. When the direction change is taking is systematically decoupled from the leader who did the initial steering, that change could be sustained over the long term. That is the challenge — a challenge bigger than merely sustaining Duterte’s popularity.",0

"Amid rapid-fire questioning by Senator Bongbong Marcos, the general manager of the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) admitted yesterday that he is being paid to do nothing.The Senate hearing focused on laglag bala, the alleged extortion scheme wherein airport personnel “plant” bullets in the bags of unsuspecting airline passengers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).Jose Angel Honrado said he has “no control” over the 22 agencies that are under his jurisdiction, adding that his main responsibility is “coordination” and ensuring a “smooth flow” of airport operations.But he insists he has no clue over what’s been happening at NAIA, to which Marcos asked, “So, if you have no control as general manager, what is your job?”Honrado has been the MIAA general manager since 2010.

"The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) dubbed as “premature and hasty” the decision of a the Manila Regional Trial Court (MRTC) to acquit the daughter of Yu Yuk Lai, Diana Yu Uy, of illegal drug charges because of insufficient evidence.PDEA Director General Aaron Aquino, in a radio interview on Friday morning, also refuted the court’s finding that “there is strong evidence that the packets of shabu recovered from her condominium unit in Manila were planted.”“We here in PDEA are devastated that this is what happened to the case. We worked hard to arrest her then it will just result in this,” Aquino said of the decision of Judge Daniel Villanueva of MRTC 49.“It hurts that the judge concluded the drugs found in the house of Uy were planted. Where are we going to get drugs to plant on her?” Aquino asked.He also denied Uy’s allegation that PDEA agents accepted P5 million in exchange for not getting her into drugs.Uy was arrested in her condominium unit near Malacañang in November last year after authorities seized P10 million worth of shabu and bank checks in Lai’s mother’s cell at the Correctional Institution for Women.PDEA insisted that Lai used Uy as her operator while she was in detention.Uy denied that she is involved in illegal drug activities and insisted that she only has her rice retailing business and that PDEA agents planted the drugs in her residence.",1
"“HE IS NOT JUST A MATHEMATICIAN, BUT A POLYMATH,” this is how University of the Philippines (UP) – Diliman Mathematics Professor Augusto Hermosilla described the RJ Nieto, the man who owns the controversial political blog ‘Thinking Pinoy’.The post of the U.P Professor was already posted several months ago, but it became viral again when the blogger who was accused of spreading fake news attended the Senate investigation on false information on social media last Wednesday.According to the Professor Hermosilla, Nieto who finished his major in Mathematics was one of his brightest students in the University of the Philippines.Despite of not getting a good start in college compared to his classmates who came from prestigious universities in Manila, he managed to surpass them by his hard work and determination. Hermosilla said that Nieto, quickly understood even very complex and challenging concepts.He was also impressed by Nieto, because it’s very rare for a math major to be a member of the university debating team, not only inside, but outside the university.According to him, even the most gifted mathematics major cannot manage to join the debating team, an evidence that Nieto is a very gifted student.The hard work of Nieto also made him survive the Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (MBB) course which he enrolled, despite of having only a little background in Biology and Chemistry.Hermosilla said that the extensive research and joining biology classes had to make Nieto catch up on many strange and mind boggling jargon of MBB.Nieto completed the MBB course and learned it more than his classmates who were majors in the course.The professor said that Nieto can learn diverse and disparate topics in a short time, because of this, he tagged the owner of Thinking Pinoy as a ‘genius’ who does not settle for just a mediocre “good enough”.This is the whole post of Augusto Hermosilla:“ RJ Nieto was one of my most brilliant students in the University of the Philippines – Diliman, Quezon City, where he majored in Mathematics, while I was a professor at the Institute of Mathematics. I can really say that I have been there all throughout his formative years in his becoming a mathematician par excellence. Indeed, he was verily one of my most brightest students. Although he didn’t have as much of a head start in college compared to his peers, especially coming from a provincial high school as compared to his peers coming from prestigious schools in Metro-Manila, he however managed to excel by hard work and dogged determination so as to top above and over all of his classes. As a very fast learner, he is someone who can easily understand even very complex and challenging concepts, and simply them as like to water them down in to something that everyone else among his peers can understand to their low level. Also, it is very rare for a math major to be a member of the university debating team, which involves in debates, not just inside, but also outside the university. Actually, he was the only one who managed to do it even as a mathematics major gifted with such impeccable and perspicacious logic. His mind doesn’t to work like anybody else. He is hardworking and so determine to excel in any field of endeavor that he can find himself interested and involved in! I remember that time when he enrolled in an elective Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (MBB) class under a visiting professor from Ludwig-Maximilians-University-Munich of Germany. He had very little background in Biology and Chemistry. But he did extensive research and even sat down in biology classes to learn to catch up on the many strange and mindboggling jargons in MBB. I can say that it was as if he majored in and learned Biology in a just month. He even ended up acing the course, even above and over his classmates who were majors in the course. That is, he did so much better than his classmates who were MBB majors themselves. This somehow shows that RJ is not just a mathematician, but a polymath at that to learn diverse and desparate topics in a short and fast time!!! When he works, he does not settle for just a mediocre “good enough.” Instead, he makes sure that everything he does is better than what he last works did. This is something that I really admire about this young man. He is a genius who should be honed to pursue more excellence.”Nieto replied to a Netizen who asked for the credibility of Professor Hermosilla, he gave an information about the professor and also about his college life in U.P.“Prof. Oggie Hermosilla was my mentor back in UP Math. He specializes in Mathematical Heuristics (e.g. neural networks, genetic algorithms), including their application to actuarial mortality models. He’s the reason why I studied Computational Biology and Biomathematics (MBB 197) on my sophomore year. I skipped Math 17 after taking the Advanced Placement Exams (with his help sa review). I also was able to finish my Calculus Series (Math 63, 64, 65, 123.1, 123.2, and 128) early and easily because he was my pro bono tutor-cheerleader. Uno ako sa lahat na yan maliban sa Math 64 dahil naadik ako sa Ragnarok noong summer na yon. Hahaha. Actually, yung Math 64 lang ang hindi ko uno. Wala na kasi ako noong pera dahil gipit na (namatayan ako ng tatay when I was 17) kaya naawa sa akin so siya na lang nagturo/nag pep talk. He’s one of the most intelligent professors UP Math has ever had.”Nieto gained thousands of new followers on Facebook because of his impressive answers and expose during the senate investigation on fake news.Aside from being a blogger, Nieto is also a consultant in Department of Foreign Affairs.We did not found the original post of Professor Hermosilla so we embedded some re posts from netizen Tony Santillan and Anj Padernal.Sources:",0
"Former SenatorThe root cause of homelessness is poverty due to joblessness. Without jobs, there’s no income. And if there’s no income, there’s no purchasing power to afford decent housing. That’s the reality on the ground, plain and simple.Gloria “Ka Bea” Arellano, national chairperson of the urban poor group Kalipunan ng Damayang Mahihirap (Kadamay), was guest in last Sunday’s episode of my teleradyo program Sagot Ko ‘Yan (DZMM, 8 to 9 a.m. Sundays) and our discussions boiled down to this basic truth: To attain success in the efforts to provide decent housing for the homeless poor, livelihood and jobs with decent wages have to be available for them.Otherwise, she pointed out, relocated informal settler families (ISFs) will continue leaving government relocation sites and keep coming back to urban areas where they were removed, including danger zones, to resume their livelihood or be near to whatever jobs they have. Even the Balik Probinsiya program will never attain absolute success unless countryside development enables ISFs to have sufficient income in rural areas.In the course of our discussion, Ka Bea also debunked news reports that the homeless poor were demanding free housing. She stressed that the Kadamay members who took over thousands of vacant housing units in Pandi and San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, were willing to pay amortization as long as the amount agreed upon is affordable and the government housing projects are completely developed.As it is now, a number of the houses originally allotted for soldiers and policemen are unfinished, with no utilities, no ceiling, no drainage, no toilets even. And other basic amenities like schools and clinics are missing in the housing sites. Thus, if there is community development and the beneficiaries see where amortizations are being spent on, Kadamay members shall be happy to pay their dues, Ka Bea assured. Even fees for water will be gladly paid as long water connection is installed individually to houses.Explaining why Kadamay members forced their way into the Bulacan housing projects, Ka Bea said the ISFs in Bulacan and elsewhere have long been asking NHA for more homes, to no avail. They even brought their nagging problem to Malacanang when President Duterte took over last year. They have become impatient; it was taking government so long to address their appeal for housing. She also lamented that relocation sites were not enough because the number of ISFs were not fully considered as when two or more families were living in a single dwelling before they were relocated.When Kadamay members took over the empty housing units last March, many people found merit in their logic: “There is something clearly wrong if there are thousands of idle houses while the number of homeless continues to increase. There is no reason the housing units should be left to vegetation, dirt, and pests.”The insights brought out by Ka Bea in our discussion last Sunday highlights anew what government needs to be doing: Housing agencies must allow for genuine participation and consultation of the urban poor in finding ways to effectively deal with the growing housing shortage estimated now at about 5.5 million units and is expected to reach about 6.8 million in the next five years. Also, government must help the urban poor make their own analysis of their situation and help them come up with clear solutions to the housing crisis, including land acquisition and financing.That many impoverished Filipinos in Metro Manila still live in squalid and subhuman conditions or in roofless quarters can be truly appalling especially if one considers that fellow human beings wallow in the luxury of high-rise condos that continue sprouting all over the metropolis.It has become more imperative for government to act with a sense of extreme urgency in implementing provisions of RA 7279, the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA) of 1992, the so-called “Lina Law” that I crafted way back in 1992 in line with the State policy to “uplift the conditions of the underprivileged and homeless citizens in urban areas and in resettlement areas by making available to them decent housing at affordable cost, basic services, and employment opportunities.”The law also calls on government, local and national, to give “particular attention to the needs and requirements of the underprivileged and homeless citizens and not merely on the basis of market forces.”UDHA clearly provides the mechanism by which affordable housing could be made available for poor beneficiaries. Unfortunately, no administration has ever taken the initiative or mustered enough political will to implement a legacy program of socialized housing. But there’s great hope the dreams of millions of homeless Filipinos will be realized under this administration.As I wrote in a previous column (MB, May 31, 2016), a massive socialized housing program will be a lasting legacy—a solid, uncontroversial, and highly significant achievement—of President Duterte if he can provide decent and affordable housing for the poorest of the poor.But he must not waste time. He must immediately direct the country’s 1,494 town mayors, 181 city mayors, 81 governors, and the more than 40,000 barangay chairmen, to fully implement UDHA.While UDHA seeks to reduce homelessness, the long-term goal should be development of the countryside and creation of jobs which is the ultimate solution. Indeed, the root cause of homelessness is poverty due to joblessness. Without jobs, there’s no income. And if there’s no income, there’s no purchasing power to afford decent housing.E-mail: finding.lina@yahoo.com",1
"The Supreme Court (SC), sitting as Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), has set a new schedule for a recount of votes in connection with an electoral protest filed by former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo.The recount will start on April 2, from the original March 19.In a statement from the Marcos camp, spokesman Vic Rodriguez said the electoral tribunal had cited lack of revisors for the new schedule.“Reason of [the tribunal] is only 42 of the 50 revisors have qualifed/passed the psychological exam. According to them, whether or not they can fill the remaining 8, manual recount will proceed on April 2,” Rodriguez added.“In the interest of transparency, we would like to inform our supporters, especially those who have long been anticipating the revision/recounting of votes in the election protest of former senator [Marcos] at the SupremeCourt, that the scheduled revision/recount has been moved from March 19, 2018 to April 2, 2018 due to the incomplete staffing requirements of the [electoral tribunal],” he said.The Presidential Electoral Tribunal has ordered decryption of ballots despite objections from the Robredo camp.The decryption and printing of ballot images will be from three pilot provinces: Camarines Sur, Iloilo and Negros Oriental.Marcos lost to Robredo by 263,473 votes in the race for Vice President in the 2016 elections.He has since accused her of “massive electoral fraud, anomalies and irregularities such as pre-shading of ballots, pre-loading of Secure Digital cards, misreading of ballots, malfunctioning VCMs [vote counting machines] and an “abnormally high” unaccounted votes/undervotes for the position of Vice President.",1
"Tropical Storm “Huaning” (international name: “Haitang”) exited the Philippine area of responsibility Monday morning, but the weather bureau is still watching the Northern Luzon coasts FOR another typhoon nearing the country.The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said Huaning was last spotted 525 kilometers northwest of Basco, Batanes and all storm warnings have been lifted.“[But] sea travel remains risky over the seaboards of northern Luzon and the western seaboard of central Luzon,” Pagasa said.A gale warning was hoisted over these areas on Monday because southwesterly winds may enhance the storm and cause rough coastal waters.Aside from Huaning, state weather forecaster Gener Quitlong said Pagasa was also watching typhoon “Noru,” which was last spotted 1,975 kilometers east of Basco, outside the PAR.Quitlong said the typhoon may approach PAR borders but was expected to move away over the next few days.Meanwhile, tropical cyclone “Gorio” (international name: “Nesat”), which preceded Huaning, is still at northwest of Basco but was forecasted to disintegrate in the next few days, Quitlong said.",1
"The ruling Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) will investigate its members who committed electioneering and other violations of the election law during the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) polls on Monday.But the party president, Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, said the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) must provide evidence against the officials.“If the DILG gives us the evidence, [we will investigate]. We have no feedback as of now,” Pimentel told reporters on Tuesday.Opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives also challenged the DILG to substantiate the claim of Undersecretary Martin Diño that congressmen had engaged in vote buying.RampantVote buying was rampant in the barangay and SK elections, with reports of crisp P20 to P1,000 bills changing hands in many villages across the country.The Omnibus Election Code prohibits vote buying by candidates, with violators facing prison terms of one to six years and disqualification from holding public office.Pimentel challenged the DILG to gather evidence and press charges against barangay chairs and 100 House members who, according to Diño, intervened in village elections by trying to influence their constituents to vote for their favored candidates.Diño was quoted in news reports as saying his department had received reports that “some of the congressmen gave money, while others invited candidates.”He claimed that the congressmen, as well as around 1,000 local government officials and thousands of barangay officials, resorted to vote buying to secure turfs “in preparation for the 2019 elections.”Nonpartisan“If they control the barangay captains, of course, they control the entire barangay,” the DILG official said in a television interview on Monday night.The May 14 barangay and SK elections were supposed to be nonpartisan.Pimentel said the DILG should take action if it had evidence.“It’s better that we make examples of these people, so that in the election next year, the same thing won’t happen again,” he said.“Whether a party member or not, it doesn’t matter. The question is what is the evidence, whether it’s vote buying or other violations of [the] election law, in which case, cases must be filed,” said Pimentel, who will seek reelection in the 2019 midterm elections.Makabayan blocHe noted that the distribution of sample ballots at polling precincts was a violation of election law.Gabriela Rep. Emerenciana de Jesus of the Makabayan bloc said Diño should identify the congressmen.“Diño should let his hands do the talking not his mouth by filing cases against those who violated election laws in the recent barangay polls,” said Akbayan Rep. Tomasito Villarin of the “Magnificent Seven” independent bloc.Federalism campaignA fellow bloc member, Ifugao Rep. Teddy Baguilat Jr., said he would be “fully supportive” of the DILG if it was “really serious in filing cases.”But Baguilat called on Diño to address the concern to the PDP-Laban.Barangay officials have “become highly politicized because of PDP-Laban’s federalism campaign,” Baguilat said, as the officials of the country’s smallest political units were made to pledge support for the administration’s push to amend the Constitution.“It’s no wonder why many of them now approach solons and local executives asking for cash support during elections because [they] consider themselves party mates and ward leaders of the politicians,” he said.‘Stop blaming poor’On Tuesday, an urban poor group said election officials should stop blaming the poor in the wake of reports of rampant vote buying.“We need to cleanse our government from corrupt politicians who are known to surely make up for their expenses when they win in elections,” said Gloria Arellano, chair of Kalipunan ng Damayang Mahihirap (Kadamay).Patronage politicsKadamay said vote buying was part of patronage politics in the country. It persists because the electorate is not being provided basic services and their living standards have hardly improved, the group said.The National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) described the problem as “one symptom of a deeper social malaise.”“Poverty, lack of economic opportunities and the absence of universal and comprehensive social protection make millions of Filipinos more vulnerable to patronage politics,” said Jennifer Padilla, NAPC information officer.",1
"Transport authorities would launch a nationwide crackdown against new ride-hailing app Arcade City should it continue to defy the government and push through with its Philippine operations on Monday.The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Saturday assailed Arcade City for continuing to defy the cease and desist order issued by the agency.The app was encouraging illegal transport network companies and unregistered transport network providers, said LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada.Protecting the publicIf Arcade City goes online on Monday, Lizada said enforcers from LTFRB, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, Land Transportation Office and Philippine National Police’s Highway Patrol Group would go undercover as passengers to apprehend the app’s drivers and impound their vehicles.“We cannot afford any more irregularities such as this,” Lizada said. “We need to protect the riding public.”After Arcade City was ordered this week to cease operations for the second time, it taunted the LTFRB by saying that the board did not understand how its technology and model work.The online firm said it “does not fit the LTFRB definition of a transportation network company.”It said it would not require payment from riders and drivers but use cryptocurrency called “Arcade tokens” which could be sold for cash or used to purchase services or goods in Arcade.Should Arcade operate, Lizada said it would be tagged as a “colorum” or illegal.She said the LTFRB would also coordinate with the US Embassy and the Department of Information and Communications Technology to take action against Arcade founder and chief executive officer, Christopher David.“He is making a mockery of our rules and regulations,” she said of David, who packaged his company as an alternative to Uber.",1
"The recent announcement by China that it would soon abandon its controversial one-child policy in favor of allowing all couples to have two children has caught the attention of a Philippine senator.China’s controversial one-child policy was introduced nationally in 1979 to slow the population growth rate, and is estimated to have prevented about 400 million births.Though there were exceptions to the policy, most couples who violated it faced punishment, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions.It said the decision was made because of China’s rapidly ageing population and to help support the economy.In the Philippines, Senator Nancy Binay, daughter of the country’s vice president, is sponsoring a new bill that would put in place a mandatory four-child policy in the country. No more, no less.Binay says her proposal constitutes a middle ground between the country’s overpopulation and the need to boost economic productivity.“While overpopulation is the root of poverty in our country, we also recognize that we need the manpower to fuel the economy, especially at a time when many international corporations are outsourcing their labor requirements,” Binay said.The Philippines is fast becoming the center of business process outsourcing (BPO) because Filipinos are hard-working and speak English very well compared to their counterparts in the rest of Asia.“Four is the magic number,” says Binay, “because it limits families from having too many children whom they can hardly feed or send to school. On the other hand, families who could afford to have more than one or two kids, will be encouraged to have more as their contribution to strengthening and stabilizing our labor force.”The Philippine Senate will soon be conducting public hearings to determine the appropriate punishment or penalties for families who have less than four children, or, more than four.",0

"four people are missing from the wreckage of a hotel in central Italy that was flattened by a deadly avalanche, with difficult research and rescue operations still ongoing, authorities said on Sunday, January 22.A statement from the national fire service said the number of people missing rose by one after a rescued person said that a hotel employee, of Senegalese origin, was inside the building at the moment of the avalanche.So far five people have been confirmed dead, and nine, including four children, were pulled alive from tons of rubble and snow on Saturday, January 21.“Operations continue, both inside and outside the hotel, there is no change in the numbers (of saved and dead people),” spokesman Luca Cari said in the statement.The luxury Hotel Rigopiano, located at the foot of a mountain chain in the central Italian region of Abruzzo, was obliterated on Wednesday after an avalanche caused by an earthquake smashed into its spa and demolished the four-storey building.“The situation unfortunately is the same as the last few days, we keep working nonstop, under extremely difficult weather conditions… but we will carry on working as quickly as we possibly can,” said Major Marco Amoriello.He added that weather conditions were not helping operations and that the forecast for the next few days did not look good.“But we certainly won’t be stopping because of that,” Amoriello said.Some rescue workers said they did not rule out finding more survivors, more than three days after the disaster.Around 120,000 tonnes of frozen snow covered much of what was left of the hotel, a colonel from a fire brigade team working on-site told television Sky TG24.Nine of the eleven survivors are still hospitalized in the nearby city of Pescara, with some of them leaving hospital as soon as Monday.“Thank you for being close, and for the real help you are bringing,” said Pope Francis on Sunday at his weekly Angelus audience, referring to those involved in rescue and relief operations and asking to pray for them and the families of the victims.Prosecutors in the central Italian city of Pescara have opened a probe over alleged unintentional multiple manslaughter and negligence causing a large-scale disaster.Read more: Italy crews work through night after avalanche hits hotel",1

"Communist rebels owned up to the attack on a government convoy in Camarines Sur that killed three policemen, claiming that information from police helped them set the ambush up.The National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the umbrella organization of underground rebel groups, said Nela Charade Puno, head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who was in the convoy, was not the target of the ambush.Philippine National Police Director General Oscar Albayalde expressed belief the attack could be a failure of intelligence on the part of police in the area.The NDFP, in its statement, said Albayalde was “right when he said there were lapses when it comes to intelligence.”Leak from PNPThe rebel group said “tactical information” about the convoy came from the PNP, although it did not say whether rebels had a spy inside the police force.The NDFP said the ambush was in retaliation for President Duterte’s decision to abandon peace talks and wage a war of attrition against rebels, which led to abuses.The group added that it was also in response to summary killings of rebel suspects justified by the supposed “Red October” plot to oust Mr. Duterte led by rebels.Albayalde was at the wake of the three slain policemen on Friday — SPO1 Percival Rafael, PO3 Carlito Navarroza and PO1 Ralph Jason Vida.They were among a group of policemen providing security to Puno in Lupi town, Camarines Sur.“There were shortcomings in the intelligence,” Albayalde told reporters, citing a briefing given by police in the area.‘Public knowledge’The PNP chief earlier said there might have been a leak of information on security plans for Puno.The Army, however, said the information about the route taken by the security convoy for Puno was “public knowledge” because the FDA chief was headed to an event in Daet in Camarines Norte province.Col. Ferozaldo Paul Regencia, spokesperson for the Army’s 9th Infantry Division, said even without an intelligence leak, police would be targeted because they used marked vehicles.“The rebels can make some calculations of the time of arrival of the convoy,” Regencia said.“I think this is very logical,” he added.Chief Insp. Maria Luisa Calubaquib, spokesperson for the Bicol police, said the regional police had yet to determine if there was, indeed, a leak of intelligence and its source.‘Hearsay’Without saying if she was referring to Albayalde’s theory about a leak, Calubaquib said “it’s hard to believe in hearsay.”“We need basis,” Calubaquib said.Albayalde, however, said one question that popped up as a result of the ambush was why the policemen were not “given reinforcement immediately.”“We are not looking for failures on the part of our local police,” he, however, added.Some relatives expressed dismay at Puno for failing to reach out to families of the slain policemen who were protecting her.“My husband died escorting her,” said Grace Rafael, widow of SPO1 Rafael.“Where is she now? We didn’t even hear a thing from her,” she said.Albayalde said the policemen “died fighting.” “They fought and sacrificed their lives,” Albayalde said. “They are real heroes.”",1
"President Aquino on Monday asked residents in provinces on the path of Typhoon “Lando” (international name: Koppu) not to be complacent and heed all warnings of flash floods.The President, who led the distribution of relief goods to 204 families evacuated at Nueva Ecija National High School here, said about 800 villages in several provinces were susceptible to runoff from northern mountain ranges accumulated during weeklong rains spawned by the typhoon.“Now, the challenge with a lot of our countrymen is that, they don’t seem to see the amount of rain it is pouring, they think it is safe already to go back to their communities but we are preventing them right now because the expectations from tonight and after tomorrow, are a lot of this rainfall that fell on the northern portion of Luzon will be coming down and will be affecting all of these barangays near the major river systems,” he told reporters here.Mr. Aquino arrived here at 4:30 p.m. accompanied by Social Welfare Secretary Corazon Soliman, Nueva Ecija Gov. Aurelio Umali and Cabanatuan City Mayor Julius Cesar Vergara.The President distributed relief packs containing instant coffee, instant noodles, canned goods, rice and blankets and kitchen wares.Mr. Aquino said government agencies were still collating data related to the damage wrought by the typhoon, noting that communication services and electricity supply have yet to be restored in many areas in northern and central Luzon.“But there are less and less areas that are somewhat isolated. Cabanatuan, in fact, was part of the list of those isolated, that’s why we are here,” he said.“The challenge here is that you have a lingering typhoon as opposed to just crossing our landmass in a matter of a few hours. The expectations for the effects of this particular typhoon are about three days long,” he added.Mr. Aquino assured that personnel of various electric cooperatives in typhoon-hit areas are checking their transmission lines to ensure that these are safe by the time these are reenergized.He said the typhoon had not left the Luzon landmass and had veered northeast, threatening provinces in the Ilocos and Cordillera regions.“That’s what we are trying to gear up for. And of course, we want to prevent any spread of a disease, leptospirosis is considered a threat especially the way through the floodwaters,” he said.“Again, we will not take any chance and we will try to ensure that we are on the side of being conservative and making sure that everybody is protected during this time,” the President said.",1
"The media and the partisans who presume to constitute the Philippine National “Debate” may have succeeded at dividing the Philippines into Dutertards and Yellowtards and, they presume, maintain a lively chatter that, they say, is the heart of a vibrant “democracy”. But whilst this chatter is generating a lot of noise, none of that noise seems to be turning into any real insight.What constitutes insightful commentary is defined along very stringent lines which means that only a tiny elite community of commentators constitute the set of people who actually contribute insight to the “debate”. Insightful commentary is useful because it is readily converted to actionable intelligence. The opposite of insight is the 80 percent of content that infests the Net that fail to pass the So What? Test.Only true thought leaders produce true insight. They live at the top of the intellectual food chain and apply a disaffected outsiders’ perspective when observing and evaluating the ecosystem they comment on and when formulating and articulating their theses and conclusions. The intellectual tools they apply are critical rather than reactive and are designed to mitigate the effects of emotional response and confirmation bias.Intellectual added value, in short, is a parameter that varies up and down the intellectual food chain. In the political commentary industry we can actually use existing jargon to tier intellectual added value along notional roles and personal labels various players in the industry take to describe or define their work. At the bottom of the food chain are news reporters who trawl the streets for facts to populate the factual reports that make up the bulk of news media content. Feeding off these news reports (and perhaps their own fact-gathering from other sources and references) are “investigative journalists” who take facts and connect them with other facts to form compound facts and theories. The conclusions “investigative journalists” draw from “connecting the dots” are validated primarily by fact checking their component factual parts and determining whether the methods they use to string these parts together follows sound logic.News reports and investigative journalism form the atoms and molecules of information that the next two work with.Opinion-shapers are the intellectual alchemists who have a type of substance in mind as an end-state to achieve from which they backward-engineer ideas and frameworks into which they shoehorn news reports and “investigative journalism” to elicit an emotional response. Their primary tool of persuasion is appeal to emotion and their argument-of-last-resort is credentialism or appeal to authority.Finally there are the true intellectual titans — those who eat planets and suns. These are the thought leaders. They exhibit astounding consistency grounded on first principles across time and conceptual space unparallelled by any of the bottom- to mid-tier feeders. As a result, the theses they form are more often than not innovative, original, and unprecedented. More importantly, their ideas are also timeless and anti-fragile (i.e. they grow more robust the more they are subject to critical evaluation). This is a rarefied domain where true thinking outside the square happens. This is where insight that fuels forward-thinking and strategic roadmapping is produced.There you have it. The class hierarchy in the Philippine National “Debate” ordered from smallest to biggest intellectual added value to the discourse:(1) News reporters(2) Investigative journalists(3) Opinion-shapers(4) Thought leadersNo one person or entity does work exclusively for any one class. But one can be measured on how big a proportion of one’s work fits each one. A fun exercise would then be to classify the who’s who of social media personalities who contribute to the current political chatter along these lines.",0
"THE Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) will soon come out with the new guidelines to be followed in the deployment of Filipino workers to Kuwait.Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd signed over the weekend Administrative Orders 254-18 and 254A-18, lifting the ban on the deployment of newly-hired skilled and semi-skilled workers, as well as household service workers to Kuwait and the issuance of the guidelines for the processing and deployment of domestic workers or household service workers (HSWs), relative to the signing of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) that protects HSWs.Bello created a cluster committee, headed by Undersecretary Jacinto V.

"President Rodrigo Duterte is not keen on proposals to defer an increase in monthly contribution of Social Security System (SSS) members starting this year to compensate for a pension hike, according to a Palace official.In a statement, Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar on Thursday said Duterte already made his decision after “carefully” weighing the problem.The President on Tuesday approved the P1,000-pension increase starting this year but with a corresponding 1.5 percent increase in monthly premium starting May 2017.“The President has carefully weighed both sides to solve the SSS impasse and he has already made a decision.The increase in the SSS pension effective this quarter will be financed by current contributions and investment income,” Andanar told reporters.He said the increase in premium would be used to strengthen the long-term viability of the pension fund.“The planned 1.5 percent increase in contribution in May 2017 will be used to improve the Investment Reserve Fund in order to generate higher yields for investments, and to further strengthen the overall viability of the pension fund so it can meet future obligations,” Andanar added.But senators from the Liberal Party have questioned the President’s decision.While lauding the pension hike, Senate President Pro-Tempore Franklin Drilon on Wednesday called the increase in SSS premium “invalid” and “illegal.”Drilon pointed out that Republic Act 8282 or the Social Security Law prohibits the pension fund from offering additional benefits that would require increasing contribution of its members.“While the executive’s decision to finally grant the long-awaited increase in the pension of SSS retirees is commendable, it should not be used to justify an increase in the premium payment,” he said in a statement.“The increase in benefits of our pensioners must not come from a similar increase in the burden shouldered by current SSS contributors. The law is crystal clear in that regard,” Drilon added.Sen. Paolo Benigno Aquino 4th said he was surprised after learning about the planned hike in the monthly premium of 34 million SSS members, adding that the fund did not even conduct prior consultations with employers and contributors.Aquino said the SSS is capable of providing the increased pension without demanding that its members contribute more.“What the SSS should do is to improve the collection efficiency instead of demanding bigger contributions from its members,” he added.Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara, however, said the increase in SSS monthly contribution is in order to make surefunds would still be available for future pensioners.Angara, who heads the Senate ways and means committee, added that without additional source of funding, the SSS would not be able to provide pension once young members of the pension fund retire.“The SSS won’t have any reserves to pay its future pensioners if it will not impose an increase in members’ contribution,” he said.In the past 16th Congress, then-President Benigno Aquino 3rd vetoed the law seeking to grant a P2,000-pension increase, saying it would bankrupt the pension fund for private workers.",1
"Oil companies again increased the pump prices of petroleum products, a week after implementing a price rollback.Eastern Petroleum, Flying V, Phoenix Petroleum, Pilipinas Shell, PTT Philippines, Total and Seaoil raised the price of diesel by 55 centavos per liter effective 6 a.m. on Tuesday.The cost of gasoline went up by 35 centavos per liter while the price of kerosene was hiked by 80 centavos per liter.Unioil, meanwhile, raised the prices of diesel and kerosene by 55 centavos per liter and 35 centavos per liter, respectively.The oil price adjustments were announced as consumer group Laban Konsyumer Inc. (LKI) urged the Department of Energy (DoE) to release information on petroleum products and electricity prices.In a letter to Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi dated April 16, the group expressed the need to unbundle the retail prices of fuel products to provide consumers with the necessary information about the fair pricing of oil prices.“DOE will note that oil companies and the new players have practically uniform prices for diesel. This situation does not appear tenable since oil companies and new players procure their products differently,” the group said.LKI President Victor Dimagiba said the DoE has the authority to issue circular mandating the unbundling of retail fuel prices“Even under full deregulation, the DoE secretary is authorized to ensure fair pricing of the petroleum products for the benefit and information of the consumers,” Dimagiba, a former Trade undersecretary, said.On power rates, LKI said the Energy department should regularly publish maintenance schedules of power plants and energy suppliers for transparency and consumer empowerment.",1
"It might be time for “senator” Antonio Trillanes to seek political asylum in the United States. After all, he sees himself as “persecuted” and the subject of attempts to “silence” him. In the West, that indeed constitutes “political persecution” and is enough grounds to consider providing refuge to the “senator”. But will Trillanes’s case meet the criteria sufficiently enough to enable such a hypothetical bid for asylum to prosper?That does not seem to be a promising prospect. There seems to be no real evidence that the Philippine government has mounted initiatives meant to impinge upon basic rights to personal expression and political dissent that Trillanes insists it is engaging in.Indeed, Trillanes himself has taken a lot of liberties speaking his mind at every forum willing to provide him a soapbox to stand on. He has also travelled extensively to meet with “sympathetic” patrons to his cause which include certain European rapporteurs and even US senators who were critical of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in the past. Trillanes, it seems, has spent inordinate amounts of time and resources travelling overseas for various publicity stunts and to stir up support from foreign governments and non-government organisations for his “cause”. He seems to have forgotten that he is, first and foremost, a Philippine senator on paper and actually is in a solid position to address and act on his concerns within the immediate setting of his office. As such, one can’t help but wonder whether these overseas “projects” and schmoozefests with foreign honchos manifests a disturbing lack of confidence in his own country’s system of governance to provide sufficient venue to pursue his agenda.Rather, Trillanes has, instead, banked on what he sees to be a more influential backer — that of foreign interests — and, in the process, has relegated the true source of his mandate — that of the Filipino people closer to home — to validate the credibility of his vision (if it can even be called that) to a small footnote in his thesis. In short, Trillanes has, in the course of seeking endorsement from foreign entities, merely highlighted the bald reality that the Philippines remains a mere vassal state of its former Imperial masters — one that could not function without the tacit approval of their overlords.This is likely because, in reality, Trillanes lacks credibility before his own people. A video taken during a forum in which he spoke before the Filipino-American community during his recent visit to the US shows him facing a “hostile crowd”. It got to a point, during this forum, where the host had to tell a member of the audience to “shut up” and “get out”.There is, therefore, some evidence that Trillanes has stopped listening to his own constituents and has taken it upon himself to unhinge his agenda from any semblance of sensibility and fuel its pursuit mainly on the energy he derives from his own personal hubris and vindictive character.Recall that this is not the first time Trillanes was given a reality check by an observer not picked from within the little echo chamber he has cocooned himself within. Back in June, Trillanes was taken to task for the lack of coherence in his agenda in a confronting interview with BBC journalist Stephen Sackur.In that episode of his talk show HARDtalk, Sackur did not mince words. He first got Trillanes to confirm that he is an avowed democrat then proceeded to grill him on the matter further citing the inconsistency of this vow to uphold democratic rule with his track record of launching coup d’etats (notably described by Sackur as “pathetic” in the way they lasted for no more than a day or two) against a duly-elected president, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, through the 2000s.On that single point, Sackur built a consistently-themed conversation with Trillanes. He kept referring to the simple fact that Duterte had, during his campaign for the presidency, been fully up front about what he envisions his rule will be like, laying on the table every gory detail of the way he plans to make good on his promises to run roughshod over every obstacle — even over “human rights” — to fulfill his mandate to clean up his country. That he won the presidential election with all those ideas laid out before the public to digest is, as Sackur points out more than a few times during the interview, democracy at work.Today, “the majority of Filipinos seem to like his iron fist,” Sackur observes. From there, more pointed questions were fielded by Sackur in rapid succession. One of his most difficult questions to Trillanes was, around whether or not his efforts to take down the Duterte administration were in tune with ordinary Filipinos’ sentiments. Sackur even went as far as describing Trillanes’s comments on the Philippine government as “constantly negative” in that light. Trillanes could only stammer out a response that merely speculated about where Duterte’s numbers could go in the mid-term. Without any actual logic or facts to support or substantiate his claims that Duterte’s popularity cannot be sustained, Trillanes could only insist that he was “confident” that Duterte’s days are numbered.There is enough evidence to conclude that Trillanes’s actions and initiatives of late do not have the broader interests of his constituents in mind but more that of a small clique of groups who are threatened by the erosion of the status quo that they have long benefited from. Indeed, TIME “journalist” Joseph Hincks in a recent article described him as a “principal adversary” of Duterte which pretty much makes him the de facto Opposition leader of the moment and highlights the truth about the real motive behind his activities. But Trillanes is, supposedly, a “senator” — a role that requires that one do things primarily in aid of legislation. Filipinos need to ask this “senator” an important question in that light:What exactly is the legislative agenda that frames Trillanes’s recent activities?Simple answers should suffice. After all, it is often the simplest answers that make the most sense. Perhaps the real answer to that question as far as we have observed is just one word: Nothing.",0
"Last July 2016, both political parties in the United States had their respective National Conventions. The Republican National Convention (RNC) was from 18-21 July, while the Democratic National Convention (DNC) was a week later, 25-28 July. The Republican nominee for President is Donald Trump, while for the Democrats it is Hillary Clinton.Donald Trump is often perceived as the anti-establishment candidate. He is the guy who is trying to be perceived as relating with the plight of ordinary Americans. And yet he has made a lot of enemies out of minority and immigrant communities for his perceived racism, bigotry, and lack of political correctness.Hillary Clinton, to many, represents the traditional politician that Americans have seemingly grown tired of; she has been tied to numerous scandals, and has been painted by her enemies as not being all that truthful with the American public.The overall tone for each of the national conventions couldn’t have been more different. Observers noted that in the RNC, the overriding tone was fear; in the DNC, the overriding message was one of hope.The RNC speakers were making their points that America is no longer safe. America is getting the short end of the stick and is no longer respected in the international community. Illegal immigrants are taking away jobs and are connected to violence and crime in neighborhoods. Donald Trump will “make America great again.”The DNC, on the other hand, had speakers making their points that the type of racist and inward-looking mentality espoused by Trump and the Republicans does not belong in America. America is already great, so they said.In the Philippines, the two-month old presidency of Rodrigo Duterte has had him also make a few major speeches. In particular, his inauguration speech and his first State of the Nation address (SONA) are highlights, the former delivered last 30 June, the latter last 25 July.Watching the speeches, one would get the impression that president Duterte would rather go do actual work than make those speeches. Despite having a prepared address, president Duterte had ad-libbed parts of his addresses. Depending on one’s perspective, the impression one would get is that he is either: speaking from the heart, or going on pointless ramblings and tirades.Similar to the US, the two moods of hope and fear also characterize the Philippine political scene. Hope is festered among not only supporters of Duterte from way back, but also the groups who have been longing for a different kind of politician, one that Duterte’s predecessor, Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino, embodied quintessentially.Fear dominates among the people who are afraid that Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs will descend into anarchy and chaos. Fear is also expressed among the classes who are ultra-sensitive to any impending signs of despotism, dictatorship, and threats to their so-called freedom and democracy.Native Americans, the Cherokee, in particular, have a legend called The Two Wolves which, I think, fits aptly in the current climates of the US and the Philippines:An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. “A fight is going on inside me,” he said to the boy. “It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. One is evil – he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.” He continued, “The other is good – he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you – and inside every other person, too.” The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, “Which wolf will win?” The old Cherokee simply replied, “The one you feed.”In both the US and the Philippine scenes, fear is represented by one wolf, hope by the other.Which one will Americans and Filipinos feed?Whoever wins, it will definitely make for an interesting show.",0

"Derisively called “Terror de Manila” and “pambansang photobomb,” the planned 49-story Torre de Manila apartment building on Taft Avenue in Ermita, Manila, received criticisms and drew protests for ruining the view of the Rizal Monument.In June 2012, when it was granted zoning permit, tour guide and activist Carlos Celdran launched an online campaign against the construction of the project, saying that the structure would mar the view of the iconic monument of national hero Dr. Jose Rizal at Luneta.In July of the same year, the city government of Manila, under the administration of then Mayor Alfredo Lim, granted a building permit to developer DM Consunji Inc. (DMCI) Homes after it submitted all requirements, including approval from the city planning office in the form of a zoning permit.In November 2013, months after former President and now Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada took over, the City Council suspended the project’s construction citing zoning violations. However, construction continued after the Manila Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals granted DMCI an exemption from the zoning regulation.In September 2014, the Knights of Rizal, along with Las Damas de Rizal Philippines Inc., filed a petition in the Supreme Court to stop DMCI from proceeding with the project and to order the “immediate and complete demolition” of Torre de Manila.The group sought the building’s demolition because it allegedly violated several laws protecting national heritage sites, including the local zoning ordinance that allows only school and government buildings of up to seven stories to be built in that part of Manila.At the time, construction was around 23-percent complete, having reached 19 floors.In November 2014, the high court ordered the inclusion of the National Commission on Culture and the Arts (NCCA), National Museum of the Philippines, National Historical Commission of the Philippines and Manila city officials as interveners in the case.Hearings on the Torre de Manila project were also conducted in the House of Representatives and Senate in 2014.On Jan. 5, 2015, the NCCA issued a cease and desist order on the structure. The order was served on the Torre work site on Jan. 13. The agency said the order would be implemented indefinitely until it determined whether construction of the building “destroys or significantly alters the landscape” of the Rizal Monument.The NCCA, however, claimed that DMCI had not abided by the order as shown by footage of ongoing construction at the work site.On June 16, 2015, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) to suspend the construction of the building. Aside from arguments that the building desecrated the shrine and burial ground of the national hero, issues of procedural infirmities involving the Manila city government also emerged during the earlier oral arguments.In August 2015, Solicitor General Florin Hilbay called on the Supreme Court to orderDMCI to demolish the Torre de Manila not only for marring the view of the Rizal Monument but also for building it with undue haste using invalid permits.In October 2015, DMCI asked the high court to lift the TRO. The Supreme Court began to tackle the plea of the company in September last year.Torre de Manila is planned to have 49 floors, including 41 floors for residential units, four levels for podium parking space, three for basement parking and a ground floor for various amenities. It has a land area of 7,448 square meters.",1
"A netizen Nicole Carriedo shares her terrifying story to social media in hopes that it will raise awareness to the public. According to her, she was sleeping beside her sister when she noticed that her sister stretching and tensing around 1:45 am.She thought of it as nothing because her sister often shakes when stretching her body until she realized that the shaking was taking longer than her sister would normally do. It took about 3 minutes after the girl managed to speak and ask for her help while hugging her.Realizing that something is horribly wrong, Nicole panics but managed to carry her sister to a nearby medical facility where she was put in an ambulance and transported to a hospital.The girl needed to undergo tests, including an EEG but Nicole is staying positive that her little sister will be okay.Initially, they were told by doctors that the most likely cause of the seizures her sister had was due to excessive use of electronic gadgets such as mobile phones and tablets.This is not the first case of kids having seizures because of prolonged use of gadgets. A few days ago, a similar story of a young girl who suffered the same stroke-like seizures made the rounds in social media. It was said that the girl's mother is often busy making handicraft products while her kid indulge herself in playing and watching videos on her electronic gadgets.Doctors say that children are most vulnerable to suffer this condition that is why limiting the screen time or the time the they spend using electronic gadgets to a maximum of 2 hours a day. Using gadgets in a proper position could also lessen the chances of discomfort that may in turn be the cause of seizures. Sitting up right or standing up is the best position when using gadgets as it would not disrupt the circulation of our blood as much as when we are lying down.",0
"Fake news and deceitful allies are not modern phenomena. These were problems faced by leaders of the 1896 Revolution, according to the great-grandson of the first Philippine President, Emilio Aguinaldo.“History repeats itself in so many ways,” Emilio Aguinaldo Suntay III said, citing as an example the false information fed to the media by the US government that presented Filipinos as savages who needed American guidance to justify their colonization at the turn of the 20th century.“The Americans had designs on the country and had acquired the Philippines from Spain because of its gold and strategic location,” said Suntay, administrator of the interactive Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo Museum here.Anti-imperialist Americans like writer Mark Twain opposed the subjugation of the Philippines and countered the American “yellow press” with their own editorials and news reports, he said.Suntay also reflected on the “naiveté” of Filipino leaders like Aguinaldo, who allied with the US government to defeat Spain during the Philippine Revolution.But the United States had already bought the Philippines from Spain and staged a “mock battle of Manila Bay” to hide the deceit, he said.Aguinaldo may have realized he was being duped but did not know how to respond to the Americans, being “less a politician like Andres Bonifacio and more astute as a military tactician,” Suntay said.National Flag DaySuntay spoke to Baguio officials as he toured them through the Aguinaldo museum on Sunday, National Flag Day.He is the grandson of Aguinaldo’s daughter Cristina, to whom the late general bequeathed what is arguably the original Philippine flag that was raised in Kawit, Cavite, as well as the Palanan (Isabela) battle flag, which was kept in a bank vault for decades.These flags are on display in a temperature-controlled room in the museum.In 2015 and 2016, Suntay urged young Filipinos to rally behind the first flag as an expression of patriotism given the impact of Chinese incursions in Philippine territory in the West Philippine Sea.On Sunday, he said Filipinos should study and be inspired by the military tactics and skills used by the revolutionary leaders.Magdiwang vs MagdaloAccording to him, people have been more preoccupied with the feud among the leaders as portrayed in movies, forgetting that the same leaders also agreed to unite under one military to fight Spain after the revolution broke in 1896.The 1897 Tejeros Convention in Cavite province was a military assembly and the participating Magdiwang group, led by Bonifacio, and the Magdalo group, led by Aguinaldo, “were never really rival factions,” Suntay said.“They just had different territories which faced a mighty Spanish military machinery so they had to organize into a single army,” he said.According to him, the Tejeros Convention established the shift of the revolution from a political campaign waged by Bonifacio and Dr. Jose Rizal to a military campaign led by Aguinaldo.Suntay also said the 1899 Battle of Tirad Pass, where the young general Gregorio del Pilar was killed, was described as a military failure during the Philippine-American war.But he said the present generation “should see it as our version of ‘300.’”Suntay was referring to the 300 Spartans who died while protecting a mountain pass against the invading Persian army in 480 B.C.",1
"Business leaders are supportive of President Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs and have lauded his political will, according to the chairman emeritus of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI).PCCI Chairman Emeritus Francis Chua said heads of various chambers of commerce approve of Mr. Duterte’s leadership, particularly his will to curb the country’s drug problem.“You will be surprised that a lot of [business leaders] are saying this is the kind of the President that the Asean needs,” Chua told reporters on the sidelines of the opening of the 13th China-Asean Expo (Caexpo) and the 13th China-Asean Business and Investment Summit (Cabis) held here on Sunday.“In some countries in Asia, their leaders are not strong enough. We really pray hard for the success of President Duterte. If he succeeds, then that’s a story that everybody could follow and emulate,” he added.Chua, who is also the president of the newly formed Philippine-Silk Road International Chamber, said business leaders are not worried about the alleged human-rights violations committed by some officials in their bid to curb the drug menace.",0

"PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has named presidential adviser on Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) Abdullah Mama-o as the country’s special envoy to Kuwait, Malacañang said Tuesday.Palace spokesman Harry Roque, Jr. said the appointment was announced during the Cabinet meeting on Monday afternoon.“Secretary Mama-o had just returned from Kuwait. He came bearing good news for the President. But the President then said that Secretary Mama-o would be appointed as Special Envoy to Kuwait and he was tasked to return to Kuwait immediately to make sure that all Filipinos who should be sent back home can return home,” Roque said.Mama-o replaces Ambassador Renato Villa who was expelled by the Kuwaiti government over the rescue operations launched by the Philippine government for distressed Filipino workers.Mama-o left for Kuwait on May 1.Roque said he is confident that the appointment of Mama-o will help normalize the ties between the Philippines and Kuwait and lead to the signing of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Philippines and Kuwait.“We know our unsettled businesses. We have three diplomats [that are under restricted movements], we have four drivers [that are behind bars]. We want to see our three diplomats home, we want to see the four drivers cleared and there are about 800 runaway [OFWs] that we want to take home,” Roque said.“So, the mandate of secretary Mama-o is to take everyone home and to possibly normalize ties with Kuwait, sign the MOU, if possible,” he added.Duterte banned the deployment of workers to Kuwait after the body of Joanna Demafelis was found inside a freezer in an abandoned apartment in the Gulf State. He said the ban will stay until a memorandum of understanding protecting Filipino workers is signed.There are about 262,000 Filipinos working in Kuwait.",1

"“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way…” —Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities(1859)The way media reports it, the Philippines is now a massive kill zone.Ever since President Duterte started delivering on his campaign promise to wage a war against drugs, reported drug-related deaths have increased. Hugely. Reports of unsolved alleged extrajudicial killings or EJK has become a daily staple of the news, triggering hysterics and indignation among the “so-called” guardians of human rights—best known by the acronyms US, EU and UN.Place yourself in the shoes of a killer, or anyone with deep-seated grudges against another, whether in business, inheritance issues, or passionate affairs of the heart. Now is the best time to eliminate the enemy and get away scot-free.Hire Killer. Eliminate enemy. Attach a sign “I’m a drug pusher…Don’t imitate me…”. Repeat.Problem solved. This crime is automatically labelled as an EJK. The yellow media jump gleefully and hysterically, like rabid dogs, and blame the ongoing war on drugs.Murderers are finally (and literally) getting away with murder. As a scholarly article argued: collective quarrel, honor killing, emotional dissatisfaction, lack of control of anger, and burglaries are the main reasons to commit murder. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors while designing preventive interventions at social levels to improve security levels.1Blame it on DuterteOpportunists are having a ball. Businessmen, lenders and borrowers, lovers… They know most EJK are left unsolved, so it’s easier to mix and muddle “normal” criminal motives into state-sanctioned EJK, in one of the greatest misnomers of crime reporting. Every crime victim the media unquestioningly (and contrary to their nature) add to the heap of carcasses laid at Duterte’s feet.As The Guardian reporter Kate Lamb wrote on October 4, 2016:“In the Philippines, they have a term for it: “salvage” victim. Someone killed and dumped in the street or thrown in the river. A corpse that is later salvaged. There have been many killings lately, the officer jokes, that these days you can easily get away with any kind of murder: “You can kill him, put masking tape on him and everybody is going to think that guy is a drug pusher.”Although she finds the allegations shocking, coming from a police officer, she asserts that “The Guardian can verify the policeman’s rank and his service history…there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder.”2The real culprits are silently laughing as Duterte’s detractors bite and swallow the hook, line and sinker of fabricated EJK. Labelling each death as an EJK is the best thing that ever happened to them.Extrajudicial Killing DefinedAtty. Al Perraño, a lawyer who has represented human rights legal cases, clarified the contextual framework of EJK:“Extrajudicial killings is defined by law as killings due to the political affiliation of the victims; having a specific method of attack; and where there are reports of involvement or acquiescence of state agents in the commission of the killings. As the term is used in international instruments, extrajudicial killings are killings committed without due process of law, i.e. without legal safeguards or judicial proceedings. Enforced disappearance on the other hand is defined as deprivation of liberty for political reasons committed by or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State. These are disappearances or abductions attended by an arrest, abduction, or detention of a person by a government official or organized groups or private individuals acting with the direct or indirect acquiescence of the government. It involves the refusal of the State to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the person concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty which places such persons outside of the protection of law. In this jurisdiction, extrajudicial killings are almost synonymous to political killings. It would appear that all extrajudicial killings are impelled by some form of political motive or agenda. Further, the usual victims of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances are political activists, journalists, or media persons.”3Labelling each unsolved murder, riding-in-tandem killing or death under investigation as extrajudicial killings or EJK does not seem to be included in the above definition, where the usual victims are political activists, journalists or media persons. This is why classifying the killing of drug lords and pushers as EJK is a really serious Freudian slip of the media, the modern age’s purveyors of “intellectual” opium for the information-hungry (and “uneducated”) masses.Clickbaits and social mediaSocial media thrives on clickbaits. Sensational and provocative headlines and photos are published to attract more attention than worthy news stories. Magnified way out of proportion with the cunning use of words and images, hoping to cause maximum damage against their targets, clickbait articles can reach the heights of cyberbullying frenzy and excitement (especially from cowardly trolls hiding behind legitimate-sounding, but non-existent, human rights groups…)The excessive distortion of news items leaves readers in doubt, especially when clickbait headlines don’t jive with the article’s contents. What these paid hacks and trolls don’t realize is that clickbait affects the quality and credibility of the news source, them included. The use of EJK (an acronym with a powerful ring to it, don’t you agree?) has become an example of clickbait to generate interest in stories against President Duterte’s war on drugs. People are getting tired of media sensationalism, which is why, as a Manila Times article recently reported, the House committee on Public Order and Safety proposed to drop the use of “extrajudicial killings” for the spate in deaths and, instead, refer to them as “deaths under investigation”.4While most media and websites have not dropped the use of “extrajudicial killings” or its acronym “EJK”, real murderers will continue to pounce on their targets with impunity and have Duterte blamed for it. It is not the President and his administration at fault here.Who is to blame? Duterte’s detractors. Their irrational hysteria, twisted emotions, political naiveté and lack of common sense, and their deep-seated indifference to the fates of those who suffer the consequences of the drug scourge merely created the perfect climate for true criminals to satisfy their twisted motives, animalistic survival instincts, and their astute sophistication in the affairs of the world.As a consequence, we can only predict that non-drug-related killings of innocent victims would also (if not yet) be on the rise.Citations:1.

"Dear PAO,I found out that my wife filed a case for legal separation against me. I am yet to receive and see the actual case but I want to know the grounds for the denial of a prayer for a legal separation. Also, I want to know who will have the custody of our minor son in case the legal separation case is granted. Please give us advice. Thanks.ShawnieDear Shawnie,In general, a petition for legal separation will be denied if your wife who filed the legal separation case failed to prove in court the grounds she mentioned in her petition. Although you did not mention in your narration the specific ground cited by your wife in her petition for legal separation, it is important to know that she, as the petitioner, will have the burden of proof in proving the existence of a ground to support her petition.More specifically, Article 56 of the Family Code of the Philippines enumerates other grounds for the denial of a petition for legal separation, to wit:“Art. 56. The petition for legal separation shall be denied on any of the following grounds:(1) Where the aggrieved party has condoned the offense or act complained of;(2) Where the aggrieved party has consented to the commission of the offense or act complained of;(3) Where there is connivance between the parties in the commission of the offense or act constituting the ground for legal separation;(4) Where both parties have given ground for legal separation;(5) Where there is collusion between the parties to obtain decree of legal separation; or(6) Where the action is barred by prescription.”Please note that with regard to the denial of a petition for legal separation because of prescription, the law requires that an action for legal separation must be filed within five (5) years from the time of the occurrence of the cause, otherwise it will be deemed prescribed. (Article 57, Id.)As to the custody of a minor child in case a legal separation is granted, Article 63 of the Family Code states that the innocent spouse shall be the custodian of any minor children but subject to further determination by the court when deemed necessary. Therefore, should your wife prove before the court that you gave cause for the grant of petition for legal separation of your marriage, the custody of your minor child will be given to her since she will be deemed as the innocent spouse.Again, we find it necessary to mention that this opinion is solely based on the facts you have narrated and our appreciation of the same. The opinion may vary when the facts are changed or elaborated.We hope that we were able to enlighten you on the matter.Editor’s note: Dear PAO is a daily column of the Public Attorney’s Office.

"Even as critics hail the suspension of the antinarcotics operations, the war on drugs appears to be continuing, leaving at least four dead and 62 arrested over the past two days.On the day the Philippine National Police announced the suspension, a holdup man on a barangay drug watch list was shot dead by unidentified men in Pasig City and 12 men involved in illegal drugs were arrested in Marikina City.These were the only drug-related arrests and death recorded by the Eastern Police District (EPD) from Monday evening to Tuesday morning.7,600 deaths so farApparently unaware of the EPD report, radio stations, which routinely cover drug killings, said there were no reports of any deaths in what appeared to be a rare bloodless night on Monday.More than 7,600 people, mostly users and small-time dealers, have been killed since President Duterte took office at the end of June, vowing to crack down on drugs.Human rights groups said extrajudicial killings were frequent, as were “hits” by assassins they said were linked to police. The PNP and Mr. Duterte vehemently refuted that.Between 6 a.m. on Monday and 6 a.m. on Tuesday, lawmen conducted 96 antidrug operations throughout the country, the PNP said on Tuesday.The operations were the last conducted by PNP following the announcement of the suspension of the antidrug drive.The PNP statistics showed 43,593 antidrug operations from July 1 to 6 a.m. on Tuesday compared with the 43,497 conducted as of 6 a.m. on Monday.The PNP chief, Director General Ronald dela Rosa, announced a temporary halt to antidrug operations on Monday to rid the ranks of “scalawags” after Mr. Duterte lambasted the PNP on Sunday for the kidnap-slay of Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo by rogue officers.Miss Universe effectAsked about initial reports that there were few drug suspects killed by the police or by alleged vigilantes in the past 24 hours, Dela Rosa said the vigilantes simply stopped doing their rounds because they knew the police would be able to focus on them.The PNP public information office head, Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos, said the few deaths on Monday until early on Tuesday could also be attributed to the festivities surrounding the Miss Universe pageant.Senior Supt. Edwin de Ocampo said the EPD had yet to receive a written directive from the PNP, but added that it had started following the President’s orders by refocusing the responsibilities of members of the district.“We will focus on serving arrest warrants and our anti-criminality operations,” Ocampo said. “Arrests will be coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Authority. There will be no buy-busts operations,” De Ocampo said.",1
"Jesus Catigan Insilada of Calinog, Iloilo is no ordinary teacher.A multi-awarded educator and writer, Insilada, member of the Panay Bukidnon indigenous group, introduced an innovative cultre-based teaching method and was named one of the 10 finalists, the only one from Asia, in the 2018 Global Teacher Prize which offers a US$1-million award.“I’m not claiming that I am the best teacher in the world, but there are a lot of possibilities for teachers to give quality education that is inclusive regardless of culture or economic background,” Insilada told the Manila Bulletin.No less than Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently announced the 39-year-old teacher from Calinog, Iloilo as one of the 10 teachers vying for the US $1-million fund from London-based Varkey Foundation.Culture-based approachAs the only Filipino and the only Asian finalist, Insilada is credited for introducuing a culture-based teaching method to students from the Panay Bukidnon indigenous group in the mountains of central Panay Island.Insilada, currently the principal of Caninguan National High School in Lambunao town, started his culture-based teaching method at the Alcarde Gustilo Memorial National High School in Calinog.A Panay Bukidnon himself, Insilada recalled that many of his students wanted to conceal their indigenous roots, fearing that they will be mocked and perceived as culturally backward people.“That’s what they thought. But gradually, I was able to convince them. They later understood how important it is to recognize their indigenous heritage and embrace it,” Insilada said.‘Hinilawod’ and ‘Panubok’Insilada drew inspiration largely from the Panay Bukidnon’s initiative to preserve the ‘Hinilawod,’ (Tales from the mouth of the Halawod River), an epic poem that dates back to pre-Spanish colonial period that depicts the war exploits of three brothers in the name of family and love.“This form of oral literature is used to teach poetic elements while illustrating the power of imagination by our ancestors,” he said.The innovatove educator likewise incorporated the panubok (traditional embroidery) that teaches mathematical elements of symmetry.The infusion of these cultural elements made it easier for Panay Bukidnon students to learn as they have an affinity to the concepts being taught inside the classroom.Whether or not he wins the US$1-million fund later this month, Insilada assures that he will continue to teach and espouse how education can be a way out of poverty and can uplift the dignity of marginalized communities.Super teacher and writerInsilada is a multi-awarded teacher and writer.He was named as Outstanding Teacher by the Department of Education (DepEd-Division of Iloilo) in 2008, Outstanding Teacher by Metrobank Foundation in 2014 and a recipient of the Princess Maha Chakri Award by the Princess Maha Chakri Foundation of Thailand in 2017.He bagged 1st prize honors for the Hiligaynon Short Story category in the 2015 Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature and the grand prize for the 2017 Writer’s Prize for Hiligaynon novel given by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA).He writes serialized novels for Hiligaynon magazine of the Manila Bulletin Publishing Corp.Education, education, educationWhile he has a doctorate degree, he is also the first in his family to finish college.He recalled growing up in a poor farming community and that his mother had to work as a house helper to augment the family’s income.But he knew that education was the key and studied diligently while enrolled at Alibunan Elementary School and Calinog Agricultural and Industrial College (now West Visayas State University–Calinog Campus) for high school and college.As a result, he was able to support the college education of his younger siblings.“It’s a cliché, but being an indigenous person or poor is not a hindrance,” he stressed.",1
"MalipotWith the addition of new classrooms, two public schools in Cebu no longer have to implement a shifting schedule.The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) recently donated buildings to San Nicholas Elementary School (SNES) and Zapatera Elementary School (ZES).Casino Filipino Cebu Branch Manager Ricardo Uy, who attended the turnover ceremonies of the school buildings, stressed Pagcor’s role in nation-building and its contributions to the education sector.“Pagcor’s school building project has helped many public school children get the quality of education that they deserve by providing them with better learning environment,” Uy said. “We are glad to have been a part of this noble mission to improve the learning condition – especially those in remote communities with no decent facilities.”San Nicolas Elementary School suffered extensive damage from the magnitude 7.2 earthquake that struck Cebu City in October 2013. Eight classrooms were destroyed, forcing the school to hold classes in morning and afternoon shifts.The new building houses 854 pupils from Grades 5 and 6.San Nicolas Principal Donald Crisologo said with the 20 additional classrooms, “we no longer have to implement a shifting schedule [and] all our students are now in whole day classes.”Built in 1927, San Nicolas has one of the biggest student populations for public elementary schools in Cebu City, with an enrolment of 3,191 pupils from Kindergarten to Grade 6, including Special Education (SPED) classes.",1

One of the prisoners is Bui Xuan Kim who was jailed for national security-related crime, according to Senior Lt. Police General Nguyen Van Thanh.Kim has served three years of his sentence for organizing people to flee to neighboring Cambodia.",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte’s admission that he used a powerful painkiller has prompted concern about his health, with lawmakers urging him on Sunday to undergo a medical examination and disclose the results.Mr. Duterte on Monday revealed that he used to take fentanyl, a drug often prescribed for cancer pain and other chronic ailments, because of a spinal injury from previous motorcycle accidents.The President, however, said his doctor made him stop using fentanyl upon learning he was “abusing the drug” by using more than the prescribed patches.The firebrand leader has attracted controversy for his brutal crackdown on suspected users of illegal drugs, which has claimed thousands of lives, and his incendiary language against the United States and the United Nations.The synthetic opioid is 50 times more powerful than heroin.Lawmakers said Mr. Duterte’s remarks revived speculation about his health, including rumors during the election campaign that he suffered from cancer—a claim Mr. Duterte repeatedly denied.“To end this speculation, it would be better if his physician explain how the President manages the pain that he suffers,” a Duterte ally, Rep. Carlos Zarate, told Agence France-Presse (AFP).Zarate added that a medical bulletin would clarify the state of Mr. Duterte’s health, as fentanyl became controversial after pop legend Prince died of an accidental overdose of the drug in April.Fentanyl, highly potent and addictive, is estimated to be up to 100 times stronger than morphine.An outspoken critic of Mr. Duterte, Sen. Leila de Lima, supported Zarate’s call.“It is not just the illness itself that we should be worried about, but also the impact or side effects that the medications he is taking may have, especially on his lucidity and ability to make decisions with a clear mind,” De Lima said in a statement on Sunday.State of health“Our Constitution is clear on this. The public should be informed of the state of health of the President in case of serious illnesses,” she added.“What if, God forbid, there is an emergency that requires immediate decisions, and the President is under the influence of such a powerful opioid?”Mr. Duterte, 71, has said he suffers from daily migraine and ailments, including Buerger’s disease, a cardiovascular illness characterized by inflammation of blood vessels usually due to smoking.He has cited ill health as the reason for skipping events during summits abroad. In Cambodia last week, he said he might not even finish his six-year term.Another critic, Sen. Antonio Trillanes, told AFP that Mr. Duterte’s admission that he took more than the prescribed fentanyl dosage showed he “qualified as a drug addict.”Mr. Duterte, however, has denied any addiction.“When there’s regularity, my friend, when you take it and when there’s a monkey on your back, that’s addiction,” he told a BBC reporter on Saturday.Regulated drugDoctors said fentanyl was regulated in the Philippines, with physicians needing a licence from the drug agency to prescribe it.“The ones using (fentanyl) are usually people with harrowing pain or terminal diseases. The doctor monitoring manages risks of addiction,” said Leo Olarte, former president of the Philippine Medical Association.“A medical bulletin is good so the public won’t be rattled,” he added.",1
"The Philippines reminds you of an oligarchy because it is an oligarchy.Whether all this has anything to do with colonialism is irrelevant: whatever happened in distant history cannot be changed, and besides the actors involved are long dead and gone. The only thing that Filipinos can change is their present and future, and they seem extraordinarily reluctant to do this.Tax money, broadly speaking, is just wasted. I believe this happens because Filipinos in general are absolutely hopeless with money. They have no idea how to use what they have to full advantage, preferring instead to whine endlessly that they don’t have enough. Give a 50 million peso budget to someone with that mindset, and he’ll just blow it on rubbish, since the uppermost thought in his mind is that it’s not enough to do whatever pie-in-the-sky project he really wants, so he might as well spend it on hookers and Johnny Walker.As for the submissiveness: I rarely, if ever, encounter this, but I’m aware that it exists. You’re probably right that it’s just kowtowing to someone who might be able to grant them favors. I hate people addressing me as ‘sir’ because the intonation (and accompanying behavior) is condescending. It is, paradoxically, disrespectful. I take it as a passive-aggressive thing. The problem is that the Filipino has yet to understand the distinction between Pride (ie., hubris, otherwise known as one of the seven deadly sins) and Self-Respect.Quite possibly this is all something to do with being conquered; but really, it’s time to get over it already. Instead of erupting in anger when foreigners (legitimately) criticize Filipino behavior, they could debate with those foreigners as equals and thereby gain respect. A challenge is not “control”. By becoming aggressively defensive every time someone flags up something important, they lose the respect they desperately crave.Duterte’s war on drugs, as I said, has resulted in every other problem the country faces being neglected. I’m not denying that the country doesn’t have a drug problem. It absolutely does. And quite frankly, when things get this bad, perhaps it’s time for a cull. But has anyone stopped to consider why? Let’s say Duterte kills all the drug dealers. What then? You have a new generation coming up who are being braindamaged by junk food and a nonsense-riddled education system, and when they leave school they’ll face a predatory State which prevents them from earning an honest living. Going out selling drugs is actually a rational decision: you don’t have to declare your activities to the BIR, for a start. Pinoys cheat and steal and defraud and prostitute themselves because illegal activities don’t attract any attention, while running an honest business puts you at risk of blackmail, imprisonment, or at minimum the huge expense of complying with complex and nonsensical laws and a punitive tax regime.Incidentally, while I broadly agree that there are a lot of scumbags washing up on these shores, there are a surprising number of good, honest, and smart people who actually want to make a positive contribution. However, because they ARE smart, they generally keep their heads down. Doing good in the Philippines is frowned upon, doubly so if you’re a foreigner.----------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment. Join the discussion",0
"Let me put the Philippine Economic and Political condition in a context of a typical Filipino household.The father is usually the breadwinner in the family, so let him be called the CAPITALIST.The mother is the sole administrator of all the father brings in, so let her be called the GOVERNMENT.They both take care of all the needs of their young son, so let their son represent the PEOPLE.The maid do all the household chores, so she may represent the WORKING CLASS.And their two-year old baby girl, let's call her the FUTURE.Now, here's the scenario:The young boy woke up in the middle of the night because his little sister is crying with no one attending to her. He then found out that her sister's diaper is wet and full so he went to his parent's room to seek help only to find out that his mother is sleeping soundly while his father is not in the room.He went to the maid's room instead which is tightly locked. but instead of disturbing the entire household by knocking hard on the door, he decided to peep inside through the keyhole and was surprised to see his father screwing their maid from behind.Desperate that he could not get the help he needed, he went back to his room, changed his sister's diaper and then went back asleep.This scenario can be summed up in a political context thus:While the CAPITALIST (father) fucks the WORKING CLASS (maid) the GOVERNMENT (mother) is sleeping.The FUTURE (baby girl) is in deep shit, and the PEOPLE (young boy) are left to fend for themselves.And that, my friends, aptly describes the political and economic conditions in our beloved land!------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"On the verge of tears, Sen. Leila de Lima yesterday bewailed President Duterte’s latest tirade against her, calling it an ill-timed “character assassination” just a few days before her Senate committee’s inquiry into the spate of killings in his brutal war on illegal drugs.“Somebody told me that just now. It’s very surprising. My first reaction now [is] I don’t want to dignify that,” De Lima told reporters at the Senate session hall during a break in yesterday’s proceedings.“It’s so foul, it’s character assassination. We are both professionals, the President and I. We are both public servants. I hope he doesn’t resort to those foul means. To me, that’s very foul,” said the neophyte lawmaker, her voice trembling.De Lima agreed to briefly speak to reporters, ironically just after jubilation at the Senate over the arrival of Olympic silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz.In his remarks in Camp Crame, Duterte blasted a certain “lady senator” for being an “immoral woman,” even accusing her of adultery. The comments, directed at a senator who was critical of the government, apparently referred to De Lima, the President’s staunchest critic in the chamber.“Wherever that came from, I hope it’s double-checked. I hope the source is verified, where it came from … . That’s really foul. I don’t want to dignify it,” she said.“And I did not expect the President to do that. That’s the truth,” she said of the man who stopped to shake her hand at Batasang Pambansa just before his first State of the Nation Address on July 25.In her privilege speech on Aug. 2, De Lima spoke of an apparently coordinated attack to destroy her as she pursued her human rights advocacy amid the President’s drug war.She said she wanted to cry then, but “I controlled myself. I don’t want to ever cry publicly.”Speaking to the Inquirer on Monday, De Lima expressed deep hurt for all the attacks against her, including those from the President’s supporters on social media.“I don’t respond to any of those. I ignore them. The best antidote is to completely ignore them. But it doesn’t mean I am not hurting. I am human,” she said.She said even her family had been hurt, including the elder of her two sons and her eldest grandchild, who are both special children.“My eldest is special, he is autistic. And then my eldest grandchild is also autistic, they’re special children. In all of these that’s been happening, I always think of them. They’re hurting,” she told Inquirer editors and reporters.Through all the attacks, De Lima said she just focused on “the words of encouragement, support and trust from people who matter,” among them former Supreme Court justices.",1
"Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV is confident that the Armed Forces of the Philippines is united and will not resort to extraconstitutional moves, but said the people’s voice of outrage could always prompt the military organization to take action.Trillanes, the mutineer-turned-senator who is facing arrest after President Duterte revoked his amnesty, said in a press briefing outside his Senate office on Friday that he never doubted the military’s loyalty to the Constitution.“The AFP is united. There may be differences in personal opinion but they are united. As far as loyalty is concerned, they are loyal to the chain of command and to their mandate, the Constitution,” he said.‘No crack’The senator claimed that the AFP did not want “to get caught up in this political exercise” because “it remains a professional organization.”“There’s no crack [within the military]. They may be conflicted but it doesn’t mean that there’s a faction. They are loyal to their constitutional mandate,” he said.Asked what it would take for the military to make a move, Trillanes said the people’s overwhelming voice of outrage was a possible game changer.“Just like what happened in Edsa 1 and Edsa 2, what they may be waiting for is the people, once they [become] so fed up and begin to speak [up]. We will never know,” Trillanes said.“History will tell us—that was what happened in Edsa 1 and Edsa 2. It [will be] palpable. You can feel it when the time is right,” he added.‘People power’Asked if he knew about any calls for “people power” to try to protect him, Trillanes said: “These things are out of my hands. As I said, it’s the people’s decision as to the limits of their patience.”The former Magdalo junior Navy officer claimed that some active military officers had expressed concern about Mr. Duterte’s revocation of the 2011 amnesty granted him by former President Benigno Aquino III.“They are hoping that they won’t be used in this political exercise of Mr. Duterte. They want to remain professional. That’s their concern,” he said.What is legalThe officers, he said, categorically support his contention that the President’s Proclamation No. 572, which orders the revocation of his amnesty and his arrest, was unconstitutional.Trillanes said the number of military officers who expressed their concern for his plight was “very significant,” although they could not express their support publicly.“They are aware of what’s happening in our country,” he said, adding he did not mean that the military officers would disobey the President.Mr. Duterte’s fierce critic does not see the need to communicate with the military’s top brass, who joined the President’s official visits to Israel and Jordan.“I respect them enough that I don’t need to communicate with them directly. I know that they know what is legal from illegal,” he said.‘Goalposts have changed’Former presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda lamented that the interpretation of laws had changed under the Duterte administration.Lacierda, a lawyer, cited as examples the ouster of former Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno from the Supreme Court and the revocation of Trillanes’ amnesty.“When I was still studying law, we were surefooted on what is the rule of law. Under this administration, honestly, the goalposts have changed,” Lacierda said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel.He explained that a Chief Justice could only be removed through an impeachment trial, but Sereno was removed through a quo warranto proceeding.In the case of Trillanes, he said the grant of amnesty could not be revoked anymore.Lacierda described as a “ridiculous proposition” the government’s reason for revoking the senator’s amnesty.“If there is an application form, there is an admission of guilt. It’s plain and simple,” Lacierda said.“It’s so funny. Their argument is just so ridiculous. Pardon me for saying this, but it’s a ridiculous proposition to say that the amnesty is void ab initio on the ground that there was no application form,” he added.Real enemyTrillanes’ ally, Sen. Risa Hontiveros, challenged the President to use his political will to fight inflation, and not the opposition, saying the rising prices of basic commodities are the state’s “real enemy.”“President Duterte would like to project himself as a toughie. If he’s really a tough guy, I challenge him to muster the needed political will to tame the country’s rising inflation rate,” she said in a statement on Friday.“The real enemy is inflation. The so-called strongman should get tough on inflation, not the opposition,” Hontiveros added.The attack on the Duterte administration’s critics was designed to mask the effects of inflation and divert public attention, she said.“Sorry, Mr. President, but it’s not working. The inflation rate is just too high for people to get distracted. Sound economic policies, not the assault on democracy, will address inflation,” she said.",1
"Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin today broke her silence over the BlackLivesMatter protests that led to the killing of five police officers in Dallas, Texas this week.Taking to her Facebook page, Palin says the Black Lives Matter movement is a “farce” and said Americans who hyphenate their racial backgrounds — such as African-Americans and Asian-Americans — “further divide our nation.”The former vice presidential candidate urged computer manfacturers in the U.S. to eliminate the hyphen from all keyboards as way to unite the country. “If there are no hyphens, then we won’t be seeing any racial divides,” she noted.",0
"A coalition of immigrant rights organizations across the U.S., acting on behalf of 11 million undocumented immigrants, today extended amnesty to former by a vote of 68-32 –a bill that would strengthen the borders while providing a path to citizenship to the country’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. The U.S. House of Representatives is now debating the Senate bill, but many conservative Republicans are not happy with the upper chamber’s version because it is tantamount to “granting amnesty to those who have violated this country’s laws.”In his statement, Bush said, “We can uphold our tradition of assimilating immigrants, and honoring our heritage of our nation built on the rule of law. But we have a problem. The laws governing the immigration system aren’t working; the system is broken.” He urged his fellow Republicans in Congress to address the issue as soon as possible. It wasn’t clear whether Bush’s urging will have any impact in changing the minds of lawmakers opposed to the path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Meanwhile, the Democrats in Congress have remained silent on the grant of amnesty to the former president. But sources said that while Democrats may not want to go as far as granting amnesty to Bush, they are also weary that opposing such move might jeopardize their standing with the Latino and other immigrant communities, especially in the next elections.As he posed for a photo with newly-naturalized citizens from Nigeria and the Philippines (see photo), the former president was asked for his reaction to the amnesty extended to him. He simply winked his eye and blurted out, “he he.”",0
"She was only 22 years old who died during a firefight between the Armed Force of the Philippines and the New Peoples Army on November 28 in Nasugbu, Batangas. Josephine Lapira was a former student of the University of the Philippines.She is known as an activist who regularly promote her political beliefs to women and recruited them to join her. She was the Secretary General of the Gabriela Youth.She was one of the 15 killed in the firefight.The AFP has retrieved personal belongings, guns, foods and grenades from the rebels. The fight broke when authorities received a tip that several rebels are on their way for an operation.Maj. Engelberto Nioda Jr., commander of the PAF 730th Combat Group, said authorities were tipped off to the presence of vehicles “full of armed rebels” in Nasugbu, 65 kilometers south of Manila.Delvo said joint police and military checkpoints were set up on the routes to Calatagan and Balayan towns after they received information about the vehicles.“We were expecting them to pass by that road, as that would be the usual exit route, but they instead took a turn and headed toward the direction of Tagaytay [Cavite]. There were also checkpoints there,” Delvo said.The authorities encountered two – an unmarked jeepney and a van – in the adjacent villages of Aga and Kaylaway, along the dimly lit part of the Tagaytay-Nasugbu highway.“The jeep did not stop [for inspection] and [the passengers] opened fire at our troops,” Delvo said.Meanwhile, CPP-NPA Chief Joma Sison is calling the Commission of Human Rights to investigate the killings of his 15 warriors.Your thoughts on this?

"Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales has ordered the indictment of former Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya and 16 others for graft for awarding P4.25 billion in contracts for the maintenance of Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT 3) to an unqualified and ineligible contractor in 2015.A statement released by her office said Morales, in a resolution approved on June 21 and released on Monday, found probable cause to charge Abaya and the others for violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.Lawyer Enricka Gonzalez, a spokesperson for Abaya, described the Ombudsman’s decision as “unfortunate.”“We have received the news through the media that the Office of the Ombudsman has decided against former [Transportation] Secretary Jun Abaya and his team,” Gonzalez said in a text message to reporters.‘Unsubstantiated complaint’“We find this decision unfortunate, considering that [Secretary Abaya] clearly laid out his defense against the poorly crafted and unsubstantiated complaint filed by the DOTr (Department of Transportation),” she said.Gonzalez said Abaya would consult his lawyers on his next step once he received a copy of the Ombudsman’s resolution.The finding of probable cause may be appealed before the Ombudsman files formal charges against Abaya and 16 others in the Sandiganbayan.The statement said a special panel of investigators had found that the respondents “extended unwarranted benefits, advantage and preference” to Busan Universal Rail Inc. (Buri) of the Filipino-Korean Busan Joint Venture (Busan JV) despite being “ineligible” and “unqualified.”It stressed that “Busan JV was not technically, legally and financially capable to undertake the MRT 3 long-term maintenance contract.”“Despite its being unqualified, the contract was still awarded to it by the DOTr, in violation of Section 53 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184, which requires that in negotiated procurement, the procuring entity should negotiate with a technically, legally and financially capable supplier, contractor or consultant,” the statement said.“By allowing the award of the contract to the Busan JV despite the attendant glaring irregularities, Abaya deliberately ignored applicable laws, rules and regulations, and standard operating procedures, falling short of or disregarding the required competence expected of him in the performance of his official functions,” it added.Ordered chargedThe other former transportation officials who were ordered indicted were Undersecretaries Edwin Lopez, Rene Limcaoco and Catherine Jennifer Francis Gonzales.The former MRT 3 officials ordered charged were General Manager Roman Buenafe, Assistant Secretary for Procurement Camille Alcaraz, bids and awards committee vice chair Ofelia Astrera, lawyer Charissa Eloisa Julia Opulencia, engineering division chief Oscar Bongon and engineer Jose Rodante Sabayle.Private citizens Eldonn Ferdinand Uy of Edison Development and Construction, Elizabeth Velasco of Tramat Mercantile Inc., Belinda Tan of TMI Corp. Inc., Brian Velasco of Castan Corp. and Antonio Borromeo, Jun Ho Hwang and Elpidio Uy of Buri were also ordered indicted.Cleared of any liability were former Transportation Secretary Mar Roxas and other Cabinet officials who served on the Government Procurement Policy Board—Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, Energy Secretary Carlos Jericho Petilla, Science Secretary Mario Montejo, Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin, Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson and Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan.Two complaints—separately filed by the DOTr and Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares and Bagong Alyansang Makabayan secretary general Renato Reyes—were resolved relatively quickly, as they were filed only in November last year.P4.25-B contractsA total of P4.25 billion worth of MRT 3 contracts were awarded to Busan JV, broken down as follows: P2.27 billion for the maintenance contract; P1.01 billion for the overhauling of 43 light rail vehicles; P900 million for the replacement of the signaling system, and P67.94 million for additional maintenance works.In October last year, the DOTr terminated the contract of Buri for failing to “ensure the availability of [a] contractually obligated number of trains, and more importantly, to put in operation reliable and efficient trains.”The decision came after a long string of service failures at MRT 3 that the DOTr blamed on the “poor performance” of Buri in maintaining operations at the Edsa metro.Reminder to everyoneThe Ombudsman’s resolution should remind everyone in government that graft is a serious offense, said Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the public services committee that inquired into unceasing problems at MRT 3.“While we lament that the same is bailable, let this be a lesson to everyone in [the] government that public officers are accountable for each and every contract that they enter into on behalf of the Filipino people,” Poe said.The Ombudsman’s findings, she said, tallied with the report of the Senate public services committee that blamed the MRT 3 troubles on the negligence and inaction of transportation officials.Poe said these lapses showed “insensitivity, callous indifference, and acts disadvantageous to the commuters, to the Filipino public and to the government with regard to the malfunction problem of the MRT.",1
"In an MSNBC commentary by Ari Melber, Facebook came under fire for allegedly allowing the proliferation of fake news in the U.S. and elsewhere. The piece focused on what Melber says is the social media giant’s support for ‘authoritarian’ governments like that of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.In that piece, Melber used quotes from Maria Ressa, CEO of the Philippine online news source, Rappler.Ressa, who has been desperately campaigning to “take back the Internet,” said that:Facebook needs to moderate its greed, clean up the toxic waste, and be accountable for its role as the new gatekeeper to information.Today, Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally responded to both Melber and Ressa. His response was short and sweet: “GO FACT YOURSELVES!”End of story.",0

"TOP security officials have urged indigenous Muslim leaders in southern Philippines to support the campaign against extremist groups that the government had vowed to wipe out by July this year.Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff Eduardo Año and commanders of Eastern Mindanao and Western Mindanao commands; commanders of the Philippine Army’s 1st, 6th and 10th Infantry Divisions and all battalion commanders in Mindanao met with the indigenous leaders during a three-day conference dubbed Mindanao Sultanate Summit on Peace and Security held recently.Also in attendance were some 450 Muslim traditional leaders from the various Sultanates of Mindanao.Describing the meeting as a first of its kind, Col. Edgard Arevalo, chief of the AFP Public Affairs Office, said, “This summit manifests our application of the convergence approach that is vital in defeating the Abu Sayyaf Group [ASG] and ensuring that vulnerable communities are protected from their violent ideology.”The ASG, which operates mainly in southern Mindanao, is a jihadist group linked to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria or ISIS.“By involving indigenous Muslim leaders in Mindanao, we are a step closer in dissolving the terror group’s mass base support and prevent them from recruiting new members,” Arevalo pointed out.During the conference, the Department of National Defense and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) agreed to partner with the group of Mindanao Sultans headed by Sultan Abdulaziz Salem Mastura Kudarat V, the 25th Sultan of Maguindanao.Besides extremism, also discussed during the meeting were poverty reduction, community policing, terrorism and violent ideology.They were followed by a series of workshops aimed at preventing the spread of extremism.Other security officials present were Philippine National Police chief and Director General Ronald dela Rosa, Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza, National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr., DILG Secretary Ismael Sueno and National Anti-Poverty Commission Secretary Liza Maza.“Aside from advancing the interests of and ensuring respect for traditional leaders in Mindanao, this summit is an opportunity for us to underscore their role in peace and security in the region,” Año said.“Terrorism and the spread of violent extremism cannot be solved by the military on its own. The active participation and involvement of the different stakeholders are a much needed help in ensuring the peace, security and development of Mindanao,” he added.",1
"The Philippines should seek the help of its friends in the Middle East in “repairing” strained diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Kuwait, Senate President Aquilino Pimentel 3rd said on Saturday.Kuwait recently expelled Philippine Ambassor Renato Villa over the rescue of distressed Filipino household workers in apparent violation of the Gulf country’s laws.“We have many friends in the Middle East. [We should tap them],” Pimentel said in a radio interview.“I think Saudi Arabia is the one closest to Kuwait. Or even Qatar. So, those two countries are close to Kuwait [in terms of diplomatic relations],” he added.Pimentel said, “[So, we can still ask for advice or help from them, if necessary].”Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano also on Saturday said the Philippines is currently engaged in discussions with Kuwait to address recent concerns “to answer the calls for help of a number of our kababayan [compatriots] who are working in Kuwait.”“In pursuing these discussions, we remain guided by the President’s [Rodrigo Duterte’s] policy that the protection of the rights and welfare of Filipinos overseas is paramount,” he added.The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Labor and Employment have been carrying out this policy by ensuring that they come to the aid of Filipinos in distress anywhere in the world, according to Cayetano.“The policy, and our resolve to pursue it, will not waver,” he said in a statement from Singapore where he was attending the 32nd Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Leaders Meeting.“We remain convinced that the actions we took in Kuwait are a rightful exercise of our duty under international law to protect our nationals abroad,” Cayetano added.He maintained that the government’s actions “are consistent” both with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.“We are committed to find a way with our counterparts in Kuwait to achieve our shared goal of strengthening our bilateral relations based on what we hope would be a common desire to ensure the well-being of our kababayan there,” he said.“If we reach agreement on this, the ties between our two countries would become stronger than ever,” Cayetano added.He requested “the kind understanding of the media and the public as we ask for diplomatic space while resolving these pending concerns with Kuwait.”",1

"President Duterte on Thursday said the Marawi battle against the Maute group and its allies—now on its fourth month—was on its final stage.Speaking to reporters here during a surprise visit amid protests denouncing his administration, Duterte said the operation was nearing conclusion.“The Armed Forces is winding up,” he said.Duterte said the crisis had dragged into weeks because of the presence of hostages, whose lives the military wanted to spare even as soldiers were dying in the fighting.At least 151 soldiers and policemen had died in the crisis that started on May 23, when government troops tried to serve warrants against Maute group leaders and Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon.“What delayed us before is just the same. As much as possible, we do not want any of the hostages taken by the terrorists harmed or killed,” Duterte said.No celebrationThe President also said that once the city had been fully liberated from the Maute group and its allies, no celebration would take place because “no one really won here.”Earlier, Col. Romeo Brawner, the Joint Task Force Marawi deputy commander, said at least 200 structures had not been cleared yet. These structures were within the less than 20 hectares of area where the gunmen had been pushed into.“We have expected to experience more firefights as we try to regain more ground,” he said.However, he said the military was also careful because of the presence of hostages—estimated to number between 40 and 45.On Saturday, government security forces captured two strongholds of the Islamic State-inspired militants during a major offensive, which also saw the rescue of captive priest Teresito Soganub and another hostage.The Bato Ali Mosque and the Jamiatu Marawi Al-Islamia Foundation were used by the gunmen as their command center.Armed Forces Chief Gen. Eduardo Año said the retaking of the two structures was not easy as soldiers had to fight the gunmen for about five hours.Año said the military viewed the recapture of the structures as “an enormous gain.”Joint Task Force Marawi chief, Brig. Gen. Rolando Bautista, said the military was expecting more areas to be captured amid resistance from remaining Maute gunmen, now being commanded by Omar Maute and Hapilon.Little resistance“We are ready for that. The AFP will press on relentlessly until conclusion,” he said.Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana also earlier said that the military was already close to retaking the city.“There’s only little resistance left. This is just one-half village wide. That’s why I’ve been told by my ground commanders that the end is near. Just a little more patience,” he said last week.The President also revealed that politicians were behind the Maute group and that they will also be hunted down.“How come the Maute and the terrorists were able to stockpile so much ordnance, bullets and improvised explosives device. The terrorists here (is getting funds from) them including politicians. Politicians here including in Central Mindanao,” he said.Duterte said he would lift martial law in Mindanao once the city had been declared safe from the terrorists.Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Melquiades Ordiales, the commander of the 1st Marine Brigade, said on Friday that Hata Lantud, the half-brother of Pantao Ragat Mayor Lacson Lantud, was among the five militants killed inside the main battle area on Sept. 15 and whose body had been recovered.“We only learned from Marawi community leaders that the slain militant was the brother of a town mayor,” Ordiales said.Ordiales said they also learned that the slain militant had been disowned by his family.",1

"TWENTY-SEVEN years after his death in Hawaii, the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos would finally be interred, if things don’t miscarry, in a place his family had been wishing for―in a manner that is quite typical of his deposed regime.The casket that would bear his preserved remains is made of bronze, purchased through the Philippine distributor of Aurora Caskets of Indiana in the United States, sources told the Inquirer.His remains have been lying in a glass-encased coffin (some claim he’s actually buried under it) at the Marcos Museum and Mausoleum in Batac City, Ilocos Norte.“It’s called an IFP Dark Brushed Bronze. It has pearl velvet interiors and gold-plated handles. It’s a full-couch casket. My guess estimate of its selling price is between $15,000 and $18,000 (about P690,000 to P820,000), excluding shipping and taxes,” the sources added.More money is being poured by the Marcos family for food, logistics and other expense items for a grand program of activities that is scheduled to start on Sept. 15-17 in Ilocos Norte and culminate in the burial on Sept. 18 at Libingan ng mga Bayani in Taguig City.The cemetery is reserved for Medal of Valor awardees, Presidents and other government officials, martyrs, artists and other citizens for “the inspiration and emulation of this generation and of generations still unborn.”The new bronze casket bearing the remains of Marcos may be opened for viewing at the family ancestral house in Batac this week, before the scheduled burial at Libingan.But officials of the Ilocos Norte government said this would depend on security measures they would implement to control waves of Marcos loyalists who are expected to come to bid farewell to the former President.TouristsPublicity surrounding the burial has drawn many tourists to the ancestral house where Marcos’ frozen body has been kept at the family mausoleum since September 1993.The house has been converted into a museum, so its caretakers have cordoned off the mausoleum.The Marcos family has stopped the release of new information on the burial preparations, in light of the security concerns.The municipal health office is discussing how best to facilitate the transfer of the body to Manila. Dr. Alicia Agbayani, city health officer, said her office was finalizing the release of clearances that would allow the body to be transferred to Manila.MorticianFrank Malabed, a mortician, has been maintaining the Marcos body since his death on Sept. 28, 1989, in Honolulu, Hawaii, where the family fled following the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution.On Tuesday, Malabed inspected Sta. Monica Parish Church in Sarrat town where the body would be taken after the commemoration of Marcos’ 99th birthday on Sept. 11.The body will be taken to St. Augustine Church in Paoay town before it is flown to Libingan on Sept. 17.Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI), which runs the Bishop Gregorio Aglipay Shrine across from the Marcos house in Batac, is also offering prayers for Marcos.Marcos, then 3 months old, was baptized by the IFI cofounder, Gregorio Aglipay. He was rebaptized as a Roman Catholic when he married Imelda Romualdez in 1954.Presidents against burialThe burial of Marcos was not permitted under the administrations of Presidents Corazon Aquino, Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Benigno Aquino III, either due to strong personal conviction or adverse public opinion, until President Duterte decided to honor his campaign promise that he would allow it on the grounds that “Marcos may not be a hero, but he was a soldier and former President.”Mr. Duterte’s decision was based on his own belief that the issue “has long divided Filipinos” and that it was now time to move on and have “closure.”But, instead, his statements have met strong opposition from various sectors. One form of protest was putting rocks with the names of the victims of the Marcos regime.Rocks of protest removedOn June 26, members of Bantayog ng Mga Bayani Foundation, Martial Law Chronicles, University of the Philippines Samasa alumni, Claimants 1081, and Nameless Heroes and Martyrs went to Libingan to place stones bearing the names of Liliosa Hilao, Edgar Jopson, Ninoy Aquino, Archimedes Trajano, Dr. Juan Escandor and Sen. Jose W. Diokno, among other victims of Marcos’ martial law regime, on the tyrant’s supposed grave site.The act also marked the launch of #bawatbato (each stone), a movement that Susan Quimpo, member of the Martial Law Chronicles Project, said “encourages others to do the same in different sites significant in the struggle against the dictatorship. These may include schools where many students were detained or killed.”Spruced upIn preparation for the burial of Marcos, workers have removed the rocks and started digging a grave in the Presidents’ section of Libingan.The Army spokesperson, Col. Benjamin Hao, said the sprucing up of the long idle open crypt started on Friday.Security was tightened as the planned burial of the late dictator was expected to spur protests.“The commander on the ground wants to maintain peace, solemnity and tranquility of the place. That will be disrupted if there will be rallies inside,” Hao told the Inquirer on Tuesday.Fenced offThe Army’s Grave Service Unit has also fenced off the burial plot.This will prevent protesters from putting stones or rocks, Hao said. The stones of protest have since been removed.He said the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office (PVAO) was the administrator of Libingan as it was the agency in charge of all national shrines with military and historical significance.Maintenance was devolved to Army units stationed near a historical site.“We just follow orders. On Friday, a civilian engineering company arrived. They said they have coordinated with the PVAO and they want to start the repair of the space. So, they were allowed to,” Hao said.Selda, an organization of former political detainees, on Tuesday called on Mr. Duterte to reconsider his decision to allow the burial at Libingan.“Despot Marcos, a murderer and a plunderer, is not a hero, and it is the height of historical revisionism to give him full national honors as a hero,” the group said in a statement.“The move, if pursued, constitutes another act of gross injustice to the nation and tens of thousands of victims of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, illegal arrests and detention, torture and harassment perpetrated by the Marcos fascist regime,” it added.ExtravaganceThe militant group Bayan slammed the extravagance of the solid bronze casket imported from the United States that is expected to be used in the interment, noting that it costs up to $30,000.“That act would stand out as another insult to Filipinos and a grim reminder of the Marcos regime of plunder and abuse,” said Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes.“The wealth illegally amassed by the Marcoses will again be used to ‘honor’ the late dictator in the same way it is used to whitewash his sins. State honors and the Marcos family’s ostentatious display of wealth are doubly insulting to the victims of the dictatorship,” Reyes added.",1
"“It’s not going to happen,” Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales said on Monday when asked by reporters if her office would initiate its own investigation of Sen. Leila de Lima.Morales cited a lack of firm leads establishing De Lima’s connection to the proliferation of illegal drugs at New Bilibid Prison (NBP) when the senator was justice secretary in the administration of President Benigno Aquino III.“Everything is just an allegation so far,” she said. “There is no lead that will prompt us to initiate an investigation.”Morales also noted that the Department of Justice (DOJ) had already started its probe of the two criminal complaints filed separately by the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption on Tuesday and former National Bureau of Investigation deputy directors Ruel Lasala and Reynaldo Esmeralda on Thursday.De Lima and other DOJ officials who served with her were accused of drug trafficking.The DOJ has convened an investigative panel composed of five prosecutors to look into the two complaints.“The DOJ should be given the opportunity to conduct a fact-finding investigation,” she said. “When the case comes to us, and if I believe the fact-finding investigation is exhaustive enough to merit our preliminary investigation if there is a crime committed, then we’ll go through it.”Normally, gathering evidence is done before the complaint is forwarded for preliminary investigation. The respondent is given the chance to counter the complaint before the state prosecutor determines whether there is probable cause for indictment, subject to the approval of the Ombudsman.One such case that can be tackled by the Office of the Ombudsman is the complaint filed by Chief Insp. Jovie Espenido, police chief of Albuera, Leyte province. In his complaint last week, Espenido claimed that De Lima received payoffs from suspected Eastern Visayas drug lord Kerwin Espinosa, who was arrested on Monday.Morales, however, said the complaint is yet to be forwarded by her Visayas office. “It has not reached us,” she said.In the House of Representatives, members of the justice committee, which conducted an inquiry on drug trafficking at NBP, appeared to be at loggerheads on whether their report should include a recommendation to prosecute De Lima. The panel met behind closed doors on Monday, and will resume deliberations today.Oriental Mindoro Rep. Reynaldo Umali, the committee chair, said at the weekend that it was unlikely the panel would propose the filing of criminal charges against De Lima, pointing out the hearing was in aid of legislation.Kabayan Rep. Harry Roque said in a press conference on Monday he disagreed with this position, stressing that De Lima “should be held liable for benefiting from the drug trade… and for coddling drug lords.”Convicted felons said they contributed to De Lima’s senatorial campaign in May in exchange for her protection. She has denied wrongdoing.Roque said these acts were in violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.“I understand why the majority wants to desist from such a recommendation because it wants to avoid the impression that the investigation was a witch-hunt against Senator De Lima. However, we are elected legislators and we took an oath to uphold the laws of the land. I believe it is incumbent upon the members of Congress to recommend the filing of criminal charges if we believe that our laws have been violated,” said Roque, a member of the committee.Roque said the Senate investigation of the P728-million fertilizer scam in 2004 recommended the filing of charges against then Agriculture Secretary Jocelyn “Joc-joc” Bolante.",1
"The United States ambassador to the Philippines on Tuesday said an additional $6 million through the US Agency for International Development (USAID) would be allocated to assist the most vulnerable members of the population in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur.Sung Kim said the fund would be used to help the children and the elderly who have been greatly affected by the five-month Marawi conflict that ended in October 2017.|He added that it would help in coming up with projects and plans that would really focus on the needs of the children and the elderly such as vocational training and other educational programs.The $6 million is on top of the more than $14 million earlier set aside by the US to help with the immediate needs in Marawi and also for longer term rehabilitation efforts.Of the $14 million or about P704 million, more than P150 million went to humanitarian assistance through the USAID’s Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance including the delivery of critical relief supplies such as safe drinking water, hygiene kits, shelter materials for evacuation centers and for programs to protect displaced women and children.Over P500 million was allotted for early recovery, stabilization and rehabilitation of Marawi and surrounding areas.“So we are already up to $20 million or over P1 billion and we are hoping to do more,” Kim said in a national television interview.Meanwhile, Taiwan has allocated at least P600 million as part of its humanitarian assistance to Marawi City.The amount will be divided in two parts, the first for construction of temporary shelters for affected families and the second for rice.Gary Song-Huann Lin, Taiwan’s Representative to the Philippines, said P60 million of the amount would be for construction of 400 transitional housing units while the remaining amount would be for three-year rice donation.The first donation was 1,680 metric tons of rice in 2017, and it will be followed by 4,400 MT in 2018 and 4,400 MT in 2019.",1

"Communist rebels led by Jose Ma. Sison and representatives of the Aquino administration have signed what was described as an “interim peace agreement” that may serve as a stepping stone to a permanent pact with the incoming Duterte administration.Members of a government delegation, sent by President Aquino in 2014 to The Netherlands to hold back-channel talks with leaders of the communist-led National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), gave the Inquirer a copy of the document, titled “Joint Agreement on the Resumption of the Formal Talks on the Peace Negotiations between the GPH (Government of the Philippines) and the NDFP.”The document bore the signatures of Sison and top NDFP negotiators Fidel Agcaoili, Vicente Ladlad and Danilo Borja, and members of the “secret” government delegation—Hernani Braganza, Jaime Aristotle Alip, Efren Moncupa and Francisco Lara Jr.A member of the government delegation said many officials involved in the talks were surprised that Sison signed the document, adding that the acknowledged founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) has not signed any document resembling an agreement with the Philippine government following the collapse of peace talks under then President Corazon Aquino.The delegations said the document, signed on Dec. 8, 2014, was a strong indication that the NDFP was not only willing to enter into a peace agreement but was also ready to embrace a life of peace for communist rebels, both armed and unarmed.READ: Joma Sison: Duterte victory good for national unityFrameworkAccording to the document, the parties agreed to:Reaffirm the 1992 agreement, called The Hague Joint Declaration, between the government and the NDFP, which became the framework for the start of formal peace talks, and specified that no conditions must be imposed on either party to start the talks.Accelerate the pace of formal peace talks by forming smaller “reciprocal working groups” that would hammer out political and constitutional reforms, end to armed hostilities and what to do with members of the CPP armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA).Draft and sign an agreement on “truce and cooperation” that would immediately lead to a cessation of fighting and would last depending on a timetable to be determined by the government and NDFP negotiators.Give priority, during the duration of the truce, to negotiations on a Comprehensive Agreement on Socioeconomic Reforms, which would list down the measures needed to achieve social justice, like a new land reform program and programs to bring about industrialization.Immediately convene working committees on social, economic, political and constitutional reforms that would give flesh to general agreements on social justice, economic equality and human rights. According to the document, the NDFP and back-channel negotiators set January 2016 as the target completion date for agreements on these issues.Virtual pactCopies of the document have been furnished President Aquino and the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process. The latest recipient of a copy of the document is Rep. Silvestre Bello III, who has been named by presumptive President-elect Rodrigo Duterte as head of the peace panel that would negotiate with the NDFP.According to a delegation member in the 2014 talks, the document is virtually a peace pact which needed only official imprimatur.“This is it,” said the member, who requested anonymity for lack of authority to disclose details of the 2014 talks.Another delegation member, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said what set the 2014 interim agreement apart from previous agreements is that NDFP “made a lot of concessions.”“They were not even calling for the release of all (rebel suspects), only those involved in the peace process,” said the member, who had taken part in talks with the NDFP under previous administrations.He said that while there was mention about the US government’s classification of the NDFP, CPP and NPA as terrorist organizations during the back-channel talks, this was not even discussed in the drafting of the interim agreement.“They (NDFP leaders) did not demand it (to be removed from the US terror list),” said the delegation member.READ: Joma Sison welcomes Dureza, Bello as gov’t peace adviser, negotiator with CPP-NPAAnother breakthrough in the 2014 negotiations, he said, is an agreement to hold marathon discussions to fast-track the peace process. “Like a conclave,” he said, referring to the process of electing a Pope.He said there would have been a “national, indefinite ceasefire” had the interim agreement been followed quickly by a formal signing.There was also an agreement to hold discussions by the smaller working groups simultaneously to fast-track the process. “Everything would be tackled in one fell swoop,” he said.The interim agreement has been shown to military officials, according to the source. “They were OK with it,” he said. “They did not revise anything.”The 2014 talks were described as a success compared to previous government attempts to restart formal discussions with the communist leaders.The delegation led by Braganza laid the groundwork for its trip to The Netherlands by talking first with communist leaders in the Philippines, among them NPA leaders based in Mindanao.Five tripsIt took five trips to The Netherlands before the interim peace document was signed, according to the sources.The back-channel talks took so much time that “so many Marlboros (cigarettes) had been puffed,” said one delegation member referring to how the negotiators spent break times.While the document signed by Sison and other NDFP leaders may be still a step away from a formal pact, it should be used by the incoming government negotiators as a take-off point. “This is already a good deal,” said one of the delegation members.“All that is needed is to make this formal,” he said.READ: CPP-NPA prepares list of nominees to posts in Duterte Cabinet",1
"Last month, The Adobo Chronicles reported that Oxford has added ‘selfitis’ to the English Dictionary after the word dominated social media for most of 2014. Selfitis is defined as “an inflammation of the ego” and refers to the obsessive compulsive desire to take photos of one’s self and post them on social media as a way to make up for the lack of self-esteem and to fill a gap in intimacy.Today, Webster’s announced that it is adding several new words to the 2015 edition of its dictionary for the American English language, thanks to the super storm that is currently pounding on most of the San Francisco Bay Area.The new words: Stormaggedon, Rainpocalypse and Floodgate.Stormaggedon and Rainpocalypse both mean the impending doom and destruction caused by a storm, typhoon or heavy rains. Floodgate (think Watergate or Irangate), a word entry that is already included in Webster’s Dictionary, takes on a new second meaning, and that is “a weather anomaly resulting in flash flood warnings that people receive on their mobile phones.”Congratulations to the Bay Area for its great contributions to modern language!",0
"Rodriguez, Rizal: Residents of a government housing site in Rizal, which an urban poor group tried to occupy on Wednesday, vowed to fight back if the group returns and adopted measures to secure the area.In a meeting between the homeowners’ association and officials, led by Senior Supt. Lou Frias Evangelista, Rizal provincial director; the National Housing Authority (NHA), and site developers, each family agreed to contribute P1,000 for a fence around the site and conduct regular patrols at night, and requested troops to stay “indefinitely” in case members of the Kalipunan ng Damayang Mahihirap (Kadamay) come back.The residents also noted the lack of electricity in the neighborhood although it was not clarified how the problem could be addressed.The Rizal Mobile Force Company said it would continue to watch over the neighborhood as long as the Kadamay threat remained.An unidentified resident said that Kadamay members should not force the NHA to give them houses, but should learn to comply with the system.“They are allowed to occupy the houses. There is no discrimination from the community wherever they may come from. The housing was developed for the police, soldiers, and the homeless; they would just have to go through the necessary screening and submit the documents for processing,” the resident said.He said the houses in Barangay San Isidro have been awarded to police and soldiers and that Joint Resolution 2, which Kadamay was using as basis to occupy government-built homes, was only applicable if there were vacancies.Signed by President Rodrigo Duterte on May 9, Joint Resolution 2 allowed the NHA to award unoccupied housing units by personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), and Bureau of Corrections (BuCor).Also covered were units whose ownership and possession were surrendered by awardees and respective awards were cancelled.The resolution cited the 2016 Commission on Audit (COA) report, which noted the low occupancy rate of completed housing units.Corporal Reytz Gordon Esparagoza, a resident, claimed that Kadamay members had no documents, making their occupation of the housing units illegal.He also said that these were not members of the urban poor group but were former residences of the South Bill BF Subdivision across the river who sold their houses.Apprised of the situation last Wednesday, Duterte gave Kadamay members until noontime on Friday to leave and warned them that he would not be responsible for the consequences if they refused.Interviewed by The Manila Times, troops and residents in the area said the militants had left even before Duterte’s warning.Gloria Arellano, chairman of the Kadamay group, said in a media interview on Wednesday that some members had applied for housing units through the Rodriguezlocal government unit and the NHA.“We are holding a rally to force them to act on our requests,” Arellano said.The Kadamay members who had barricaded the San Isidro housing site were those who applied for relocation based on a supposed Palace resolution to be signed by the President to provide affordable housing units to the poor, she said.",1
"The 5 ScenariosScenario 1: Duterte waives secrecy, Trillanes is wrong.Scenario 2: Duterte waives secrecy, BPI system has limitations.Scenario 3: No affidavit from Trillanes, Duterte refuses to waive secrecy.Scenario 4: Duterte waives, Trillanes is totally right.Scenario 5: Duterte waives, zero-sum transaction pairs found.Legal Representations(L)to Atty. Panelo, representing Duterte; (R) Sen. TrillanesThe Basic BangkoSerye TimelineSampalan ng Passbook sa Julia VargasInside BPI Julia Vargas: Panelo’s VersionThe Special Power of Attornry (SPA) document allows BPI to say whether there’s no P211 million whether singly, collectively, or cumulatively, in BPI account. BPI rep verbally said no in front of Panel and Trillanes. BPI accepted SPA and request to issue written certification, but BPI asked for 7 days to comply per company protocol, as it’s not standard practice. BPI standard practice is to provide data on outstanding balance but Panelo insisted that BPI issue a certification, based on BPI’s records. Panelo, in front of Trillanes, asked BPI if there has ever been deposits that amount to P211 million. BPI said “No.” Trillanes wants a copy of SPA. SPA already with BPI. BPI doesn’t want to give Trillanes SPA copy per bank secrecy law. Panelo said he can’t give SPA copy because he needs to ask Duterte first. Panelo told Trillanes that the latter can still read the entire document while they’re there. BPI told Trillanes they can’t just release transaction data per protocol, that they need to consult with BPI Legal. Trillanes gave Panelo a 2-page affidavit. According to affidavit, a Joseph de Mesa approached Trillanes, saying he (de Mesa) has an acquaintance who claims Duterte has many bank accounts. Panelo said this is not only hearsay on Trillanes’s part, but also hearsay on de Mesa’s. There’s an annex to the 2-page Trillanes affidavit showing alleged bank transactions. Upon examination, BPI said they don’t have such a form, that the list uses a custom-made, Non-BPI format. Panelo can’t release details because he’s not the bank. Panelo asked Trillanes if Joseph de Mesa is a real person or not, if Trillanes verified Joseph de Mesa’s identity. Trillanes insisted that Panelo refer to whatever is on the affidavit.Inside BPI Julia Vargas: Trillanes’ sideBPI did not show transaction records. Trillanes gave his affidavit, Panelo did not bring waiver. Trillanes asked help from accountants to tally and figure out how much money was deposited or transferred into the bank accounts, with final tally showing a total of P 2,407,272,103.75 that flowed into the accounts from 2006 to 2015. Trillanes said he got information from a Joseph de Mesa and “everything checked out”. Trillanes said he left bank after Panelo said he’s unauthorized to issue a waiver. Duterte never disputed Trillanes’ accusations. Duterte is a billionaire. Trillanes admitted that SPA requested for account balance and statement from bank deposit transactions never reached P211 million. BPI to take 7 days to issue written statement because SPA does not include signature from Sara Duterte, who holds the account jointly with Duterte. Ombudsman and related agencies immediately investigate these kinds of issues. Trillanes claims Duterte’s threats to form revolutionary government with NPA leader Jose Maria Sison is real. Duterte’s demands for authentication of document is just for courts, and Trillanes “will get there.” Trillanes received his information only on April 21st, hence the delay.Page 1 of 2Page 2 of 2Let's AnalyzeThinkingPinoy can still remember the first time he watched “Legally Blonde”, where he first heard Aristotle’s line, “Law is reason free from passion.” Now that pretty much the entire country is agitated with #BangkoSerye, I think it’s time to evaluate the situation with pure logic and zero emotion.Let’s go.In the previous 2-part ThinkingPinoy article “ #BangkoSerye: 5 Scenarios in Monday's BPI Julia Vargas Meet ”, TP explained five possible scenarios in yesterday’s “sampalan ng passbook” event in BPI Julia Vargas. The scenarios were:Interestingly, what actually happened on Monday appears to be a hybrid of Scenarios 1, 2, and 3.Confusing? Don’t worryTo do that, let’s first list down all relevant information.Duterte was represented by Atty. Sal Panelo, a legal heavyweight. That is why TP, along with several other netizens, were confused as to why Trillanes did not even bring a lawyer with him.Panelo also serves or has served as chief legal counsel for punta-ka-condo-dala-u-food Cedric Lee [ ABSCBN ], the Ampatuans [ MB ], and Bong Revilla [ ABSCBN ].Only legal geniuses will have the guts to defend those three. And there was Trillanes, all alone to fend for himself.Trillanes is not very smart.But let’s set that aside for now. Now, let's have a quick recap of the BangkoSerye timeline.– Trillanes accuses Duterte of not declaring P211 million in his 2014 SALN [ Inquirer ]. Trillanes provided the Inquirer with a spreadsheet showing 9 transactions on a BPI Julia Vargas account and 1 transaction on a BDO account. Trillanes alleges both accounts are jointly owned by Duterte and daughter Sara. A copy of the spreadsheet is shown below:– Trillanes says P211 million just a part of massive underdeclaration, withholds release of additional evidence pending “validation by accounting” [ Inquirer ].– Ellen Tordesillas’s friend goes to BPI Julia Vargas, deposits P500. Deposit slip consummated [ ET ].– Trillanes to quit senate if charges proven false [ Inquirer – Duterte admits existence of 2 BPI accounts, claims outstanding balances are less than P17,000 and P50,000. Agrees to sign waiver if Trillanes executes sworn affidavit detailing allegations [ Inquirer ].– Trillanes expands accusations, says Duterte had P2.4billion in transactions in 17 accounts over 9 years [ Inquirer ].– Trillanes clarifies he needs transaction details for past 9 nine years, says nothing about executing an affidavit [ Inquirer ].Sen. Antonio Trillanes and Duterte’s legal counsel Atty. Sal Panelo both arrived in BPI Julia Vargas at before 11am yesterday. Media personnel and non-clients were not allowed inside the bank [ ABSCBN ].Trillanes brought with him a sworn affidavit while Panelo brought a “waiver” in the form of an SPA, or special power of attorney, allowing him access to Duterte’s bank records.A couple of hours later, a stern Trillanes emerged, walked straight to his vehicle, granted no interviews, and advised media to attend his press conference at the Magdalo headquarters.Panelo exited the BPI building afterwards and granted interviews to media personnel waiting outside the bank. Part of the interview is shown below:In the interview above, Panelo said several things:Moving forward, we will be citing Panelo’s first point as [D1], the second [D2], and so on.Moreover, here’s a screencap of Panelo’s one-page SPA:An interview with Trillanes is shown below:In another interview, Trillanes said the following in relation to the BPI Julia Vargas “confrontation” [ GMA ].Let TP list down everything Trillanes said relating to BPI Julia Vargas.Thinking Pinoy tried to find other statements from Trillanes but the news articles contain the same information. [ Manila Standard ], Philstar Tempo ].Moving forward, we will be citing Trillanes’ first point as [T1], the second [T2], and so on.Now, here’s a screencap of Trillanes Affidavit:Now, the next thing TP will do is analyze information from both sides.But this article is too long already, so TP will do that in #BangkoSerye: Impeachment after Sampalan sa BPI Julia Vargas?

"a positive sign of economic progress in this city, Vice Mayor Vianca Venzon Gozon has called for the preservation of the environment.Speaking during the recent opening of the Westfields Residences, one of the housing projects Businessman Ronnie del Rosario, president of Cresta de Oro Phil., Inc., Gozon appealed to property developers to involve the communities in preserving, protecting and maintaining a clean environment in the city.Citing the acute need for housing, Gozon lauded Del Rosario for contributing to the solution in the shortage in housing in Bataan.Westfields Residences is located on the provincial road in Barangay Tuyo, a strategic location near the heart of the city which is just a walk away from two landmark fastfood chain branches here, the four-lane highway, and the Central Terminal.Since its conversion into a component city, Balanga has become progressive with the sprouting of commercial establishments, access roads, big number of employment and the prevailing peace and order.

"Who’s afraid of “The Punisher?”Definitely not the equally feisty Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales, who dismissed on Thursday as loose talk the warning of presumptive President-elect Rodrigo Duterte that he would execute corrupt public officials and dump their bodies in Manila Bay.“Those were just his wisecracks during the election period and that’s what clicked. I think people wanted to hear something different. It’s a phenomenon that he made,” she told a news conference.“He being a lawyer, I know he will observe the rule of law,” Morales said.But the usually tough-talking Morales sounded rather tame when replying to questions about Duterte who, she admitted, was related to her through her brother, Davao Regional Trial Court Judge Lucas Carpio.Lucas Carpio is the father-in-law of Duterte’s daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, who was elected as mayor of Davao City.Morales, a retired Supreme Court justice, surmised that Duterte’s controversial statements, which raised not a few eyebrows during the campaign, “attracted people who voted for him.”“But whether he would actually implement them remains to be seen,” Morales said.The country’s top graft buster also sought to assure the public that the Ombudsman would pursue its investigation on the plunder case filed by Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, a losing vice presidential candidate, against Duterte regarding his alleged hiring of “ghost” employees.Immune from suitMorales, however, said her office could only investigate and not prosecute Duterte since he would be immune from suit once he is sworn in as President on June 30.She said the Ombudsman would just forward the results of its investigation to the Congress since a sitting President may only be unseated through impeachment.“Under the law, the Ombudsman will still continue investigating an impeachable officer only for the purpose of determining whether gross or grave misconduct has been committed,” she said.Morales, who will step down from office in August 2018, also expressed confidence that Duterte would not dare dip his hands in the affairs of the antigraft body.“I think he knows that I’m impervious to influence. He will not try to interfere with my work,” she told the Inquirer.But as in the other cases involving the Duterte family, Morales said she would inhibit herself from all investigation proceedings involving the incoming President.“I think relationship is not a factor in the disposition of cases or in the investigation of cases,” she said. “[Duterte] has been very vocal about fighting corruption. I don’t see any reason why he should renege from his announced plan of running after corrupt government officials.”Morales said there was nothing wrong with Duterte’s statement that he was not keen on pursuing the prosecution of Vice President Jejomar Binay and President Aquino.“He’s not the prosecutor so he’s right,” she said. “It is the Office of the Ombudsman that initiates charges or, if it does not motu propio file charges, receives complaints and gives due course to complaints if warranted.”The Ombudsman has recommended the filing of graft charges against Binay in connection with the alleged overpriced construction of the Makati City Hall Building II when he was the mayor there.Calls have also been made for the prosecution of Mr. Aquino for plunder in the alleged misuse of congressional pork barrel funds.Morales said her office planned to pursue the case against Binay at the end of his term when his immunity from suits expires.As to whether Binay would be jailed or not, Morales said: “If the charges are bailable and he posts bail, he will not be incarcerated. But if the charges are nonbailable and the evidence is strong, whether or not he will go to jail would depend on how the Sandiganbayan, or any court for that matter, determines.”Frivolous, baselessBinay’s spokesperson Rico Quicho said in a statement on Thursday that Morales had not been fair with the Vice President.“She had ignored evidence, due process and the law to harass Vice President Binay while she turned a blind eye on the complaints against the allies and party mates of the current administration,” Quicho said in a statement.He said that in a fair and impartial venue, the cases against Binay would be dismissed “for being frivolous and baseless.”“We shall exert all legal remedies to prove the Ombudsman wrong,” Quicho said.

"President Rodrigo Duterte is not alone in drawing fire for what critics call breach of ethics and abuse of authority by soliciting a kiss from a married Filipino woman in South Korea on Sunday night.Hours after television images of the President’s kissing scene with migrant worker Bea Kim sparked public anger on Monday, a video posted by a Duterte administration critic, Jover Laurio of Pinoy Ako Blog, went viral on the internet, showing Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade leaning forward as if to kiss a female member of his staff.Tugade is a close aide of the President. They are both graduates of San Beda College in Manila.“Seems like obscenity has become normalized during President Duterte’s term,” Laurio wrote in the caption for the video, which had drawn nearly 2,500 comments as of press time on Tuesday.Just like Malacañang, which has been defending the President’s behavior as just “a playful act accepted in Filipino culture,” the Department of Transportation (DOTr) found itself pushing back against public criticism of Tugade’s action.‘Just for fun’Goddes Libiran, DOTr communications director, said the video was from a mouth relay parlor game during the Christmas party at the department in 2016.Tugade was shown with food between his lips that he intended to pass to the female employee, Libiran explained.She said Tugade’s action was “just for fun, nothing personal.”The employees, she added, “cheered and nominated other pairs to participate in a [fun] and lighthearted moment.”“We find it unfortunate and rather sad that known critics of the administration had to pull an old video of Secretary Tugade having clean fun with employees and put malice where there is none,” Libiran said.",1
"Television host Steve Harvey has bigger things to worry about than a repeat of his error in announcing last year’s Miss Universe winner. When he arrives in Manila to again host the international beauty pageant this month, he will be met by a protest of one million Filipino men.Harvey came under fire this week for mocking Asian men.During a segment on his eponymous talk show on Monday, the 59-year-old comedian made fun of several self-help books, including one titled “How to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide for Asian Men.”“Excuse me, do you like Asian men?” he asked the audience. “No thank you.”He then suggested a new book title, “How to Date a Black Woman: A Practical Guide [for] Asian Men.”“That’s one page too!” He says. “‘You like Asian men?’ I don’t even like Chinese food. It don’t stay with you no time … I don’t eat what I can’t pronounce.”In reacting to Harvey’s mockery, one million Filipino men will picket the Mall of Asia Arena, venue of the Miss Universe pageant finals on January 29 (January 30 Manila time)A spokesperson for the Coalition of Real Filipino Men (CRFM) said that one of the group’s demands is for Harvey to issue an apology on live television, just before he announces the new Miss Universe. The group also hopes that this time, he will announce the correct winner.",0
"La Union 1st District Rep. Pablo C. Ortega recently said that the judiciary will play a key role once the death penalty is restored.“Judges should study carefully that those who will be charged with heinous crimes will be investigated properly. They should study well if the accused deserves the death penalty,” Ortega said.Ortega, a member of the majority bloc, said he is in favor of the death penalty as long as it will be implemented and amended properly.“I am for the death penalty but there are some amendments that will be made to ensure that only those who deserve to be meted with death sentence will be punished,” he said.Ortega said that majority of the Congressmen in the ruling coalition are in favor of the death penalty, provided some amendments are made.“We conducted a majority caucus to hear the different views of the Congressmen and what their proposals are for amendments so that the bill will be implemented properly,” Ortega said.Ortega discounted the pronouncement of Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez that members of the majority who are against the death penalty bill would be ousted from the coalition.“That’s not true. The speaker just wants clarification from opposing members for their proposals for amendments,” he said.Alvarez, a staunch ally of President Duterte, is determined to have the bill passed on 3rd and final reading before the 17th Congress takes a break on March 18.Ortega said he is not in favor of the inclusion of plunder in the death penalty because it is sometimes being made as reason for political revenge.",1
"FireEye, an intelligence-led company, on Thursday disclosed that cyber attacks mounted on Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, for several years already were sponsored by the governments of China and Vietnam.Travis Reese, FireEye president, told reporters in a news briefing that the cyber attacks have tremendously affected operations of governments, private companies and even the media.Reese said the attacks, which began in 2013, gave huge economic benefits to China and Vietnam.Apart from economic advantage, the cyber attacks also gave huge political and business advantages in terms of understanding the whole government and trade movements of various countries, including the Philippines, according to Bryce Boland, FireEye’s chief technology officer for Asia Pacific.He, however, refused to reveal details.Boland said groups engaged in cyber espionage have been aggressive in carrying out their attacks in order to have better gains each year.He cited as an example the Conference Crew, which was founded in 2016 and has since expanded its operations early this year against critics of public and private institutions in seven countries, including the Philippines, where it collected important and strategic information that it will use for the interest and advantage of China.Boland said the Conference Crew sponsored by the Chinese government has increased its attacks on the defense and banking industries, financial services, telecommunications, consulting and media.The Conference Crew attack on the government is “predominantly [focused] on national security and diplomacy.”Boland also cited Vietnam’s state-sponsored APT 32, which started its cyber espionage operations in the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries in 2013.He said the group hit several governments, business firms and even a number of journalists.APT 32’s operations continued until this year during which it raised its attacks on the Vietnamese diaspora and the Philippines, according to Boland.What is alarming with these cyber attackers is that they continuously improve their espionage tools in carrying out their operations against their targets in order to get better and important information, he said.Reese said this problem on cyber operations has been brought up with various governments and private institutions.According to him, the Philippine government and business firms are very much “cooperative” with FireEye.Reese said government officials and business leaders should be “careful in how they divulge” the information to the public so that the cyber attackers would not get vital information that they will eventually use to carry out their cyber operations on the governments, including the Philippines, and business firms.He also cited the strategic importance of the media, which has been a big help in disclosing the cyber attackers’ dirty job.Boland warned that the attacks would continue in the next few years.",1

She, however, has not criticized her fellow senators and members of the House of Representatives who also support the restoration of the death penalty.It seems Santos believes that respect is a one-way street, and is reserved only for women.",0

"A Brief RecapThe Vindictive Cory AquinoCory’s misplaced idealism... or stupidityCory’s Foresight (or the lack of it)The Age-old LNMB Burial IssueNoynoy OK with Marcos’ Medal of ValorUPDATE (3 PM 19 Nov 2016):DONT FORGET TO SHARE!RELATED POSTS:I sincerely respect the outcry of some people against Ferdinand Marcos’ Libingan ng mga Bayani (LNMB) burial, such as UP Prof. Sarah Raymundo and Dra. Lorraine Badoy: I agree with most of their points.What I do not agree with or at the least, what I do not respect, is the stance of my Aquino-aligned friends on the burial issue, for the simple reason that their “leader” — the Aquino Political Dynasty — doesn’t give a shit about Marcos’ LNMB burial anyway.Let me tell you why.In my August 2016 article “ Marcos in LNMB? Lena really is a terrible lawyer ”, I explained how the mostly Liberal Party-led government of the past thirty years neglected to fix the “legal loophole” that made Marcos eligible for burial in theIn that article, I explained that former President Cory Aquino herself gave her imprimatur on the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regulation enabling the Marcos burial which was, interestingly, penned by AFP Chief of Staff Fidel V. Ramos, the same person who succeeded Cory in 1992. I also explained how the Aquino Political Dynasty neglected to fix this “accident” for the next 30 years.The Aquinos gave us two presidents (Cory, Noynoy), four senators (Noynoy, Butz, Bam, Tessie), and a horde of muti-term congressmen, of which Noynoy was also a part of. Despite this, none of them — not even one of their politicial minions — managed to even do something to revise the AFP regulation in question.In response to a tweet related to the previous paragraph, Ambassador-designate Teddy Boy Locsin told me, “It is hard to explain why something was not done; easier why something was done. Cory was not vindictive to look that far.”What’s the problem with this statement?“Democracy icon” Cory Aquino, at least while still president, was actually vindictive.In 1989, Philippine Star columnist Luis Beltran wrote that Cory “hid under the bed” amidst a coup d’etat, Cory retaliated by filing a libel suit against Beltran. Beltran and Star profusely apologized, but Cory rejected these apologies. Cory, as the President, even took the witness stand during the libel hearings. Eventually convicted, Beltran was jailed for half a year as a result [ Teodoro 2003 ].No forgiveness despite grovelling apologies resulting to Beltran’s imprisonment? That sounds like a vendetta to me. Saying “Cory wasn’t vindictive.” will make Journalist Chito Beltran’s journalist father Luis Beltran roll in his grave.But this is just a libel case, right? Well, there’s another, much better example.In 1989, a dying Ferdinand Marcos spoke to Vice-president Salvador Laurel. He said, “Please tell Mrs. Aquino to stop sending me her relatives. They are proposing and asking so many things. All I want is to die in my country…I will run over 90 percent of all my worldly possessions to our conversation to our people. I ask only 10 percent for my family [ Laurel 1997 ].”Marcos gave only one condition when he added, “Just let me die in my own country. I want to be buried beside my mother [ibid].”Cory refused to receive Marcos’ message [ibid]. Yes, Cory didn’t even let Marcos die in his own country which to me, isn’t really too much to ask, especially since it defies logic.If that is not vindictive, I don’t know what else is.Marcos only asked for 10 percent, while the government’s agent — who was trying to recover Marcos assets — was asking for twice that amount.In 1986, Cory gave her blessings to Operation Big Bird, where Credit Manila President Michael de Guzman was supposed to recover the Marcos assets stored in Swiss banks, with de Guzman receiving a 20 percent commission for whatever loot was to be recovered. The plan was a complete failure after it was aborted, owing to conflicting viewpoints among government decision makers [ MS ].The Philippine government did not recover any money from Operation Big Bird and it was even subjected to a congressional investigation years later [ Chaikin 2000, p. 11 And thirty years later, we are still going after the same assets. What if Cory just used common sense in 1989, would we still be having this problem today?Let’s go back Locsin’s statement, that Cory was not vindictive to look that far.I have clearly explained how Cory has actually been one vindictive son of a gun, but I am inclined to agree with Locsin that Cory lacked foresight.Cory was never a politician prior to her presidency. She actually was less qualified than opposition leader Laurel, but Laurel stepped aside because of EDSA fever. At that time, the public felt that “a vote for Cory would be a vote for Ninoy… a vote for what Ninoy represented in death [ Brands 1992, p. 330 ].”That is, even it it’s quite possible that Marcos didn’t order Ninoy’s death [ TP: Marcos didn’t kill Ninoy? ], as witnesses pointed to Cory’s cousin Danding Cojuangco as the mastermind. Too bad the possible star witness, Ninoy assassin Pablo Martinez, that guy who can actually implicate Danding, was “killed in a road accident” in 2014 [ TV5 ]. But I am digressing.For the sake of argument, let’s just assume that Locsin is partially right. Let’s assume that Cory neither had the IQ nor the experience to look that far into the future, that the possibility of Marcos’ burial never entered her mind.There are several issues with this alibi:With the knowledge that former presidents have been buried in LNMB, it would take a lot of stupidity on Cory’s part for the idea of a Marcos LNMB burial to evade her. And if that idea didn’t evade her brain, that would mean Cory thought a Marcos LNMB burial wouldn’t be a big deal, and perhaps you know what that means.Shortly after assuming office in 1986, Cory took every step to erase all traces of Marcos throughout the country [ Time ], essentially an attempt to diminish whatever Marcos’ positive achievements were. Surely, Cory cannot have such a short attention span: Marcos’ 1989 death should have reminded her that “Oh shit, he may get buried there!”Res ipsa loquitur (Latin for ""the thing speaks for itself"") is a doctrine that basically says accidents imply negligence. That is, the accident that was Marcos’ eligibility for LNMB burial is a result of negligence, and negligence it was.But for now, let’s give Cory a pass. Let’s just say she’s just incapable of foresight, period. Instead, let’s focus on what the Aquino Political Dynasty has done, post-Cory presidency, to rectify this oversight.The fact of the matter is that the “law” that enabled Marcos’ LNMB burial is just an AFP regulation, something which can simply be superseded either by a simple request from the AFP Commander-in-Chief who happens to be the President, or if not enough, an Executive Order.Two Aquino presidents, Cory and her son Noynoy, came and went, and not a single effort was taken to do either.But let’s assume that the Cory and her progeny are all idiots, so let’s check whether Ninoy’s legistator-relatives did anything about it. After all, sans a presidential order and if such an LNMB burial really is a big deal, then the legislature could have done something about it through a law that expressly forbids a Marcos corpse in LNMB land.Ninoy's brother Agapito “Butz"" Aquino, who was a “pillar of the anti-dictatorship movement” and also a senator from 1986 to 1995, did did nothing about it [ TV5 ].Ninoy’s sister Tessie “ Dancing Queen ” Aquino-Oreta, a congresswoman from 1987 to 1998 and a senator from 1998 to 2004, did nothing either.Benigno “Bam” Aquino IV, Ninoy’s grandnephew who milked the Ninoy likeness for all it’s worth, also did nothing in the three years that he’s been in the senate. Bam was elected Senator in 2013.The same goes for Ninoy’s cousin Jesli Aquino-Lapus, who was Tarlac 3rd Dist. Representative from 1998 to 2007, and for Ninoy’s uncle Herminio Aquino, who was the representative of the same district from 1992 to 1998.Yes, none of them gave a Rat's Ass about the LNMB dilemma.Yes, none of the Aquinos — the people who should have been most invested in influencing the historical trajectory of the Marcos narrative — gave a shit.But wait! There’s more.Just to demonstrate further that the Aquinos gave no shit about Marcos’ LNMB burial, it is to be recalled that Ninoy’s own son, PNoy, allowed Vice-president Jejomar Binay in April 2011 to decide on whether Marcos should be buried in LNMB or not [ GMA ].Yes, Noynoy delegated what’s supposed to be a crucial task to Jojo. Yes, Noynoy used the LNMB issue as a political booby trap for Mar Roxas’ likely rival in 2016.Yes, Noynoy didn’t want to have a say on it. He wanted Binay to decide.What’s worse? There’s something else that happened on that same day .In reference to the AFP Medal of Valor awarded to the late Ferdinand Marcos, Aquino Deputy Spokesperson Abigail Valte in 2011 said, “These awards continue to be on the official roster of awards of the AFP. Until otherwise revoked, the awardees continue to receive appropriate recognition [ TV5 ].”Valte never retracted this statement, and no one in PNoy’s Malacanang — including PNoy himself — even attempted to downplay, let alone retract, Valte’s statement.What does that mean? That means PNoy himself recognizes Marcos’ eligibility for a Medal of Valor award.And what happens to Medal of Valor recipients? I don't know how what kind of semantic acrobatics the yellow camp will use to get out of this, but Medal of Valor awardess are technically heroes, you know.Case in point, Medal of Valor awardees are included in AFP’s Hall of Heroes [ Star ]. Yes, even before the LNMB burial and since the Medal of Valor award in 1968, Marcos has already been included in the AFP’s Hall of Heroes -- and the Noynoy Aquino was OK with that.I do not recall any protest in the past 30 years regarding the same.Yup, nobody in the Aquino Family -- even the blabbermouth Kris Aquino -- spoke against it.And by the way, where can Medal of Valor awardees be buried?In the Libingan ng mga Bayani [ ABS ].Holy shit. [ ThinkingPinoy The Medal of Valor is not just an AFP award. It is awarded by the State itself. Even presidents have to salute to MoV awardees. But I guess the Aquinos didn't mind that. Susmarya.Did you like this post? Help ThinkingPinoy stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help!",0
"This post will be a bit shorter than usual. It’s quite noticeable that many people (esp. in Facebook) just read the title and hastily jump to react and issue comments without even bothering to read the actual article itself. Yes, that’s the sad reality (lack of time or sheer laziness) – and it’s quite easy to prove.For anyone who just reads the title without even peeping into the article content, you will readily notice their comments to this article will be in violent rabid protest – even branding the author to be a Yellow freak. But then the more disciplined minority will hopefully step in to rebuke these “fake readers”.The reason why many posts in Facebook are just meme posters with big bold letters is that it is increasingly difficult to get people’s attention nowadays. There are probably just too many ads, news feeds, faces and even garbage out there all crying out for the horde of potential traffic to click, like, love and share.So long for that long introduction. Now to the meat of the article. Well for most readers here at GRP who have gotten accustomed to anything issued by the Zaxx-man, things are not always what they seem. Yup, I did like watching the Transformers even in my younger days… esp. listening to the “more than meets the eye” line of the theme song.Why this seemingly sudden shift in tone? Well one thing’s for sure – I’m definitely not for allowing the incompetent Yellows having their cake. Duterte is a political strategist, and a cunning one at that – someone whose moves can hardly be anticipated by most people.While so many DDS and pro-Duterte supporters simply abhor Leni, the “fake VP”. Duterte actually shows respect for the lady – even addressing her “Ma’am”. That’s where the mystery kicks in.Why then in anyone’s wildest dreams will having Duterte step down to make way for Leni do any good for the country or his legacy as a president? Well for one, I really can’t imagine Congress to approve a bill calling for capital punishment for corrupt officials. Did you guys see that picture circulating in socmed about how in China, about two dozen corrupt officials were being lined up to be executed by firing squad? Well that’s never gonna happen in the Philippines simply because of some chicken-egg situation, UNLESS…The only real way to change the country from the top is by a complete overhaul of its laws. How long will it take for the guys in Congress to come up with a new Federal constitution which Duterte promised to the people? Probably as long as it took to give him emergency powers to solve traffic in Manila. Knowing the guy, he simply does not have the patience for long-playing dragging drama. He wants things done expediently. And when that wick runs out, we can expect something very drastic to take place – all to the surprise of unsuspecting Filipinos.Other than stamping out drugs, Duterte’s only other real agenda is Federalism. After almost 2 years, it’s still making its baby steps in the halls of Congress. Is Duterte really going to wait this out? So here’s the plan. There’s a high probability Duterte will suddenly step down one of these days, and all hell will break loose. Imagine the scenario that takes place…Duterte steps down. PET is not yet finished with the Bongbong vs. Leni electoral protest. Leni is about to get crowned (by virtue of the Cory constitution) as Yellow queen of the land Yellows rejoice in jubilant victory. Duterte supporters flood the streets in protest/rallies. The military sides with the people (as in EDSA I) We all wake up one morning under a new Federal Republic of the Philippines (with a brand new constitution). Duterte’s annointed sits to reign in his place.Well we’re not saying this is going to happen. It’s just that the probabilities are pretty high, considering the slow progress taking place in granting Mr. Daddy D’s promise of a Federal state to our Moro brothers in the South. Now just keep testing the guy’s patience and we’ll see.So does the article’s title still make this author a piece of Yellow crap in sheep’s clothing?",0
"President Rodrigo Duterte took a defiant stand against the United States subtle threat to embargo all foreign aid to the country in protest against his lethal war against illegal drugs.‎In a speech Thursday, Duterte dared the US to go ahead and cut its assistance to the Philippines because he would not heed US President Barack Obama’s advice to do his police operations the right way.Duterte said he would be the first to go hungry a first to die of hunger in his fight to keep the dignity of the Philippines from what he perceived as bullying ans undue interference from the US.‎We have a problem here trying to preserve our society and you (US) mess it up human rights? Tinatakot niyo pa kami. Assistance, assistance ano paningin nyo sa amin? How do you look at us? Mendicants?

"THE TWO feuding members of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) skipped exchanging dramatic barbs to beat the deadline in lodging another comment in the Supreme Court on Sen. Grace Poe’s second pleading to reverse the poll body’s ruling to disqualify her from the presidential race in May.Comelec Chair Andres Bautista said the comment concerning the Second Division’s decision was sent Monday afternoon following an en banc session that allowed all commissioners to give their opinions and affix their signatures to the document.“The [draft] comment was circulated by Commissioner Arthur Lim to the members of the en banc, we were given an opportunity to read [it] and [provide comments],” Bautista later told reporters.But as to the comment filed by Election Commissioner Rowena Guanzon on Thursday in the high court, Bautista said the full commission would be dealing with the issue in another en banc session today.Bautista had claimed that Guanzon docketed the comment without clearance from him or the full commission.On Friday, the Comelec chief issued a memorandum directing Guanzon and Maria Norina Tangaro-Casingal, director of the Comelec’s law department, to explain within 24 hours “under whose authority” Thursday’s comment was filed.Guanzon fired back, insisting that only the full commission, not Bautista, can say that the comment she filed was “unauthorized.”But Bautista and Guanzon’s first meeting Monday at the en banc session on the heels of the controversial filing of the comment on Thursday was unexpectedly devoid of angry confrontation.Cordial meeting“It was a very cordial [meeting]. There was a lot of give and take of their opinions… . That’s what we saw this morning. There was a lot of mutual respect about the varying opinions and eventually they came up with a document that they are all happy with,” said Comelec spokesperson James Jimenez.In a press briefing, Jimenez said all seven commissioners, including Bautista, signed the comment on Poe’s pleadings in relation to the poll body’s Second Division ruling after giving their respective opinions on the matter.He also said Guanzon’s comment was touched on very briefly since the full commission gave priority to craft the other comment that needed to be docketed at the high court before Jan. 12.“The top agenda of the en banc meeting today (Monday) was to draft a comment that will be agreed upon by all the seven commissioners,” Jimenez said.In a separate interview, Bautista said the full commission would try to clarify the protocol in filing pleadings and documents with the Supreme Court during today’s en banc session.“Meanwhile, I also want to say that projecting the Comelec in disarray is not accurate. We are just having a misunderstanding on the process of filing of pleadings that’s why we want it clarified in the en banc meeting tomorrow (Tuesday),” he added.The Comelec chief also explained that during their Jan. 5 en banc meeting, after the Office of the Solicitor General declined to represent the poll body in the Supreme Court, Guanzon was tasked to draft a comment for the First Division ruling and Lim for the Second Division decision.BiasHowever, the commissioner did not circulate the draft comment. Bautista said the en banc was open to releasing documents, such as the minutes of the meeting, and the audio recordings of the Jan. 5 en banc session if called for.In an ambush interview with reporters, Guanzon expressed confidence that the issue would be settled soon and that “all will be well with the Comelec.”“I’m very positive that this issue will be settled once and for all,” she said.But on her Twitter account earlier Monday, Guanzon wondered why Valenzuela City Mayor Rex Gatchalian, a spokesperson for Poe, and recently Sen. Francis Escudero, Poe’s running mate, were “immediately talking for Bautista.”She also insinuated that Bautista was biased for Poe: “Bautista three times met the commissioners to insist we consolidate all Grace Poe cases. He voted in her favor. Grace Poe lost. He delayed the issuance of the resolution until Dec. 23.”Guanzon also challenged Escudero to lawyer for Poe and prepare for a face-off at the Supreme Court.“If you are such a good lawyer, why don’t you lawyer for Grace Poe? See you in the SC,” she said, apparently in reply to Escudero’s calling her a “threat to democracy.”CeasefireSpeaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. and other House members are urging the Comelec to stop fighting in public and resolve their differences in-house to preserve the poll watchdog’s impartiality at a crucial point in the election season.“I suggest that they should get together and get their act together,” Belmonte said.ACT Teachers Rep. Antonio Tinio said Bautista and Guanzon should settle their differences internally because their public bickering was not doing the Comelec any good.“If they continue this, the Comelec’s capacity to administer the elections in a nonpartisan manner will be further eroded,” Tinio said.Ako Bicol Rep. Rodel Batocabe said that while it was not unusual for a collegial body to have disagreements, the Comelec officials should know better than to wash their dirty linen in public.“Should this controversy persist, so much so that the credibility and reputation of the Comelec will be extremely prejudiced, then that is the only time we can discern who among the commissioners should be culpable for impeachment,” Batocabe said.

" Even in this difficult time, evacuees and fans of boxing superstar Sen. Manny Pacquiao will not be missing his highly anticipated match against virtually unknown Australian slugger Jeff Horn on Sunday.Pacquiao, who announced his “retirement” from boxing in April after defeating American boxer Timothy Bradley by unanimous decision, would be facing Horn at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane today.And his fans here, including evacuees staying at the social hall of the provincial capitol, would be able to catch the live telecast after Lanao del Sur Vice Gov. Mamintal Adiong Jr. ordered the installation of cable television, said Zia Alonto Adiong, spokesperson of the local crisis management committee.“We would like to make them happy even for a moment only,” Adiong said, adding that he counts himself as a fan.Maranaos were among Pacquiao’s biggest fans and among the 15.2 million voters who sent the boxing legend to the Senate during last year’s elections.Bombay Lininding, an evacuee from Moncado Colony here, said he had not missed any of Pacquiao’s fight.“I would even stop taking passengers during his fights,” said Lininding, a tricycle driver.Lininding said Pacquiao, a reserved military officer, still packed a killer punch even at 38.The 29-year-old Horn—who never fought outside of Australia—was considered “unheralded” as he lacked any signature victory defining his career.He goes against Pacquiao, an explosive ring veteran who parlayed his fame into a successful career in entertainment and politics. Sunday’s match is believed to be a warm-up bout for Pacquiao, who has reportedly set his sights on a rematch with fellow ring legend Floyd Mayweather, who had once beaten him.No free viewingBut even then, Suncorp Stadium was expected to pack an excess of 50,000 fans for the fight dubbed the biggest in Australian boxing history.As for soldier-fans, Lt. Col. Jo-Ar Herrera said those who were assigned inside the provincial capitol here might be able to watch the live telecast inside the social hall.But for those out in the field or assigned at the military headquarters just across the capitol compound, there will be no free live viewing for them, he said.A military officer said the free viewing for the soldiers outside of the capitol might not really happen as they had more important things to do.“I believe our troops have no more time for that. It is luxury enough that they get sleep, even how short it is. We can’t even take a decent bath most of the time here at the rear, how much more for those who are on the front line,” the officer said.The military has been battling the Maute group and its allies since May 23. As the fight dragged on, 82 soldiers had already been killed. The Maute group, which suffered 303 deaths since, was also being blamed for the deaths of 44 civilians here.In Iligan City, Vice Mayor Jemar Vera Cruz said the security situation in the city might not be conducive for a large crowd gathering, which was why they have not thought of sponsoring a live view of the fight.Hundreds of displaced Marawi residents had sought refuge in Iligan since the outbreak of violence, forcing officials to place the city on high alert status.There would also be no government-sponsored viewing in Cotabato City—where security concerns were also high.Pacquiao fans elsewhere, however, would have a chance to view the fight live.In Digos City, Mayor Joseph Peñas said the free viewing would be at Almendras gymnasium.In Sultan Kudarat town in Maguindanao, Mayor Shameem Mastura said the local government also sponsored free viewing.In Buluan, Maguindanao, Gov. Esmael Mangudadatu—a big Pacquiao fan himself—said the provincial government would sponsor a free live viewing event.",1
"With just three days before Christmas, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE 13) Regional Director Evelyn R. Ramos reiterated her call for private employers to release their workers’ 13th month pay.The official issued the appeal during the Regional Coordinating Committee (RCC) meeting and its last media briefing for this year.She renewed the call for employers to immediately release their workers’ 13month pay after learning that there were still some who have yet to comply with general labor standard.“We appeal to them to pay their employees and workers now,” stressed the DOLE 13 official.In the same forum, the official ordered the region’s legal department, including those in the provincial and city labor offices, to conduct an investigation on employers who will not comply with the law.Ramos said all employers are mandated by law to pay their workers their 13th month pay on or before December 24, regardless of the nature of their employment and irrespective of the methods by which their wages are paid, provided they worked for at least one month during a calendar year.The Labor Code provides that every covered employer is required to make a report of compliance with the law to the nearest DOLE regional office not later than January 15 of each year.The 13th month pay is defined to mean one-twelfth (1/12) of the basic salary of an employee within a calendar year, she said.",1
"Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. on Sunday cautioned Vice President Jejomar Binay against treating in a cavalier manner the allegations of kickbacks, ill-gotten wealth, bid rigging, use of dummies and money laundering against him because these could be verified or confirmed by the public.Binay has dismissed the corruption allegations as part of a demolition job against him because of his announcement that he would run for President in 2016.“The charges against Jojo are formidable and provable. He should not brush them aside as dirty politics,” Belmonte, a vice chair of the ruling Liberal Party (LP), said in a text message.Belmonte noted that Binay’s ratings, based on the latest Pulse Asia survey, had dropped by nearly half from a peak of 41 percent in June 2014 to 22 percent early this month.The Vice President’s ratings slump coincided with the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee’s long-running probe of Binay, his family and his cronies, which began in August last year with the allegedly overpriced Makati City Hall Building II.The probe expanded to other allegations of corruption against Binay when he was Makati mayor, such as the construction of the Makati Science High School building, the deal between the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (BSP) and Alphaland Corp. to develop the BSP’s one-hectare property in Makati, the security and janitorial services firm that was given contracts by the Makati government, and a 350-hectare agricultural estate in Batangas province.Binay reacted to the drop in his once sizable rating as a “wake-up call.”Belmonte said Binay should look deeper into what the surveys were telling him. “Polls are not static. They change from time to time. What is important is the trend and how to sustain or reverse them,” the Speaker said.While Binay’s numbers have declined, those of Sen. Grace Poe have surged—from 12 percent in June last year to 42 percent this month.Belmonte expected the political heat to shift from Binay to the junior senator as the deadline for filing of candidacy neared.Everybody’s target“Grace will be everybody’s target,” said the Speaker, whose political party is wooing Poe to be part of the administration ticket in next year’s general elections.Belmonte does not see Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte as much of a threat because of his declaration to kill all criminals and to abolish Congress.“Is Digong (Duterte) serious? Is that the way to run a country?” Belmonte asked.Duterte has emerged as a serious contender in next year’s polls with a 15-percent rating.Belmonte said Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, the presumptive standard-bearer of the LP, was “moving up.” His rating jumped from 4 percent in March to 10 percent early this month.Roxas is tied in fourth place with former President and now Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada.No effectCaloocan Rep. Edgar Erice, Roxas’ most vocal backer in the LP, said an endorsement from President Aquino would give Roxas the boost needed to catapult him to the top.But Sen. Serge Osmeña earlier said that the President’s endorsement would have “almost no effect” on voters based on the last four presidential elections.In a text message, Erice said Poe’s rise was understandable given that she had become a “darling of the press.”Erice said the only takeaway from the survey results was that the presidential race was far from settled.“The numbers reveal that everything is volatile. One valid issue may cause a dip. People are answering based on their heart’s sentiments. But when the elections come near, they will use their minds,” Erice said.The lawmaker, however, pointed out that Binay’s presidential ambition was “doomed” as the drop in his ratings had been consistent since last year.Erice expected Duterte to drop out of the race to protect his turf in Davao City while he believes that Estrada’s 10 percent share was “[up] for grabs.”Poll doubtedLakas-CMD cochair and former Quezon Rep. Danilo Suarez cast doubts on the accuracy of the Pulse Asia survey results.“I can’t see how Grace can beat VP Binay, especially in Luzon and the class D segment. It’s also surprising that Binay has a bigger share in the AB segment than Poe,” Suarez said in a phone interview.National Unity Party secretary general Reginald Velasco said Poe’s lead was encouraging but it was by no means a “sure thing.”Binay’s drop was not “irreversible” as he still has a year left to rebound, Velasco said.“Only VP Binay has declared [his plan to run for President] among those cited in the survey. Once the posers are weeded out, we will know for sure the real pulse of the public. That will probably come in the first survey after the deadline for the filing of candidacy in October,” Velasco said.He said both Roxas and Duterte still had a chance to climb in the surveys should they officially run for President.–With Inquirer ResearchRELATED STORIESBinay on alleged ill-gotten wealth: I have nothing to returnIt’s another work of fiction, says Binay campRELATED VIDEOS",1

"AlavarenThe Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is considering filing charges against leaders of transport group Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (PISTON) for destroying tow trucks accredited by the agency during a transport caravan yesterday morning in Manila.MMDA Spokesperson Celine Pialago said that MMDA legal department is now studying what appropriate charges to file against PISTON President George San Mateo after some of his members allegedly destroyed the tow trucks they deployed during the caravan along Espana Boulevard.“We can file charges against the leader of the group, but we are still studying the charges to file against them,” Pialago said.The agency deployed the tow trucks along Espana Boulevard on Monday to remove the public utility jeepneys illegally parked along the highway.While MMDA and tow truck crews were about to tow away the illegally parked vehicles, transport members smashed two of the 10 tow trucks, prompting them to back out and suspend their operation.The protest caravan developed after Piston cancelled their scheduled transport strike following the appeal of Senator Grace Poe, who promised their grievances will be tackled on Thursday.However, Poe has moved the Senate Committee on Public Services’ scheduled hearing on the government’s jeepney modernization plan to next week to accommodate Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade who would be busy this week due to a prior engagement.Tugade, who was present during the congressional oversight committee on Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), was asked if he would be able to attend the hearing on the planned modernization of public utility vehicles which has been moved to Monday, Dec. 11, instead of Thursday, December 7 as originally scheduled.Despite the cancellation of the transport strike yesterday, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board still dispatched private buses to ferry passengers affected by the transport caravan rally staged by various militant groups.LTFRB member and spokesperson Atty. Aileen Lizada said yesterday that they have prepared at least 31 vehicles and 22 private buses for the passengers who will be affected by the transport rally.Lizada added that their Joint Quick Response Team is activated for the whole day to assure that no “surprises” will affect the riding public even if Piston leader George San Mateo announced on Sunday the cancellation of their supposed two-day nationwide strike.

"Congress will suspend the fare rate increase implemented Sunday in the Light Rail Transit (LRT 1 and 2) and Metro Rail Transit 3 (MRT) systems if the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) fails to justify it at a committee hearing scheduled for Jan. 8, even as protesting commuters took matters into their hands by staging a protest on a moving LRT-2 train early Sunday.“If there is really a need for us to ask for a deferment, we will do it, we will ask for it,” said Catanduanes Rep. Cesar V. Sarmiento.He said Congress could opt for a full deferment or implementing the fare hike on a staggered basis.At least two senators on Sunday castigated the DOTC for the new LRT-MRT rates, which are roughly double the previous rates and went into effect 15 days after they were announced while Congress was on a holiday break. The House and the Senate sessions will reopen Monday, Jan. 5.Selfie protestAbout 10 members of the militant Strike the Hike consumer group, stylized as #StrikeTheHike, refused to hold on to safety handrails, sit or stay still, all the while taking selfies on a Santolan-bound LRT-2 train, to protest what they said was the “unjust” fare increase.Holding greeting card-sized thumbs-down signs patterned after Facebook’s ubiquitous “like” button, the young protesters first posed for selfies on the platform of the LRT Pureza Station, before boarding a train heading toward Santolan. The group continued to take selfies and even managed to convince a few passengers to pose with them.Mark Louie Aquino, the Strike the Hike Network spokesman, said the selfie protest was just one of the creative ways the group has thought of to protest against the LRT and MRT fare hike.“We encourage our fellow Filipinos to create protest actions in any forms. For the selfies, we hope they post them to Facebook with the hashtags #NoToMRTLRTFareHike or #StrikeTheHike,” he told reporters.“We will do more protests on Monday, and seek a temporary restraining order from the Supreme Court, and if the government will not listen, we will make more noise,” he said.‘Treacherous’Aquino said that the fare hikes were “treacherously” implemented after the Christmas holidays to minimize opposition.“At this time, when there have been many expenses over the holidays, and with 70 percent of LRT and MRT riders either minimum wage earners or students, this [fare] hike is an awful surprise,” he said.Citing various news reports, he noted that the government itself has said that the additional profits from the increase would not benefit the system.“In previous years, the government said the increase will go to improvements in the system. But now, (Transportation Secretary Jose Emilio) Abaya himself said that the money from the increased fares would just go back to the private firms involved in running the trains,” Aquino said.Sympathy from passengersPassengers who agreed to have their selfies taken with the protesters were sympathetic.“It’s okay for me to spend more on LRT fare, but this is just too much,” said Aurora Chua, 57, who commutes from Marikina to Binondo to her workplace. “If most of my daily wage goes to my fare, then life will be more difficult for me.”Others seemed more surprised than angry.“I normally pay P15 to get from Santolan to Recto, but now, I have to add P10 more,” said a 19-year-old female student, who declined to be identified. “The price hike was surprising, but it seems we can’t do anything about it.”After getting off at Gilmore Station in San Juan, the group of protesters then crossed the tracks going in the opposite direction, without buying new tickets for the journey.They repeated this act, highlighting a ripped portion of the protective rubber joint of a part that connected the train wagons.The antifare hike sentiment spilled over to Twitter, with users such as @maxell_lander tweeting, “LRT, MRT fare hike starts today—What?! This gov’t is in the pits, rewarding bad service and corruption by fare hike, shame on you all!”Another user, who goes by the handle @_ChristianDale_, said, “Long queues, disrupted operations by stalled trains, not functioning escalator and elevator, and filthy toilets, NO to MRT/LRT fare hike!”Fare hike OKOther users, meanwhile, defended the increase, saying that train fares in the Philippines are way lower compared with rail fares in other countries.“Ayos lng sa ibang bansa na nasa $2 or P50 to P100 ang bayad (The hike is okay, because in other countries, rides cost around $2 or P50 to P100 each),” said user @HooverMon.Twitter user @seantwenty said it’s about time the government hiked fares: “Well aside from the ‘sudden’ implementation, there’s really nothing wrong (with the fare hike). Gov’t has been subsidizing, fare not increasing in years.”“There’s nothing else to do but feel indifferent. Because no one is really going to stop the hike!” said Twitter user @JGDelica. “Nobody’s really going to give a s–t about how we feel.”Congressional oversightSarmiento said the hearings on the fare rate hike formed part of the congressional oversight function over the DOTC and of Congress’ duty to protect the public interest.Officials of the DOTC, LRT, MRT and Philippine National Railways have been invited as resource persons to the House hearing.Sarmiento said he would defer any opinion on whether the fare hike was justified or not till after he had heard both sides. “Some sector would say that the fare increase is probably high time but then again, given the circumstances of chronic glitches, some might say it is untimely,” he said.He cautioned though that there was a difference between the state-owned LRT and the MRT, which was built and leased to the government by a private group.Sarmiento said the confusion over the fare rate hike, specifically accusations of lack of public consultations, should serve as an eye-opener for Congress on the lack of a dedicated government agency regulating train fares.Abaya, Abad to be confrontedSenators Grace Poe and Francis Escudero on Sunday said they would confront Abaya and Budget Secretary Florencio Abad on the “treacherous” increase at the resumption of the Senate public services subcommittee hearings into the MRT’s problems.“That’s one of the issues we will ask of them. If there’s still a way, we can try to stop, and ask for their commitment to suspend it,” Escudero said.Otherwise, only the public, not the Senate, has the power to stop the fare increase by petitioning the court, the two said.Escudero and Poe accused the DOTC of putting one over the public by enforcing the fare increase during the holidays.They said the increase was ill-timed as Congress had already approved allocations for the MRT and LRT in the P2.606-trillion 2015 national budget, and that the MRT has yet to fix its glitches.No reason for hike“I don’t see any reason to increase the fare, financially and practically. As to its benefits for the commuters, there’s no basis,” Escudero told dzBB radio, noting that the government did not hold public hearings before announcing the increase.“It’s sad to think, but it appears they did something treacherous,” Poe told dzBB in a separate interview.“They have very bad services, and then they announced the increase while the public was on holiday, and they couldn’t go to court,” she added.Escudero, who heard the budgets of various agencies as finance committee chair, said transport officials never mentioned the fare increase during the budget hearings.Support for increaseAmid the backlash from angry commuters, Malacañang touted the expressions of support from its congressional allies representing districts outside Metro Manila not served by the LRT and MRT systems.Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. on Sunday rattled off the names of the supporters, noting that they were “elected directly by our people.”“That’s why we also have to recognize that there are also a lot of groups and sections of our population who agree with the increase in LRT and MRT fares,” he told the state-run Radyo ng Bayan.Coloma cited Representatives Ben Evardone (Eastern Samar), Rufus Rodriguez (Cagayan de Oro City), Oscar Rodriguez (Pampanga), Rodolfo Fariñas (Ilocos Norte), Eric Singson (Ilocos Sur), Cesar Sarmiento (Catanduanes) and Joaquin Chipeco (Laguna).Malacañang earlier noted that it was unfair for taxpayers outside of Metro Manila to contribute to the LRT and MRT subsidized fares when they did not use the trains. With the new round of increases, the government is hoping to reduce its subsidy from P12 billion to P10 billion.False hopesMilitant groups led by the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) will question the increase in the Supreme Court Monday, a move Coloma said the Palace respected.But he appealed to the protesting groups to keep protests orderly and not to disrupt traffic.Cavite Rep. Elpidio Barzaga Jr. said militant groups were just giving “false hopes” to commuters by filing a petition seeking to block the LRT-MRT fare hike in the Supreme Court.He said the high court was likely to reject the petition for lack of jurisdiction, lack of due process and the argument that the fare hike was long overdue.“It’s hard to get a TRO when the government is the one involved, most especially when income from the increase in fares will result in an increase in revenue,” he said.Bias vs bus, jeepney ridersBarzaga said removing the P2 billion in subsidies to LRT and MRT commuters would reduce the government’s bias against commuters riding the jeepneys and buses on which fares are not subsidized.“I think it is really unfair, my constituents in Cavite who travel to Makati receive no subsidies of up to 60 percent of the fare for LRT and up to 75 percent for MRT,” he said.Beginning Sunday, LRT and MRT fares increased by 50 to 87 percent. The new base fare is P11, plus P1 for every kilometer. End-to-end fare on MRT 3 increased from P15 to P28.The fares on LRT 1 moved up from P20 to P30 for single-journey tickets and to P29 for stored-value cards. The fare at LRT 2 increased to P24 on stored-value cards and P25 for single-journey tickets, against the previous P15.–",1
"He donned a red Santa Claus stocking cap adorned with blinking lights and was greeted with cheers, but the Christmas message that Philippine National Police Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, gave families of those arrested or killed in the crackdown on illegal drugs did not exactly repeat the season’s “sounding joy.”It’s time to move on and begin the healing process, Dela Rosa told at least 625 children from the villages of Payatas, Old Balara, Batasan Hills, Commonwealth and Holy Spirit in Quezon City, many of whom were orphaned by the government’s bloody war on drugs.‘No forever’“Many of you are hurting because your fathers were killed or arrested, but the police are hurting, too,” Dela Rosa said. “We don’t want anyone wounded or killed. What we are doing is also for your future.”There is no forever, he added during the Quezon City Police District’s gift-giving program on Saturday when some 800 residents of the city’s poor communities were handed candies, toys and grocery items.But while some families echoed Dela Rosa’s message, others found it difficult to simply move forward without getting justice.For many families, the pain and fear from their harrowing experiences still linger, said Avelino Buizon, a coordinator for the Diocese of Novaliches who was among those in charge of gathering families of victims for the event.Lessen the pain“Some parents whom we invited did not want to go and see the police, but sent their children anyway,” Buizon said in an interview. “The parents [remain] fearful, but the children … only know joy.”Added Buizon: “At least for Christmas, this program and the gifts the children received can somehow lessen the pain in their hearts.”Others have learned to live with the death of their family member. Among them was Kathrina Polo, one of the coordinators of the program, whose husband, Cherwen, was shot dead by police officers from Station 6.Some officers from Station 6 had been tagged the “Davao Boys” in a recent Reuters report because the policemen allegedly involved in the summary execution of drug suspects came from President Duterte’s hometown of Davao City.‘We should move on’Polo, who was seated with police and city officials onstage, refused to talk about her husband’s killing in what officers claimed was a drug raid.“We should move on because the fault of one policeman is not the fault of all of them,” she told the Inquirer.Polo said she had filed a case in the PNP Internal Affairs Service and the Office of the Ombudsman against the Station 6 officers involved in her husband’s killing.It was difficult to work with the police at first, Polo said, but she realized that she had to move forward for the sake of her three young children.",1
"The Recto and Manzano families are coming together for 2016 elections, with TV host and actor Luis Manzano supporting his father and stepfather who are both running for senator in the same slate.Luis came to Club Filipino yesterday for the unveiling of the senatorial lineup of Grace Poe and Francis Escudero, which includes actor Edu Manzano and Sen. Ralph Recto.Edu Manzano is Luis’ father, while Recto is his stepfather. Recto, though, was a no-show in the event and sent his son Ryan Christian as his representative.“Today I have work, but I said I have to be here for my dad, for my stepdad… Family is family, you’ll find a way,” Luis told reporters.He also said he would try to campaign for his dad and for Recto, as well as for his mother, actress and Batangas Gov. Vilma Santos-Recto, who is running as a district representative.“I’ll try my best because I have to separate his campaign, my mom’s campaign, my Tito Ralph’s campaign,” he said.Recto is a reelectionist senator and is also part of the lineup of the administration party.Edu Manzano, while a successful show biz personality, is no stranger to politics. He used to be Makati vice mayor and ran for Vice President in 2010.Luis said his father’s decision to run for the Senate came as a surprise because the family thought he would be seeking another position.",1
"SEN. Paolo Benigno “Bam” Aquino has filed a measure that seeks to simplify annulment procedures by recognizing an annulment of marriage by any church or religious sect upon order of a competent court.Senate Bill 1815 aims to recognize the annulment of marriage by a religious sect by amending Article 36 of Executive Order 209 or the Family Code of the Philippines. Aquino’s bill is similar to the measure filed by Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri in March that proposes to recognize church annulments to have “the same effect as an annulment declared by a competent court.”On the other hand, Sen. Loren Legarda filed SB 410 in July 2016, prescribing an additional ground for annulment by amending the Family Code of the Philippines.Under Legarda’s measure, a marriage may also be annulled if the parties have “been separated for at least five years.” Her proposed amendment will “cater to those who cannot afford legal services by making litigation as simple and expedient as possible.”“Every Filipino must have equal access to annulment procedures, regardless of financial capacity,” Aquino said.“With the process of annulment being both tedious and expensive, it has become a privilege for the rich rather than the right of every Filipino citizen,” he said.He noted that a lawyer’s acceptance fee alone can cost at least P80,000 while pleading fees, appearance fees and psychological fees can be “even more expensive.”“Apart from the financial burden, seeking annulment is also a tiring, cumbersome and time-consuming process,” Aquino said.“Although not known to many, the Catholic Church introduced reforms in 2015 to streamline and hasten their annulment procedures. Pope Francis also stated that the annulment procedures “should be free,” he said.“Taking a cue from the Catholic Church and the Pope himself, the Philippines must take steps to improve its laws on annulment, beginning with the recognition of religious annulments,” the senator added.Zubiri said that although divorce remains a contentious issue in the Catholic Church, annulment of marriage is allowed. “However, the process is both inefficient and arduous depending on the nature of the case and the available evidence.”“As a result, the annulment process can take years to conclude. On September 8, 2015, Pope Francis released two motu propio documents that were meant to make the annulment process more efficient. The date of effectivity for the documents was December 8, 2015,” Zubiri said.He added, “Given the strides taken by the Church to improve the efficiency of the annulment process and the State’s principle of equality before the law, this bill proposes to recognize church annulments to have the same effect as an annulment declared by a competent court.”Legarda noted that in 2012, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) received 10,528 annulment cases.",1
"Two days before the 32nd anniversary of the People Power Revolution that ousted the dictator President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, thousands of students nationwide poured into the streets in a massive walkout to protest what they described as President Duterte’s “increasingly tyrannical rule.”Clad in black, students from the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) and Manila, Polytechnic University of the Philippines, De La Salle University, University of Santo Tomas, Philippine Normal University and other state universities and colleges marched from their schools to Mendiola on Friday to call for unity against “threats to democracy.”#WalkoutPHThe #WalkoutPH protest is part of a series of nationwide mobilization in response, among others, to the push for Charter change (Cha-cha) to enable a shift to a federalist form of government that would further cement Mr. Duterte’s “one-man rule,” said Kabataan Rep. Sarah Elago.At the People Power Monument on Edsa, Quezon City, Catholic priests, farmers, fisherfolk and members of the urban poor have gathered since Feb. 17 for a nine-day period of prayer and fasting meant “to uphold democracy.”RejectionLed by Pambansang Kilusan ng mga Samahang Magsasaka, Urban Poor Alliance Action Committee and Gomburza, the groups expressed their rejection of the possible change in the 1987 Constitution that they described as one of the “most precious legacies” of the People Power Revolution three decades ago.“The current administration seeks to cast aside this legacy, proposing to replace it with a federalist project short on social justice principles and long on authoritarian possibilities lurking beneath its extravagant promises,” said Gomburza leader Fr. Robert Reyes, also known as the “running priest.”Prayers, fastingThe participants of the “Dasal-Ayuno” began their fast on Feb. 17 and will end it on Feb. 25 in time for the 32nd anniversary of the People Power Revolution.Sister Teresita Alo of the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Mother of God said that prayer could win back democracy, a defiant stance similar to that of the Church during the Marcos martial law era.“We are here in a movement to reclaim our democracy. We won Edsa through prayer and sacrifice,” Alo said.The student protesters also demanded the full implementation of the free tuition policy and the junking of “Oplan Tanggal Bulok, Tanggal Usok” program that cracked down on worn-out smoke-belching public utility vehicles.They also condemned the continuing extension of martial law in Mindanao, the recently passed tax reform bill and the threat to press freedom following Malacañang’s ban on a reporter from Rappler.“There is a chilling effect when Duterte publicly belittles or threatens to silence media that report on the atrocities committed by his government,” said Mikko Ringia, chair of the UP College of Mass Communication student council.The UPD campus was symbolically placed on “shutdown” on Friday, with the gates of historic Palma Hall kept closed. It was on the steps of this building that students gathered in the 1970s to resist the Marcos regime.‘Walk for Life’The UPD administration meanwhile threw its support behind the activities that would be held in celebration of the Edsa revolt, “as part of their education,” UPD chancellor Michael Tan said in a memorandum on Thursday.In Los Baños, Laguna province, over a hundred students and teachers participated in the youth-led protest, with UP Los Baños (UPLB) teachers allowing their classes to join the protest that started early on Friday.In a statement, the youth political group Samahan ng Kabataan Para sa Bayan-UPLB said that they got together “to condemn these violations of our basic democratic rights to life, quality education and due process. We stand firm against these threats to our liberties and to democracy.”Jeepney drivers and workers protesting against the government’s public utility vehicle modernization program also joined the protest, which coincided with mass actions held simultaneously in Baguio City, Angeles City, Mabalacat City, Malolos City, Metro Manila, Calamba City, Miagao, Iloilo City, Tacloban City, Cebu City, Marawi City and Davao City.Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, meanwhile, called on members of the clergy as well as religious and lay organizations in his archdiocese to join today’s “Walk for Life” prayer rally at Quirino Grandstand in Manila.“Walking is a symbol of life. Let us walk for our brothers and sisters whose lives are beset with problems and threats,” Tagle said in a video message.Throwback to Marcos eraThe “Walk for Life” prayer rally will be held on Saturday from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m., with simultaneous activities in other parts of the country, including Fuente Osmeña Circle and Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral in Cebu City; Gaston Park in Cagayan de Oro City; Tarlac City Plazuela in Tarlac City; and San Pablo City Cathedral and Dagatan Boulevard, Sampaloc Lake, at San Pablo City in Laguna.Much like Mr. Duterte’s policies evoke a throwback to the Marcos era, Elago said, the students now have their own throwback to the youth who joined the First Quarter Storm series of protests against Marcos.“In this critical period, we choose not to be silent on the various ways this government is killing us. It’s high time for the youth to show our power … and express our resolute commitment to the causes of our people,” Elago said.“This protest is our response to President Duterte’s threat to kick out students who join rallies,” said Raoul Manuel, deputy secretary general of National Union of Students of the Philippines and former student regent of UP.",1
"Nearly half, or 48 percent, of Filipinos disapprove of the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), according to the results of a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey.The nationwide survey, conducted from March 20 to 23, also found that most Filipinos were not hopeful that the proposed Bangsamoro government would bring peace in its core territories or that the government would benefit from the peace talks with the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).However, an earlier SWS survey conducted from Feb. 22 to March 1 in the core territory of the proposed Bangsamoro entity found the respondents to be more hopeful that a Bangsamoro government would bring peace and development after May 2016, and that the Filipino people would benefit from the peace talks with the MILF.Included in the survey were Sulu, Basilan, Isabela City, Tawi-Tawi, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Cotabato City, and the areas near the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in Lanao del Norte and Cotabato.The February special survey in the core territory also found that most people in the area were hopeful that Congress could still pass the BBL despite the negative fallout from the killing of 44 troopers from the elite Special Action Force in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, in January, in the hands of MILF and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) rebels.“Attitudes toward the proposed Basic Law were positive throughout the core territory,” SWS said in a statement released on Friday.Opinion on BBLNationwide, 48 percent of the respondents said they disapproved of the proposed BBL, while 23 percent approved and 28 percent expressed indecision, resulting in a record-low net score (approval minus disapproval) of -24. The latest figure was 41 points lower than the net +16 (44 percent approve, 27 percent disapprove, correctly rounded) posted in June 2014.But net approval of the proposed BBL in the core areas ranged from +91 in Cotabato near ARMM (93 percent approve, 2 percent disapprove) to +18 in Sulu (31 percent approve, 14 percent disapprove) and Isabela City (38 percent approve, 20 percent disapprove).“Not hopeful” was the sentiment of 62 percent of respondents nationwide when asked in the nationwide March survey about whether the proposed Bangsamoro government would bring peace and development in its core territories, while 37 percent said they were hopeful.Among those surveyed in the core territories, the proportion of those who said they were “very hopeful/somewhat hopeful” that the new Bangsamoro government would bring peace and development after May 2016 ranged from 49 percent in Sulu to 96 percent in Cotabato near ARMM.The proportion of those who were “somewhat not hopeful/not hopeful at all” ranged from 4 percent in Cotabato near ARMM to 52 percent in Sulu.Benefit of peace talksAccording to the nationwide survey, 56 percent of the respondents said the peace talks with the MILF would yield “a little benefit/no benefit at all” to Filipinos, while 42 percent said otherwise.On the other hand, the February survey in the core territories showed the majorities saying they saw “much benefit/moderate benefit” in the ongoing peace talks with the MILF, ranging from 59 percent in Sulu to 97 percent in Cotabato near ARMM and Maguindanao.Hope majority sentimentHope was the majority sentiment in the core territories, except in Sulu, where 56 percent were “somewhat not hopeful/not hopeful at all” that Congress could still pass the BBL despite the Mamasapano incident. Forty-four percent in Sulu were “very hopeful/somewhat hopeful” that Congress can still pass the BBL.The proportion of those who were “very hopeful/somewhat hopeful” that Congress can still pass the BBL despite the Mamasapano incident ranged from 54 percent in Isabela City to 94 percent in Cotabato near ARMM.Little knowledge of BBLNationwide, knowledge about the BBL was insufficient as 83 percent said they had “little or no knowledge” while 17 percent said they had “extensive or partially sufficient knowledge” about it.In the core areas surveyed, the proportion of those who had “extensive/partial but sufficient” knowledge about the BBL ranged from 26 percent in Sulu to 54 percent in Cotabato near ARMM. Those who said their knowledge was “only a little/almost none” ranged from 48 percent in Lanao del Sur to 71 percent in Maguindanao.The national survey, conducted from March 20 to 23, used face-to-face interviews with 1,200 respondents. It had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3 percentage points.The special survey in the core territory of the proposed Bangsamoro, conducted from Feb. 22 to March 1, used face-to-face interviews with 1,500 respondents. It had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 2.5 percentage points. Of the 1,500 respondents from Bangsamoro territories, 800 were from the Sulu archipelago, while 700 were from Central Mindanao.

" Malacañang on Wednesday blasted the person behind a video posted on social media allegedly showing how a Philippine National Police-Special Action Force (PNP-SAF) trooper was killed during the clash in Mamasapano town, Maguindanao last month.“Whoever uploaded the video is a heartless fellow. If you still have some humanity left in your soul, and we ask you to take it down,” Presidential Spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said in a Palace briefing.The six-minute video shows a PNP-SAF member being shot at close range. The rest of the footage shows armed men taking the weapons and equipment of the slain troopers.Lacierda said the public had the “right to be angry.” He said he was also able to watch the video on Tuesday evening, when it first went viral on Facebook. One copy of the video has been viewed 1.48 million times as of 5:30 p.m. Wednesday.“You have a right to be outraged by such brutal display of violence. But at the end of the day you need to seek the truth. You need to find justice for all of those who died, including the SAF hero who was in that video,” he explained.The Secretary said they do not know who released the video and what his motive was.“It came as a surprise as well,” he said.RELATED STORIESPNP hurting as alleged video of SAF shooting spreads onlineGov’t exec confirms viral shooting video taken during Mamasapano clash",1

"Forty-seven states, DC and the Virgin Islands have laws that specifically allow moms to breastfeed in any public or private location. Two of the remaining states — South Dakota and Virginia — exempt breastfeeding moms from public indecency or nudity laws, and Idaho is the only state that has yet to pass any similar laws.Despite these laws, we often hear about stories of moms who are given a hard time for breastfeeding in public, often asked to cover up or leave restaurants, malls, even churches because they’re nursing.In support of moms breastfeeding in public, the American restaurant chain Hooters has announced that it will go ‘topless.’Hooters, Inc. is the trade name of two privately held American restaurant chains: Hooters of America, Incorporated, based in Atlanta, Georgia, and Hooters, Incorporated, based in Clearwater, Florida. The Hooters name is a double entendre referring to both its owl logo, a bird known for its “hooting” calls, and an American slang term for human breasts popularized by comedian Steve Martin on the hit comedy series Saturday Night Live.Hooters is a restaurant whose wait staff are primarily attractive young women, usually referred to simply as “Hooter Girls”, whose revealing outfits and sex appeal are played up and are a primary component of the company’s image.Beginning August 1, which happens to be the start of breastfeeding awareness month in the U.S., Hooters’ wait staff will go completely topless. Consequently, all 460 plus Hooters locations and franchises will be off limits to customers who are under 21 years old.“Breastfeeding is not only a healthy practice with tremendous nutritional benefits to babies; it’s also nothing to be ashamed about or ridiculed in private or in public,” a statement from the Hooters Atlanta headquarters said.Moms interviewed by The Adobo Chronicles expressed overwhelming approval for the Hooters move.As for the dads?

"Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya today announced that the Philippine government will soon import a fleet of quadruple-decker buses from Japan as a way to ease Metro Manila’s worsening traffic and mass transportation nightmares.Abaya, who is facing calls for his resignation because of his failure to address unsurmountable issues with MRT, Manila’s light railway system, as well as daily traffic gridlock in the metropolis, said his boss, President NoyNoy Aquino, has given the go-signal for the importation. The money needed to purchase the buses will come from DAP, the president’s taxpayer-funded Disbursement Acceleration Program.The announcement comes just days after the Aquino government said it will phase out some 600,000 public utility jeepneys (PUJ) that are at least 15 years old.In preparation for the arrival of the quaduple-deckers, the Department of Highways will begin dismantling overpasses along EDSA and other major thoroughfares in order to accommodate the height of the buses.“We will finally see the end of long lines at the MRT stations as well as congested streets,” Abaya said.",0
"Facing a deluge of criticisms, the House of Representatives on Wednesday backpedaled on its proposal removing Vice President Leni Robredo as President Rodrigo Duterte’s constitutional successor during the transition to the proposed federal form of government.Cebu Rep. Raul del Mar, Robredo’s party mate in the Liberal Party, moved to “recommit” the Resolution of Both Houses No. 15 to the House committee on constitutional amendments.He said there was a need to “introduce perfecting amendments to the failure to include the Vice President in the first line of succession which led to some misunderstanding.”Majority Leader Rolando Andaya Jr. did not oppose Del Mar’s move, saying the administration lawmakers would also present its own revisions to the proposal to amend the 1987 Constitution.“On the part of the majority, at the proper time, we will submit an amendment to the committee as requested by … Del Mar,” Andaya said.‘Uncertainty’The proponent, Leyte Rep. Vicente Veloso, had argued that the transitory provision was meant to address the “uncertainty” about the vice presidency created by the electoral protest of former Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against Robredo’s victory.In Bacolod City, Robredo described the House proposal as desperate.“They did not succeed in the elections, so they are trying to do it through other means. We know that the Filipino people will not allow this,” Robredo said at the 5th Negros Occidental Small Fishers Alliance Congress.Amusing argumentRobredo said she found the argument of Veloso, chair of the House committee on constitutional amendments, amusing.She reminded Veloso that she won over Marcos by more than 200,000 votes, and that his electoral protest against her “won’t prosper.”The Vice President also pointed out that Veloso, who won by less than a 100 votes over his opponent, was also facing an election protest.“Does this mean he should not sit as congressman and carry out his mandate because there is a protest?” she said.Robredo said she was happy that senators, including Senate President Vicente Sotto III, and congressmen had spoken out against the proposal.Ako Bicol Rep. Rodel Batocabe said taking out the Vice President as President Duterte’s successor during the transition period to a federal form of government further politicized the proposed new charter.Batocabe said it was just logical for a sitting Vice President to replace a President as spelled out in the 1987 Constitution and the previous Charters.“If we are going to amend the Constitution, it should not be tainted with politics because the Constitution should stand the test of time regardless of political affiliation, partisanship and ideologies,” Batocabe told the Inquirer.",1

"The World Bank in its World Development Report 2008 pointed out: “In the 21st century, agriculture continues to be a fundamental instrument for sustainable development and poverty reduction. Three of every four people in developing countries live in rural areas—2.1 billion living on less than $2 a day and 880 million on less than $1 a day—and most depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.”Incoming Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Nestor Espenilla cited financial inclusion as his primary goal. Such goal is crucial, as the Philippines remains largely unbanked, with nearly 7 out of 10 Filipinos keeping their savings hidden away at home, unsecured and unproductive.Even more noteworthy, Governor Espenilla urged banks and financial institutions to open and ease credit access to agriculture, citing lack of financing the major reason why agriculture remains behind industry and services in terms of productivity. Where industry and services accounted for 33.4 percent and 57.1 percent respectively of the country’s 2015 GDP, agriculture contributed only 9.5 percent.This is terribly troubling. See the tragic statistics: 10.033 million Filipinos—or over 1 out of 5 working Filipinos as of the January 2017 Labor Force Survey—worked in agriculture. In fact, the Philippines remains a largely agrarian country. According to 2015 World Bank data, up to 56 million Filipinos—roughly 55.6 percent of our 100.7-million 2015 population—lived in rural areas. As of 2015, roughly 32 percent of the country’s land area—or 9.671 million hectares out of a total 30,000,000 hectares—were considered agricultural land.Starving farmers and fisherfolks of credit and other support had rendered Philippine agriculture unproductive and unprofitable—and has effectively impoverished farming and fishing communities throughout the archipelago. On top of the resulting widening wealth and income gap, the food security of the entire country was placed in serious peril.This is the financial equivalent of apartheid.On paper, this shouldn’t be the case. The Agri-Agra Law of 2009 (RA 10000) mandates all banking institutions, whether government or private, to set aside at least 25 percent of their total loanable funds for agriculture and fisheries (15 percent for agricultural lending and 10 percent for agrarian reform beneficiaries). The Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 (RA 8435) clearly outlined the various modes of bringing food and agriculture to modern standards.Performance however has been perfunctory at best and totally evasive at worst. As of June 2016, the local banking industry fell short of the 15-percent quota for agricultural lending, devoting only P374.5 billion to agriculture and fisheries or only 13.18 percent of its total loan portfolio. It was far worse for the 10-percent quota for agrarian-reform beneficiaries, as local banking institutions allotted only P29.12 billion, or only 0.97 percent of their total portfolios for this requirement.In fact, compliance differs widely across subsectors of the banking industry. Where universal and commercial banks and thrift banks respectively allotted 13.09 percent and 9.92 percent of their loan portfolios to agricultural lending, rural and cooperative banks loaned up to 30.79 percent to farmers and fisherfolk.The pattern is similar when it comes to agrarian-reform credit. Universal and commercial banks and thrift banks respectively devoted only 0.67 percent and 1.45 percent for agrarian reform beneficiaries, while rural and cooperative banks set aside up to 16.73 percent of their loan portfolios.This suggests that the current “one-size-fits-all” approach to agricultural financing needs to be revisited and revamped. The Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC) recently estimated that the unmet credit demand for priority agricultural commodities amounted to P364 billion in 2014. It can only be worse circa 2017.To be sure, even BSP officials have called for a review of the Agri-Agra Law, as banks and other financial institutions are extremely risk-averse and generally consider loans to farmers and fisherfolk to be too risky. There is even anecdotal evidence of financial institutions choosing to pay the penalties for non-compliance, instead of actively seeking and assisting agricultural enterprises.The recent launch of the Credit Information System offers an opportunity for positive change. New financing approaches are definitely needed. Initiating and implementing innovative solutions require both political will and BSP technical leadership. The private sector can and will respond. But government must incentivize the private banks for the higher risk they bear in agricultural lending.For far too long, Philippine agriculture has been treated by Philippine policymakers as a poor stepchild of development. And yet, as the World Bank pointed out early on: “…[A]griculture and its associated industries are essential to growth and to reducing mass poverty and food insecurity.”Email: angara.ed@gmail.com| Facebook & Twitter: @edangara",1

"The House Committee on Ways and Means removed P90 billion worth of Value Added Tax (VAT) exemptions under 79 special laws and gave up P6 billion of potential government revenues from taxes on luxury cars in approving the Duterte administration’s tax reform bill dubbed as Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (Train).Party-list lawmakers Antonio Tinio of Alliance of Concerned Teachers and Ariel Casilao of Anakpawis made the disclosure a day after the House panel approved the Train bill, which also lowers personal income taxes from 32 percent to 25 percent.Tinio, who voted no on the measure, said the Finance department is expected to raise P90 billion from the removal of VAT exemptions provided by the 79 special laws covering civic institutions, state universities and colleges and cooperatives, among other sectors.The bill imposes additional excise taxes on petroleum products, including a P6 per liter excise tax on diesel fuel spread over three years.“The Finance department’s target revenue from new fuel taxes is P120 billion, and their second largest target revenue will come from the removal of tax exemptions provided by 79 laws which is valued at P90 billion. In fact, there was even a discussion on whether we should be explicit [in the bill] on the repeal of these [79] laws.Eventually, the wordings [of the bill] were made in general because they don’t want to the public to see the sectors which will be affected,” Tinio told reporters.“It’s clear that they are hiding something. By lifting the VAT exemptions provided by these 79 laws, this will create a domino effect on all sectors. By not being specific about it, they are avoiding possible backlash,” Casilao said.Tinio said the Duterte administration’s tax reform proposal is not out to plug the government revenue loss as a result of lowered income taxes but to profit from taxpayers’ money.While the Finance department estimates that the government will lose P140 billion in revenues from the reduced taxes, he pointed out, it is targeting P250 billion in revenues from the new taxes that are also incorporated in the tax reform bill.“This [bill] is clearly anti-poor because new taxes will only burden the poor. Fixed income earners will benefit from lowered income taxes, but how about the poor [who don’t enjoy fixed income]?” Tinio said.He said the Finance department yielded to wishes of car manufacturers in decreasing the initially proposed 200 percent increase in excise taxes for luxury vehicles.As a result, the department’s expected revenues from additional automobile taxes have gone down to P24 billion from P30 billion.“We can’t understand why the Finance department would hear the side of the importers and distributors of the luxury vehicles and let go of P6 billion of potential revenues and, yet, they want to remove VAT exemptions on cooperatives which is just P3 billion,” Tinio said.",1
"Vice President Leni Robredo on Friday called on Filipinos to remain vigilant as the country was “plunged into the depths of uncertainty” with the ouster of Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno.In a statement, Robredo assailed the Supreme Court vote to remove Sereno by way of a quo warranto petition as “a blatant betrayal of the sacredness of the Constitution.”She added: “True power will always be with the people. I ask the Filipino people to join me in utmost vigilance as the rest of these developments unfold, and to add their voice as we defend our judicial system, our Constitution and ultimately, our democracy.”Former President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III also slammed the Supreme Court ruling and said the decision was apparently tailor-fit to push the single objective of taking Sereno out of office.Fruit metaphorIn a statement written in Filipino, the former President used the metaphor of a fruit harvested before its time to describe the sour taste that was left by the high court ruling.He assailed the justices for choosing to misinterpret the law which, Mr. Aquino maintained, has been very clear in stating that impeachable officials may be removed from office only through the impeachment process.“Just how sour is this decision that they’re forcing us to swallow?” Mr. Aquino said.Aquino appointed Sereno Chief Justice in 2012, saying that he believed her legal skills and what would have been her long service in the high court—20 years—would pave the way for lasting judicial reform.Dangerous precedentRobredo described the ruling as setting “a very dangerous precedent that may seriously undermine the independence of the judiciary,” and urged people to “raise their voice” against it “to right the wrong” that removed Sereno as Chief Justice, “particularly given how close the vote was for a decision of such magnitude.”The Supreme Court justices on Friday voted 8-6 favoring the quo warranto petition that removed Sereno from her post.‘Fight not yet over’“As the second highest official in the land, let me assure you: The fight is not yet over,” Robredo said.“At this point, we should not lose hope as there are still legal remedies available. We are disappointed, but we will not stop,” the Vice President said, adding she was also concerned over the coming Supreme Court ruling on her electoral protest against losing vice presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos.",1

"THE HOUSE of Representatives leadership is urging President Duterte to form a 20-member group of elders who could serve as a guide to senators and representatives in the proposed constituent assembly (Con-ass) that would amend the Constitution.Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said he would propose the creation of a constitutional commission (Con-com) through an executive order to address concerns of those who want Charter change (Cha-cha) through a constitutional convention (Con-con).Alvarez has shot down the proposal for a Con-con because of the massive cost of electing the delegates and paying their staff and overhead expenses.He said part of the Con-com’s goal was to sway adverse public opinion in favor of amending the Constitution.Alvarez was not surprised about the public’s resistance to Cha-cha considering that previous attempts were seen primarily as a means to extend the term of the President and other elected officials.“It’s sad that the public is wary of Cha-cha but I can’t blame them because of their bad experience. But it is the President himself who stressed that lawmakers are Filipinos themselves and as Filipinos they should do something for the country,” he said.Among the elders Alvarez wanted the President to appoint to the Con-com were former Chief Justice Reynato Puno, former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr., lawyer Reuben Canoy (founder of Radio Mindanao Network) and the San Beda Law School dean, Fr. Ranhilio Aquino.Alvarez said the other Con-com members may come from nongovernment organizations and the academe.“They will be tasked with studying and reviewing the present Constitution and then drafting a new Charter, which will be submitted to the constituent assembly where it will be discussed thoroughly,” he said.He said the creation of the Con-com would not violate the Constitution because it would still be Congress, acting as one that would approve the changes, that would include a shift to federal form of government and relaxing foreign equity limits.The proposed amendments would then be submitted to the public for approval in a referendum in 2019.",1
"After seven years in and out of the Bataan District Jail (BDJ), Bernadeth Gabor could feel confident to disprove President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent assertion that those who had spent time behind bars are hopeless and could no longer be rehabilitated to become productive members of society.Make no mistake, Gabor is no troublemaker. She is the dean of the College of Technology of the Bataan Peninsula State University (BPSU) who initiated the Hope Behind Bars program to help hundreds of BDJ “residents” get a second shot at life after prison.The in-prison skills development program offers various technical-vocational courses to inmates.Mr. Duterte and others who see no hope for former prisoners might learn that some of Gabor’s students who are now free had landed decent jobs here and abroad while others were helping her maintain and expand the program.Gabor, 41, started Hope Behind Bars in 2010 after a friend working at the BDJ asked for her help to teach some skills to the inmates.She was hesitant at first to jump at the idea because she feared for her life due to the bad image of prisoners she then had.Nonetheless, with the civic-mindedness that had been instilled in her since childhood, she accepted the challenge, she told the Inquirer.Despite lacking resources in the first two years of the program, she soldiered on, inspired by the BDJ residents’ “eagerness to learn.”“They see you as their chance to become better individuals. They are very happy because they learn a lot. I’ve grown fond of them because I saw hope in their eyes,” Gabor said.It was difficult for her to recruit other teachers as they, too, were afraid of the inmates as she was. But after some prodding and experiencing how it felt to teach inside a jail, volunteers started signing up.What was initially a one-woman show became a full-fledged program backed by no less than 50 teachers and BPSU staff.The university later provided financial support. This enabled Gabor, who first taught how to bake bread like the popular pan de sal, to offer other courses such as welding, automotive repair, housekeeping and even dressmaking.Most of her students have been certified as professionals by the Technical Education Skills and Development Authority (Tesda).BDJ residents who took part in the program were mostly those who were about to be released and who saw their new skills as a boost to their social reintegration.Gabor said a study showed that those who took part earned enough to send money to their families to buy appliances and fix their homes. Some have been employed in cruise ships and even as security officers in provincial malls, she said.Good feeling“It gives you a good feeling that somehow you are able to restore their self-confidence, that you are able to impart to them new skills, knowledge and information,” she said.Gabor’s work has been recognized by the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, which has tapped her to replicate Hope Behind Bars in Olongapo City in Zambales province.Bato Balani Foundation Inc. and Diwa Learning Systems Inc. have also honored her with “The Many Faces of the Teacher” award.Now on its 14th year, the award aims to inspire and encourage teachers around the country to do more, especially outside their classrooms where they can make a make “a bigger difference.”The achievements of Gabor’s students dispute Mr. Duterte’s recent statement that prisoners “do not want [to go] out of prison because they have lost the existence, the essence or existence of a productive person.”“If they get used to six, seven, 10 years, 15, 20 years they are in prison, no matter what form of livelihood you teach them in Tesda, once they are out, they will look for some trouble. And then they will return to Muntinlupa and they will be happy,” Mr. Duterte said in a Tesda anniversary speech.‘There is always hope’Gabor, however, believes “there is always hope” for those who may have lost their way.“Once they are out, there are jobs and they have families waiting for them. The people must learn to accept them. That’s why I strive to open the minds of others that they (prisoners) can change,” she said.According to Gabor, one of the main reasons some released prisoners go back to jail is people look down on them and are afraid of them.“This should not be the case. We should support them in their path to changing their lives,” she said.Gabor said her passion to teach at the BDJ was further strengthened when two years into the program, her younger brother was locked up at the facility on “false charges” of selling and possessing illegal drugs.After spending at least two years in jail, her brother was acquitted. Now he is a contractor abroad.Gabor said what happened to her brother made her better understand the plight of the BDJ inmates and realize that people in prison need help and should be given an opportunity to turn a new leaf.",1

"THE Senate on Monday approved the landmark measure creating the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) to consolidate all housing agencies under one body.The senators passed on third and final reading Senate Bill 1578 to streamline bureaucracy and compel shelter agencies to “work together more harmoniously and connect their plans and programs.”Sen. Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito, chairman of the Senate Committee on Urban Planning, Housing and Resettlement and sponsor of the bill said that for the last 30 years, the country has “been deprived of a rational and systematic way of addressing the nation’s housing needs.”The senator said the country is facing more than two million housing needs this year. The figure is projected to balloon to 6,571,387 by the end of 2022.“We continue to be challenged with problems of overcrowding, restrictions in unlocking land for human settlements, increasing number of homeless people and multiplying families living in slums, riverbanks and danger zones,” Ejercito said.“What we need is one housing department with one board working towards one direction…creating the roadmap for housing and urban development, leading its implementation, setting the general direction for everyone and able to follow through each and every project with clear functions, policies, budget and financing,” he said.He said the creation of the DHSUD would combine the administrative functions of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council and the planning and regulatory functions of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board.The proposed housing department would be responsible for all housing and urban concerns, including planning, policy making, regulations, program coordination and performance monitoring.Under the bill, the department would be composed of the Office of the Secretary, the Bureaus of Policy Development, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation, Environmental, Land Use, and Urban Planning and Development, Housing and Real Estate Development Regulation and the Homeowners Association and Community Development.It also proposes the creation of a National Shelter Board to address housing policies and plans as well as to reduce bureaucracy. The board will be composed of the secretary of the DHSUD, the director-general of the National Economic and Development Authority, the secretaries of the Departments of Finance, Budget and Management, Public Works and Highways, Department of the Interior and Local Government, the heads of the key shelter agencies, specifically the National Housing Authority, Home Guaranty Cooperation, National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation, Home Development Mutual Fund and the Social Housing Finance Corporation.“Currently, the governing boards of the key shelter agencies are operating and meeting separately. The proposed National Shelter Board will rationalize and streamline the governing Boards of the different shelter agencies to come up with a moare holistic and coherent plan for the housing and urban development sector,” Ejercito said.",1

"The call for a revolutionary government, or “RevGov,” “is the personal opinion of [Interior Undersecretary] Epimaco Densing III and not of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG),” acting Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said in a statement on Saturday.Densing, who was the main guest of a citizens’ group calling itself Mula sa Masa Duterte Movement (MMDM) on Friday called on President Duterte to declare a revolutionary government as a way to hasten the country’s transition to a federal government.“He was speaking as honorary chairman of the MMDM, and not for the DILG,” Año said of Densing.In an interview with the Inquirer during the MMDM activity in Butuan City, Densing said: “People are allowed in the Constitution to push for a revolutionary government if they think that the existing government no longer serves their interest.”He added: “In the proposed RevGov, we want to suspend the 1987 Constitution.”Official positionBut Año clarified that the official position of the department on federalism follows the federal Constitution drafted by the Consultative Committee appointed by the President.“We are advocating for federalism through constitutional means. The 1987 Constitution has clear provisions on how a change in the system of government can be effected. We abide by these provisions and will see to it that any change in the system of government goes through constitutional processes,” Año said.He explained that the DILG’s “Federalism Roadshow” held in Caraga, Dumaguete, Baguio, Cebu, Legazpi, Davao and Tacloban seeks to inform the public about the merits of the federal system of government, not a revolutionary government.He also clarified that only duly accredited civil society organizations under the DILG’s Center for Federalism and Constitutional Reform may use the DILG’s name in its federalism advocacy activities.Año said public comments on the draft Federal Charter can be forwarded to the DILG’s Center for Federalism and Constitutional Reform at info@pederalismo.org.ph or the Pederalismo Facebook page @bayanihanfederalism.Plan for Duterte“People will push for a people’s government, they will push President Duterte to do People Power so that he would serve as President during the revolutionary period,” Densing said during the MMDM gathering attended by some 300 people wearing red shirts with the words, “Federalism Now! thru RevGov in a democratic way!”“Once he is there, he will accept the revolutionary power and the first thing he should do is sign a provisional Constitution with the Bill of Rights, then issue an executive order to organize a constitutional commission to set up the federal Constitution of the Philippines,” the interior undersecretary said.",1

"Lanao del Norte provincial authorities on Friday formed a task force and offered a reward to find the killer of Sapad municipal health officer Dr. Dreyfuss Perlas.“We had already conducted a conference and discussed the possible clues that will lead to the solution of the murder of Perlas,” said provincial police chief Senior Supt. Faro Antonio Olaguera.Perlas, 31, was gunned down while driving home on his motorcycle on Wednesday night in Kapatagan town.He was shot once, the bullet piercing his heart after hitting him in the back as he drove through Barangay Maranding Annex on his way home in nearby Lala town.Olaguera said the police Anticybercrime Group would examine Perlas’ password-protected cell phone to collect possible leads to his killing.He said the investigation would focus on reports that Perlas, a native of Batan, Aklan, had received threats.He also said Perlas recently had a heated argument with a patient or relative of a patient at Bontilao Country Hospital in Lala where the doctor had also served.“I have approved the reward to those who could pinpoint the suspected assailant of Dr. Perlas and directed the PNP (Philippine National Police) to mobilize the TF Perlas so we could give justice to Dr. Perlas,” Gov. Imelda Quibranza-Dimaporo said.A C-130 military plane flew Perlas’ body from Pagadian City to Kalibo, Aklan, where it was met by his mother, Leovigilda Bolivar-Perlas, and sympathizers, including Batan Mayor Rodel Ramos.“We are thankful for the assistance provided to us by Lanao del Norte officials and we also have high expectation that the killing of my son would be solved very soon,” the doctor’s father, Dennis Perlas, said.A scholar of the Department of Health (DOH) and a volunteer of its Doctor to the Barrios program, the popular and well-loved doctor has been praised by colleagues, classmates and the World Health Organization (WHO) for continuing to serve the poor town of Sapad after completing his 2012-2014 assignment there.WHO called him an “unsung hero of public health.”“May he be an inspiration to those who dared to take the path less traveled—the path to the underserved and hard-to-reach areas of the country,” WHO said in a statement on Friday.Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial said Perlas would be given the Bayani ng Kalusugan award.The award, which was launched last year, recognizes “heroes of health” who have made significant contributions to the health and well-being of fellow Filipinos, particularly those who serve in remote areas.The DOH deplored the attack on Perlas and vowed “to support efforts until justice is served.”Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto urged PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa, to “make it his personal mission to find the killers of Dr. Dreyfuss Perlas.”“When a doctor is killed, the whole world gets sick.

"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been directed by the country’s privacy watchdog to cooperate with an investigation of the improper sharing of the personal information of more than 1 million Filipino users of the social media platform with the British political consulting company Cambridge Analytica.In an April 11 letter to Zuckerberg made public on Friday, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) said the investigation was intended “to determine whether there is unauthorized processing of personal data of Filipinos, and other possible violations of the Data Privacy Act.”The NPC’s move followed a decision by EU privacy watchdogs to look deeper into the harvesting of personal data from social networks for economic or political purposes.Outside the United States, the Philippines had the largest amount of user data acquired by Cambridge Analytica, with 1.18 million accounts in the country affected, according to the NPC.“As the Philippine data privacy authority, we are directing you to furnish this commission with information relevant to the processing of Facebook data of affected Filipinos, and how personal data is generally shared with third parties using your platform,” the NPC told Zuckerberg.“Submit to us the documents required within 15 days from receipt. The failure on your end to comply with these requirements will prompt us to take further corrective actions to protect the interests of Filipino data subjects,” the letter said.‘Improperly shared’The letter was signed by NPC Commissioner Raymund Liboro and his two deputies.It did not specify what actions the NPC would take if the documents were not submitted.The watchdog sought documentation on the actions taken by Facebook when it discovered the unauthorized processing of user data.Private data from about 87 million Facebook users worldwide was “improperly shared” by Cambridge Analytica through software developed by data scientist Aleksandr Kogan.The NPC noted that Kogan was required by Facebook to destroy the data that were collected and processed outside its terms of service and that Cambridge Analytica’s data science officer had confirmed the information was destroyed.“Kindly submit documentation between Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, and any evidence which led Facebook to believe that the data had indeed been destroyed, as well as any documentation of the extent of information shared between Facebook and Dr. Kogan, and from Dr. Kogan to Cambridge Analytica,” it added.A Facebook spokesperson said the company was committed to protecting people’s information and is engaged with the Philippines’ privacy watchdog.“We’ve recently made significant updates to make our privacy tools easier to find, restrict data access on Facebook, and make our terms and data policy clearer,” Facebook said.Recent research has shown Filipinos to be among the most active social media users in the world, spending on average more than four hours a day on platforms like Facebook.Cambridge Analytica has counted US President Donald Trump’s election campaign among its clients.A Hong Kong newspaper has said several people involved in President Duterte’s 2016 election campaign had met in 2015 with Alexander Nix, the now-suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica.Those people said the meeting with Nix was during a lunch break at an information technology seminar in Manila and there has been no contact since.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque on Tuesday said that Mr. Duterte’s election campaign did not rely on information bought from anybody, nor did it hire Cambridge Analytica’s services.Duterte campaignReturning from his trip to China on Thursday, Mr. Duterte dismissed reports that his campaign may have benefited from the Facebook data.“I had no Cambridge, Cambridge … All that I had was just a simple campaign,” Mr. Duterte said.He said that during a massive rally in Luneta days before the elections, he asked those who believe in God, in the priests and those against killing drug offenders not vote for him.“Then I said, ‘Those who want to go to hell and kill the druggies, vote for me.’ See what happened,” he said.“Also why would I pay that stupid Cambridge to run my campaign? The more I’ll lose,” he added.",1
"What’s wrong with being President Benigno Aquino III’s clone?Interior Secretary Mar Roxas on Saturday dismissed criticisms that he would merely be “Noynoy 2.0” after he was endorsed by President Aquino as the administration coalition’s presidential candidate in 2016.“What is wrong with Noy 2.0?” Roxas told reporters after the Mass commemorating the sixth death anniversary of former President Corazon Aquino at Manila Memorial Park.After President Aquino endorsed Roxas’ presidential bid, Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes said Roxas clearly only wanted to be “Noynoy 2.0,” noting the “symbols and colors” of the endorsement gathering at Club Filipino in Mandaluyong City and his speech.More of the same“He too will run in the name of Cory and Ninoy, in the name of daang matuwid (straight path), in the name of continuing Noynoy Aquino’s failed legacy. He promises us more of the same,” Reyes said in a statement.Reyes added that people “do not want a Noynoy 2.0,” saying reform program of Mr. Aquino was a “sham.”“The people demand real change,” Reyes said.But Roxas defended the accomplishments of the Aquino administration.He said the country was now in a place never reached or imagined before in five years because of President Aquino.“I don’t need to enumerate the statistics and proof but our country’s standing before the people and the world is now different than before,” he said.“I think we know, and the rest of the country knows, that what P-Noy has done, we have to continue them… I can contribute my experience and what I have done as well to enhance and strengthen the straight path that has been started,” Roxas said.Poe still considered for VPRoxas said Sen. Grace Poe remained one of the people he hoped would agree to be his vice-presidential running mate.“The short answer is yes,” Roxas said when asked if Poe remained on the Liberal Party’s list of potential candidates for Vice President.Roxas expressed hope that the public would accept and understand that having Poe as the coalition’s vice-presidential candidate is being considered.“This is not diminishing her stature. I respect her. For me this is part of a bigger plan that is generational. There is a saying that politicians think of the next elections, statesmen think of the next generation,” Roxas said.President Aquino had spoken several times with Poe about a possible coalition but all the meetings failed to bring any definitive decision.Poe is the front-runner in the presidential polls, followed by Vice President Jejomar Binay.Roxas is in third place in the Social Weather Stations poll and fourth, behind Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, in the Pulse Asia survey.Poe is the frontrunner in presidential surveys, with Vice President Jejomar Binay a close second. Roxas, on the other hand, lags behind the polls prompting President Aquino to urge supporters to campaign hard for Roxas to make him known to more people.Roxas said that President Aquino would still spearhead the meetings with possible vice presidential candidates of the Liberal Party.“We will get there. Honestly, I have not spoken to anyone. I am not speaking to anybody yet because I don’t want to preempt the President. Perhaps the talks and the deep reflection (on who will be the vice presidential candidate) will happen in the coming days,” Roxas said.RELATED STORIESMar Roxas still Aquino’s top choice as his successor in 2016Korina Sanchez on Mar Roxas’ endorsement: ‘Aquino has good taste’RELATED VIDEO",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte is considering the deployment of a Philippine Navy frigate to Libya to help secure the release of three Filipino engineers who were kidnapped by gunmen there.Speaking on Friday night in Malaybalay City, Bukidnon, the President made reference to the abduction of the three Filipinos and a South Korean national at a water project site in Western Libya.“[South] Korea has sent a ship there. You know I’m not joking, I will also send a frigate if they begin to hurt the three Filipinos there. I will really send one there,” he said in a mix of English and Filipino.‘I’ll send two’“Korea sent one … So I might send one, too. What should we send … A frigate. I’ll send two,” the President added.The Navy has three 50-year-old frigates, all Hamilton-class former cutters acquired from the US Coast Guard. Unlike the sophisticated Korean frigate, “Munmu the Great,” not one of the Philippine warships boasts a missile system.Mr. Duterte said he would discuss his proposal with the military and police during a joint command conference next week.‘Blast those pirates’Addressing the Filipinos’ kidnappers, Mr. Duterte said, “Don’t treat us like that, [or] I will cut your heads off.”The President warned that he would order the Navy to seek out the kidnappers if they harmed the hostages.“I’ll tell them to blast them,” he said. “Those pirates, blast them … if they don’t want to release the hostages.”Armed men abducted the three Filipino engineers and the South Korean project consultant during a July 6 attack on a water project site in the Libyan desert.",1
"I’m pro-death penalty for economic reasons. We’re talking extreme types of criminals here, the ones who pose a serious threat to society, the ones who are impossible to reform. The ones who rape three-month-old babies or hack their fathers to death and eat their internal organs because they’re high on shabu. Why should a poor country like the Philippines waste government funds to house, feed, and guard monsters like these, when that money can be used to help poor young children instead, who can still be molded into responsible and productive members of society?When the debates on the death penalty start at the Senate, I hope someone (maybe Manny Pacquiao) will show data on how much the government spends each year on the prison system, and compute how many children can be fed and sent to school with that amount of money. Our taxes should be used to benefit law-abiding citizens, not to keep inhuman criminals alive.I also hope the senate gives a voice to survivors of heinous crimes (or the relatives of victims who died), because they’re the ones who can credibly speak on the death penalty, not clueless yellow morons like Kiko Pangilinan, Risa Hontiveros, and Bam Aquino who have no idea what it’s like to live with the risk of getting raped, robbed, or killed in the most brutal way by crazed shabu addicts everyday.If Hontiveros has another one of her idiotic little girl monologues about the worst criminals changing for the better, please send her to the Abu Sayyaff’s lair in Mindanao by herself with no media, no, no guards. If she can do that, then maybe we can listen to her.Another thing, please leave the God-God arguments out of the debates. You are the Senate, dammit. Demonstrate to the country what separation of church and state means. Don’t use religion to argue your case. Religion is your personal choice, not the law of the land.If the Catholic priests start yakking again, draft a provision to tax them and include it in the constitutional amendments. If priests want to have a say in government, they need to pay like the rest of the taxpayers in this country. The Catholic church makes millions every day collecting alms from people, but where’s the money? How come so many people are still poor and helpless in their parishes? The priests keep saying the government should show mercy to criminals, but have they ever donated some of their millions to build better prisons? Have they ever done anything concrete to reduce drugs and crime in their communities?A person’s right to life comes with the responsibility to respect the right to life of others. If you violate the right to life of another person, you forfeit your own right to life.The only exception is if the victim of your crime (or their relatives) pardons you and gives the justice system permission to let you live.As a citizen, I don’t think the death penalty should be used lightly, but I do want to see it there in the law as an extra option that the courts and the police can use in extreme cases.Simple logic–there’s nothing to lose by having it there. If it doesn’t turn out to be an effective deterrent, we’re not worse off from where we are now. But if it does turn out to be effective, we gain a lot.-------------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment. Join the discussion",0
"Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV saw a glimmer of hope in the country’s justice system on Monday when Judge Andres Soriano of the Makati Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 148 refused to order his arrest for coup d’état after President Rodrigo Duterte voided his 2011 amnesty.“We want to thank Judge Soriano. Single-handedly, he upheld justice and the rule of law in our country despite the extreme pressure coming from the Duterte regime,” Trillanes told reporters after receiving a copy of the decision denying the petition of the Department of Justice (DOJ).“We now see that there is hope in our country. And he is personified by Judge Soriano,” Trillanes added.The President voided Trillanes’ amnesty in August, claiming the former military rebel failed to apply for amnesty and admit guilt in military mutinies against the government in 2003, 2006 and 2007.The DOJ asked the Makati RTC Branches 148 and 150 to reopen the coup d’état and rebellion cases against Trillanes and order his arrest.He applied for amnestyIn the rebellion case, Judge Elmo Alameda of the Makati RTC Branch 150 ruled for the government on Sept. 25. He ordered Trillanes’ arrest but allowed him bail.But Judge Soriano found that based on evidence presented, Trillanes filed an application for amnesty in 2011 and with it his admission of guilt.In denying the DOJ’s motion, Soriano said the court’s decision to dismiss the coup d’état charges against Trillanes in 2011, after he was granted amnesty by then President Benigno Aquino III, had become final and executory.Soriano said there was “no reason to disturb” the long-established judicial doctrine that asserts that final and executory decisions were “immutable.”“The court, in fact, loses jurisdiction over the case when its decision has become final and executory,” Soriano said.“The law is vibrant. Jurisprudence is its lifeblood,” the judge said. “Subsequent jurisprudence may forge new horizons in which exceptions to the immutability of a final and executory judgment may be born.”Soriano said, however, that his court would not be the one to set such a precedent.But the judge also ruled that it was within President’s power to issue Proclamation No. 572, which voided Trillanes’ amnesty.“Proclamation No. 572 is purely an executive act and prerogative in the exercise of the President’s power of control and supervision over all offices and agencies of the executive department,” Soriano said.He said Trillanes failed to prove that the order “breached any constitutional guaranty, or that it has encroached on the constitutional power of either the judicial or the executive branch.”DOJ to appealMalacañang said it respected the court’s decision.“The Palace respects the constitutional independence of the judiciary and it will continue to do so,” presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a statement.Panelo also welcomed Soriano’s affirmation of Proclamation No. 572.“It signifies that this administration is not engaged in the political persecution of its critics but is only enforcing the law against anyone who goes against its command,” he said.Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said Trillanes could not claim victory, as Soriano’s ruling was not yet final.He said the DOJ would appeal the decision to a higher court.Trillanes said he expected the Duterte administration to continue going after him, but that he was “energized” to face such a threat.“They will intensify their efforts, they will be more zealous, but I will be more energized to face them,” he said.‘Nothing changes’Trillanes said he would continue to do his job of opposing wrongdoing, and he would not be driven by hate.“Nothing changes. I will be the same critic as I was before. I’m just upholding my role in our democracy as a member of the opposition,” he said.He stressed that his role was crucial in a democracy.“Those who are tired of me, don’t be because this is me. Just do your thing. Democracy needs people like me who will call out the mistakes of the administration and its abuses,” he said.The next battlefield is the Supreme Court, where Trillanes has a pending petition challenging the constitutionality of the President’s proclamation voiding his amnesty.",1
" that devastated Puerto Rico, and now, extremely hot weather that has caused forest fires in southern California.The world’s scientists are agreed that all this extreme weather is related to rising temperatures on the planet. These are, in turn, caused by the excessive carbon emissions from industries in many countries. The heat is causing the polar glaciers to melt and it is feared that this will cause ocean levels to rise, inundating low-lying islands around the world. The Philippines, with many islands, would be among the first to suffer.We thus hope that the world’s nations that pledged at the Paris Conference on Climate Change in 2015 to limit the carbon emissions of their industries will succeed in their goals so that the totality of their efforts will achieve the desired goal of keeping world temperatures down. In the meantime, w will have to cope as best as we can with the powerful typhoons like Yolanda in 2013 and the rainy storms like Urduja that just hit Biliran, Leyte, and Samar.",1
"The Philippine Coast Guard has deployed a ship and a plane to patrol the Philippine Rise, a resource-rich part of Philippine territory that some experts feared was also being encroached by China.The Coast Guard, according to spokesperson Capt. Armand Balilo, on Saturday sent an Islander aircraft, a propeller-driven plane, and the BRP Suluan, a multi-role response vessel, to Philippine Rise (formerly Benham Rise) to conduct patrols in the area in tandem.‘Eyes’Balilo said the ship and plane left Legazpi City in Albay province for the vast underwater plateau that is part of Philippine territory off the coast of Aurora province.The Coast Guard vessels, said Balilo, “would serve as our ‘eyes’ in the area as part of our maritime patrols.”The deployment came after Coast Guard chief, Rear Admiral Elson Hermogino, received instructions from President Duterte for the Coast Guard to activate patrols in Philippine Rise, which is believed to be teeming with natural gas, oil and other marine resources.Passage allowedThe BRP Suluan would embark on a two-week tour of duty and would be replaced by another Coast Guard vessel.As the Philippine Rise was known as an international navigation route, civilian ships from other countries would be allowed to pass through the area.“They would be allowed to pass but they would not be allowed to conduct any illegal activities in the area,” Balilo said.Mr. Duterte had threatened to go to war with any country that would encroach into Philippine Rise to either explore or occupy the area. Former human rights lawyer Harry Roque, presidential spokesperson, later clarified that Mr. Duterte’s rant was not aimed at China.In Davao City on Thursday, the President repeated his rant against foreign entities that would intrude into Philippine Rise.“You start to f*ck with the area there I’ll go to war,” he said. He told soldiers to be steadfast in defending Philippine territory. “Don’t be afraid, I’ll join you,” the President said.",1
"The most awaited day has finally arrived. Men and women across the nation suspended in a state of anticipation suddenly break out in jubilant cheers, high fives and hip hip hoorays as the initial partial results from COMELEC come in revealing what the surveys and rally crowd sizes have been saying all along – Mayor Rody Duterte in an enormous skyrocketing lead over the rest of the contenders.As of this writing, though results may not be complete yet (roughly half of votes counted so far), it is already crystal clear. So I and everyone who has been longing for change during these past 30 years marked by “democracy” and “growth” that never really became inclusive wish to extend our most heartfelt congratulations to our new leader, the 16th President of the Republic of the Philippines, President Rodrigo “Rody” “Digong” Roa Duterte.Relishing the VictoryJust how significant and momentous a victory this is for the Filipino people is yet to be fully grasped, but one thing’s for sure – all the struggles to bring about this first step of change, all the battles it took to get to this peak were worth it.Now is a moment to relish that fresh new breeze this victory brings – the air of hope blowing across the isles of this beautiful yet battered and torn archipelago. Change is coming they say, and the first phase of its realization has finally taken shape in the person of a strong, respectable, experienced, iron-willed, incorrupt and competent leader – one who, for a change, has the proven Midas touch. It is time to stand in attention and offer a salute to the man of the hour.It is a time to dream again, to close our eyes and envision a Philippines that is clean & orderly and where men, women and children are disciplined and use their God-given common sense and intellect; a country that can stand tall again among the brotherhood of nations, not because of some vacuous Pinoy pride beholden to a Yellow Queen, but because it’s people love their country the way Du30 kisses the red, blue and white banner in every rally throughout his campaign.We All WinAfter all the noise, hustle and bustle in recent days of the campaign leading to the elections, everyone in each camp must feel exhausted, even just by the suffocating atmosphere of mudslinging and fighting among supporters and candidates of opposing camps that enveloped the nation.Even if you are a supporter of a camp whose candidate lost, that initial feeling of sadness, anger or depression sinks in and just like some bitter pill one needs to swallow, it all dissolves away in a few fleeting moments of silent realization that the only thing to do is accept reality, be a good sport and move on.We all win – if after the fight, we come over and congratulate the victors. We win if we did not do anything to harm the integrity of the elections. We win if we accept our loss, unite with our new president and support his vision and policies to effect our much needed change.We win if we follow our new president’s simple command to STOP IT – Stop all the things (criminal activities, drugs, scams, incompetence, corruption) that destroy the castle and kingdom that President Duterte is bringing all of us together to build. We win if we salute and respect the man chosen to lead the charge of victory towards freedom from our true bondage: the fetters of our very own destructive dysfunctional Pinoy traits.We have brought back the strongman. But we will not really need a dictator for president IF we all look into the mirror and realize that the main problem of this country is simply the person staring right back at you.It’s time for CHANGE. Bring it on President Duterte, bring it on![Photo courtesy The Telegraph UK.]",0
"President Rodrigo Duterte said the only reason Justice Secretary Leila de Lima finally decided to use her long-time whistleblower, self-confess killer Edgar Matobato, was because she has been pinned down as the queen of the illegal drug trade inside the National Bilibid Prison.In a speech in Cagayan de Oro last Thursday, Duterte said de Lima had Matobato as a potential attack dog against him as the self-confessed Davao Death Squad was accepted in the government’s witness protection program as early as 2014 when de Lima was still Justice Secretary.“Ngayon naging senador, daldal nang daldal, daldal nang daldal, sabi niya ‘yung si Matobato was with them sa Witness Protection Program for three years. Ngayon na lang niya binitawan kasi naiipit na siya,” said Duterte.In the House probe on illegal drugs, the Department of Justice had brought 30 high-profile inmates and resource persons all of whom testified how de Lima used the convicted kidnapper and drug lord JayBee Sebastian to raise funds for her campaign and to consolidate the nerve center of the country’s drug right smack inside the NBP by foiling efforts of the police and drug agents to bring down the drug alliance.Duterte said his alleged DDS ties have long been used by his politiko rivals in previous elections to no avail as he never lost an election in the last three decades.He said de Lima used the same tactic as early as 2008 as she wanted to use him as a stepping stone to climb to the top of the political stage.",0
"The youth should not believe in the historical revisionism, especially on the tenure of Ferdinand Marcos as the country’s president.“I am urging my fellow youth not to subscribe to the negative brand of historical revisionism,” appealed James Peñas of the University of the Philippines Visayas (UP Visayas).“Instead of telling what happened, they are hiding lies,” Peñas told Manila Bulletin during a Friday protest rally in Iloilo City that marked the 46th anniversary of Marcos’ martial law.Since the start of 2016 election campaign, pages popped up on social media networking site Facebook that glorified the Marcos years.This was especially denounced by youth groups after Ferdinand “Bongbong”Marcos Jr. was the vice presidential running mate of the late Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago.But Peñas expressed optimism that some members of the youth have been enlightened and not easily believe what is being peddled online.Almost two weeks ago, the scheduled student forum featuring Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos in Iloilo City was scrapped.This is as students and activists staged protest outside the campus of the Iloilo Science and Technology University (ISAT-U).Meanwhile, Friday’s protest outside the Iloilo Provincial Capitol drew left-leaning groups who burned an effigy of President Duterte.",1
"Philippine Senators are having so much fun with investigative hearings “in aid of legislation.” The hearings not only provide them the opportunity to have their few minutes of fame. It also helps distract from the fact that they are part of a do-nothing Senate.Risa Hontiveros is one Senator who basks in the pleasure of Senate hearings, whether it’s about ‘fake news,” illegal drugs or whatever.So today, she called for a Senate hearing on the alleged missing PhilHealth Funds amounting to P1.7 billion, during the time that she was connected with the health insurance agency.For starters, she had summoned herself to be one of the resource persons for the hearing.Very Sunset Boulevard: ”Mr. DeMille, I’m ready for my close-up”",0
"“You can’t put a good Mar down.”Pushing aggressively for his anointed one at a Friday night campaign rally here, President Benigno Aquino III said that of all the candidates for President, only Mar Roxas has the characteristics and track record to be a capable leader of the country.He said voters should elect someone who has the “capability, experience, conscience, honesty in words and deed, humility, and concern and love for others.”Roxas has created many job opportunities such as in the information technology and business process outsourcing industry where employment could reach almost 1.3 million and investments would bring in at least $25 billion this year, the President said.READ: Roxas in meet and greet with Cebu City BPO workers“He also knows how to find solutions to any challenge that a President would face. All this Mar does without any complaint, without any drama, without doing any self-promotion. And despite a torrent of potshots from his political opponents, he continues to work. It’s true: You can’t put a good Mar down,” Mr. Aquino said.Thousands of supporters wearing the signature Aquino yellow adopted by the Liberal Party-led administration slate turned up at Plaza Quezon here for the campaign rally. The crowd started shrieking when they saw on the wide screen onstage that the President had arrived.Mr. Aquino has vowed to campaign hard for Roxas, vice presidential candidate Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo and the entire Liberal Party-led administration senatorial slate to “preserve” the gains of his administration.Though he never said so, it seemed that the President’s strong pitch for Roxas was his way of neutralizing the allegations that Sen.

"Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa said his first year as chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP) was marked by a series of ups and downs, particularly the relative success of the war on drugs and the involvement of rogue police officers in illegal activities.“It’s like one of the rides in the amusement park, the Anchor’s Away. It would suddenly go very high and would suddenly go down until you feel that your balls are being vacuumed,” said dela Rosa.“That’s how I would describe my first year. You have to ride on it if you want to know how does it feel,” he added.GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWSDela Rosa said that the highs of his career as PNP chief are the times when he would go out and personally receive praises and expression of gratitude from ordinary people who cited and commended the national police force’s efforts to keep the populace safe.The lows of his stint as PNP chief include controversial such as the abduction and murder of a South Korean executive right inside Camp Crame and the recent violent manhandling of local ordinance violators by two Mandaluyong City police officers.“Wherever you would go, even abroad, they would thank you. And then you would go back to Camp Crame, only to find out that a South Korean was killed here that makes me feel like resigning,” said dela Rosa.Dela Rosa, however, said he has no regrets so far, and that he is getting used to the challenges of being the PNP chief.WINNING THE WARDela Rosa likewise pointed out that the government is winning the relentless war against illegal drugs, a year after it was launched by President Duterte.“If you ask me if I am satisfied, yes I am satisfied. We are winning the war,” dela Rosa stressed.Based on latest PNP data, more than 3,000 suspected drug pushers and users were killed in various legitimate police operations across the country since the Duterte administration took over.“The illegal drugs war will continue. We will live and die on drugs war, this administration will live and die on war on drugs. No retreat,” said dela Rosa.KILLINGSA separate PNP data disclosed that a total of 12,833 murder and homicide cases were recorded by the PNP from July 1 last year to June 15 this year, with a total of 14,140 victims.Of the figure, which is classified by critics as extra-judicial killings, the PNP data stated that 2,098 of the cases proved to be with motives related to illegal drugs while 2,535 cases are non-drug related.A total of 3, 194 cases were already filed in court, wherein 1,810 of those cases are those with suspects arrested.A total of 8,200 cases are still being investigated by the police.DRUG WAR AND LOW CRIME RATEThe PNP chief said the success of the war on drugs can also be gauged by the significant crime rate decline.He said that the crime rate dropped by 27 percent, compared to the same period last year or before the war on drugs was launched.The PNP has been maintaining that the proliferation of illegal drugs is linked to crimes.“Go out there in the street and talk to ordinary people. If they don’t feel safe, then it is our failure but if they feel safer now compared past year, then we are successful,” said dela Rosa.",1
"The University of Santo Tomas law dean, Nilo Divina, has brought two separate libel suits against lawyer Lorna Kapunan, alleging that she has maligned his reputation by linking him to the fatal hazing of Horacio Castillo III, a freshman law student of UST, and for making public a disbarment case that has been filed against him and 20 of his law firm associates.In the complaints he filed in the prosecutor’s office of Manila and Quezon City, Divina sought a total of P120 million in damages from Kapunan, who he said had also made stinging remarks against him in the media regarding the failed impeachment attempt against Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chair Andres Bautista.“Due to the malicious public imputations made by respondent, I suffered and continue to suffer irreparable damage to my reputation, honor and good standing in the academe, legal and business community, as well as in the eyes of the general public,” Divina said in the complaint he filed in the Quezon City prosecutor’s office.Kapunan declined to comment, saying she had yet to read the two complaints.She is the primary counsel of the Comelec chief’s estranged wife, Patricia Bautista, and Castillo’s parents, who had lodged a murder complaint in the Department of Justice against members of Aegis Juris, the UST fraternity that counts Divina among its members.Divina included Patricia Bautista as respondent in one of the libel suits, alleging that she and Kapunan announced the disbarment complaint that the Comelec chief’s wife lodged against Divina and 20 other lawyers of the Divina law firm in the Supreme Court.Patricia Bautista has claimed that the UST law dean had given commissions to the Comelec chief for referring clients to Divina Law firm.Divina also accused Kapunan and Patricia Bautista of violating Section 7 of Republic Act No. 10175, or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, as Kapunan’s interview on ABS-CBN was also posted on the television network’s website.“Respondent, in one fell swoop, has tarnished the good name I have scrupulously built through hard work and good deeds over the years with her inane and fabricated allegations,” Divina said, referring to Kapunan.",1
"Whether Christopher “Bong” Go was running for senator or not could be a good case study of how to separate words from action.In Agusan del Sur, Go kept saying he was not seeking a Senate seat, but he apparently basked in the attention given him by people or groups egging him to run.Hundreds of people, attending the six-day Naliyagan Festival, wore T-shirts with the words “Push to GO Senate tayo,” “Go Bong Go” and “Ready Set Go,” slogans that were obviously a play on the surname of the most trusted aide of President Rodrigo Duterte.A four-minute documentary was shown featuring Go’s feats and calling him “gateway to the mayor” and “President’s gate.”Go took the stage and said this: “I don’t want to talk about politics here because I don’t have the intention to run” for senator.Later, he said: “I leave my fate to God.”",1
"British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered a huge blow on Thursday as Dominic Raab quit as her Brexit secretary over a proposed EU withdrawal agreement.May was preparing to start selling her Brexit deal to parliament, boosted by news that Europe is preparing a rapid summit to sign off on the agreement.But the ground began to shift beneath her when Raab said he could not back the draft deal.“I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto,” he said.“You deserve a Brexit secretary who can make the case for the deal you are pursuing with conviction.“I must resign.”Raab, who had been in place since July, resigned less than an hour after Shailesh Vara quit as a junior Northern Ireland minister over the draft accord.The pound sterling lost nearly one percent of its value against the dollar following Raab’s resignation, wiping out gains since Tuesday as the draft agreement emerged.At 0900 GMT, the pound stood at around $1.2870, compared to $1.2992 at 2200 GMT on Wednesday.May had secured her cabinet’s collective approval for the agreement during a five-hour meeting on Wednesday, an important step that helped allay growing fears in the business community of a disorderly divorce.She was due to set out the terms of the draft withdrawal agreement with the European Union to parliament’s lower House of Commons, which must approve the deal before Brexit day on March 29.European Council President Donald Tusk said in Brussels that unless problems emerge as EU member states examine the deal, he will host a summit to sign the accord in Brussels on November 25.May’s governing center-right Conservative Party—which does not command a Commons majority—was already split between Brexiteers and those who wanted to remain in the union, and now many on both sides of that divide oppose her deal.Raab had backed Britain leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum, while Vara wanted the UK to stay in the bloc.‘Threat’ to UK unityIn quitting the cabinet, Raab said he believed the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presented a “very real threat” to the United Kingdom’s integrity.Raab added that he was opposed to “an indefinite backstop arrangement” to guarantee the Irish border remains free-flowing, saying the EU would hold “a veto over our ability to exit.”Vara said the withdrawal agreement fails to leave Britain as a “sovereign, independent country.”The outraged response by many MPs to the deal has heightened concerns that even when finalised, it will not pass parliament.Hardline Brexit supporters have cried betrayal over the agreement’s vision of a close future relationship between Britain and the EU.May insisted it “brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement (of people), protects jobs, security and our union.”But she conceded there were “difficult days ahead” as she seeks to woo MPs.Speaking in Brussels, Tusk said EU member states would have until Tuesday next week to examine the deal and to agree the wording of a parallel political statement setting out goals for the bloc’s future relations with London.Ater that, preparations will begin for an EU summit on the following Sunday to sign the deal.“As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, both for you and for us,” said Tusk.The deal covers citizens’ rights, Britain’s financial settlement and plans for a post-Brexit transition period during which both sides hope to agree a new trade deal.The most controversial element is the “backstop” plan to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU until a trade deal is agreed that avoids the need for border checks with Ireland.Many Brexiteers fear this would leave Britain a “vassal state”, tied to the bloc indefinitely.‘No Brexit?’In a statement outside Downing Street late Wednesday, May said her deal was “the best that could be negotiated.”She said if MPs rejected it they faced Britain leaving without agreement, which experts says could lead to potentially catastrophic economic and legal disruption.She also raised the risk of “no Brexit at all”, a warning likely intended for her euroskeptic MPs but which was seized upon with enthusiasm by campaigners for a second referendum.A small but growing number of Conservative MPs back a second vote with the option to stay in the EU, although May has rejected the idea.

"For lack of evidence and on the intercession of a cabinet official, police and military authorities freed 11 individuals arrested before dawn Monday on suspicion of possessing two homemade bombs and other explosives at a house inside the Mindanao State University (MSU) main campus in Marawi City, the MSU leadership disclosedTuesday.“They (11 arrested persons) were released because they were found out to be legitimate professionals and business people, not terrorists as suspected,” MSU president Dr. Habib Macaayong told The Manila Bulletin over the phone.Macaayong said the Marawi City-based Army’s 103rd Infantry Brigade, which coordinated the raid with the Philippine National Police (PNP) Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) elements, released the 11 persons a few hours after their arrest.He said the suspects’ release followed a call from Presidential Adviser on Overseas Affairs and Muslim Concerns Abdullah Mama-o, who vouched for the innocence of the arrested individuals.Macaayong added the house raided by CIDG and Army operatives past 12 a.m. Monday was owned by Sacar Macadindang, a registered engineer working in Saudi Arabia who went home early this month to attend to the graduation of his child at the MSU main campus last January 25.The graduation ceremony was graced by PNP Director General Ronald Dela Rosa, who had studied in MSU for three years until 1982.Macaayong said the MSU security group and the provincial police office were pursing witnesses’ accounts that the two homemade bombs and other ammunition purportedly discovered at the house of Macadindang were “planted.”He did not discount the possibility that the raid could be part of a series of smear campaigns aimed at discrediting the present MSU leadership.“There still are some people trying to discredit our administration, dreaming to grab (MSU) leadership,” he said.Macaayong cited as another possible “destabilization plot” the case of two civilian visitors of the MSU campus who have reportedly remained missing, including their brand new van since January 26 after attending the graduation rites.He named the visitors as Boboy and Thelma Bagnol. The two were believed to have been held up while traveling from Marawi City to Iligan City, he said.",1
"Congress cannot just pass the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) because the establishment of a new autonomous region for Muslims in Mindanao requires the amendment or revision of the 1987 Constitution, according to a draft report prepared by the Senate committee on constitutional amendments and revision of codes.“The Bangsamoro has much merit, but its promulgation requires constitutional amendment or revision; mere legislation will not suffice, and will spark Supreme Court litigation,” said the report drafted by the committee headed by Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago.The 27-page draft committee report, a copy of which was obtained by the Inquirer, is now being circulated among the panel’s members. So far, according to sources, it has been signed by seven senators, including acting Senate Minority Leader Vicente Sotto III and Sen. Teofisto Guingona III. Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told reporters on Monday that he had signed the draft report.The draft report may be consolidated with the report of the committee on local government headed by Marcos, which continues to hold hearings on the BBL jointly with the committee on peace, unification and reconciliation headed by Guingona.In the summary of the draft report, Santiago’s committee said the BBL effectively “seeks to change certain constitutional provisions on local autonomy.”Invalid“Notwithstanding the peace-driven merits of the bill, it cannot be promulgated by means of a mere legislation by Congress. It has to be promulgated by nothing less than an amendment to the Constitution,” the report said.“In its present state,” the report said, the proposed BBL “raises many insidious doubts on constitutionality” and raised two points.First, the measure failed to conform to the constitutional provision for the establishment of “autonomous regions in Muslim Mindanao … within the framework of this Constitution, and the national sovereignty, as well as territorial integrity” of the republic.Second, President Aquino, as head of the executive branch of government, appointed a peace panel to negotiate with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), resulting in the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB).Thus, the report said, the proposed BBL would be “ultra vires” (invalid) because “although a simple government office negotiated with a nongovernment organized group, the result would be to amend the Constitution.”The report said “[t]he BBL, pursuant to the CAB, reorganizes and restructures the powers of [the] government, thus usurping the sovereignty [that] the Constitution defines as residing in the people.”State within PH stateExamining the sovereignty issue, the report said the changes sought by the BBL “conspire to create a part-sovereign state or a substate, meaning a political community in which part of the powers of external sovereignty are exercised by the home government, and part are vested in or controlled by some other political body or bodies.”“[T]he BBL creates an entire state within the Philippine state,” the report said.It said the proposed BBL sought to allow the Bangsamoro government the power to diminish national sovereignty in providing it with three different kinds of power—reserved, concurrent (it shares power with the national government) and exclusive (Bangsamoro on occasion even exercises power independently of the national government).“Many powers, functions and responsibilities are sought to be transferred to the internal sovereignty of the Bangsamoro government, which is supposed to have coequal status with the national government,” the report said, adding that the Bangsamoro government under the BBL would be a “part-sovereign state” or a “substate,” which was “never intended nor ever approved by the Philippine Constitution.”On the issue of autonomy, the report said while the BBL was said to be an exercise of local autonomy, “it bursts its bounds and turns into a part-sovereign state or substate.”For instance, it noted that the term “Bangsamoro territory” implied that while it was under the jurisdiction of the Philippines, it was “separate” and that with the use of the “questionable” phrase “Bangsamoro people,” the proposed law “takes a slippery path toward a Bangsamoro electoral code that might limit suffrage to membership of the Bangsamoro government and the Bangsamoro people.”Form of gov’tThe report also said the proposed BBL provided for a parliamentary form of government within a presidential form of government and that there was no constitutional basis for changing the form of government.This violates the constitutional provision that “the organic act shall define the basic structure of government for the region consisting of the executive department and the legislative assembly, both of which shall be elective and representative of the consequent political units,” the report said.On the issue of “substate” or “less-than-sovereign state,” the report said this was not contemplated by the Constitution.“The BBL seeks to establish a political entity so far unknown in the rest of constitutional democracies. While the Constitution takes care to define the limits of local autonomy, the BBL is vested with powers far beyond constitutional limits,” it said.The report pointed out that the BBL would limit the powers of Congress because while Congress will be entitled to reserved powers, the Bangsamoro would be excluded from the laws passed by the legislature with respect to autonomous regions.Issuing own laws unacceptableAlso deemed “unacceptable” by the report was the provision granting the Bangsamoro parliament powers to issue its own laws, “which could have the same binding national character as congressional enactments.” This would “render the BBL defenseless were it placed under judicial scrutiny in the Supreme Court,” the report said.On territorial integrity, the report said the proposed BBL provided that the Bangsamoro would have exclusive powers and use of natural resources as long as they were found in the Bangsamoro. This is contrary to international law and constitutional law, it said.The report also held as questionable the provision that would allow the Bangsamoro government to “have authority and jurisdiction over the exploration, development and utilization of mines and mineral resources in its territory.”It also pointed out the BBL’s reference to the autonomous region as a “territory” when the proposed law had “no power to create the Bangsamoro territory.”“There is no objection to the establishment of autonomy on a territorial basis for the Bangsamoro. However, it has to be pointed out that the right of indigenous populations to self-determination is restricted to autonomy and self-governance,” it said.Four concernsThe report also raised four concerns about the proposed BBL.The reference to the BBL as a “basic law” when to judges and lawyers this is a synonym for constitutional law and organic law.“Thus, the BBL, by its own terms, is intended, by those who drafted it to have the same effect as the “constitution” or “constitutional law” of the territory that is designated as the “Bangsamoro” and the proposed law then “intended to have the same primacy and consequences as the constitution of the territory of the Bangsamoro as the 1987 Constitution in the territory” of the republic.“But it goes without saying that two different constitutional instruments cannot have legal effect at the same time and in the same territory,” it said.The peace effort between the government and the MILF was a discussion between the government of a sovereign state and a group of rebels seeking either to overthrow or secede from that sovereign state.The report said peace was ordinarily discussed after a military victory over the rebels but peace negotiations were “not a substitute for military success.”Give ‘forceful’ meaningIt also noted that there were other secessionist groups besides the MILF, mentioning the Moro Nationalist Liberation Front (MNLF) as an example.The need to give “forceful” meaning to the sentence in the BBL that the “Bangsamoro territory shall remain part of the Philippines.”“The general statement must not be contradicted or emasculated by the details of the resulting structures and institutions of the Bangsamoro entity,” the draft report said.The Senate committee noted the BBL provision that to expand on the Bangsamoro territory, a simple resolution was needed of the local government or a petition of at least 10 percent of the voters of a contiguous land area and a “popular ratification” within the area.It said the structures and processes set up by the republic’s administrative law “may be expected to be modified or swept away by acts of the Bangsamoro.”“This is not something that can be authorized to be done by any state or regulation enacted by the Congress. The 10 percent of registered voters of a contiguous local government unit cannot simply push away or ignore what the 90 percent wish to do,” the report said.The committee also cited the need for particular and detailed attention to the proposed distribution of governmental powers and functions between the government and the Bangsamoro.“Note that the government will have fewer and limited functions and duties than the Bangsamoro government in respect of matters touching the daily lives of people. Constitutional amendments will be required to put the redistribution of powers envisaged by the proposed BBL into effect,” the report said.Redistribution of powersThe committee noted that the Bangsamoro government would be financially supported by the national government, a “truly extraordinary situation.”“Effectively, the Bangsamoro government will have seceded from, and been allowed to do so by, the government,” the report said.Fails 2-fold testsIn conclusion, the committee said the BBL “fails the twofold test set by the Constitution” and that was in the contexts of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity.The committee noted that the BBL was presented as a way to achieve peace in Mindanao, but added that “the end does not justify the means.”“The problem with [the] BBL as an experiment in both creative and innovative political values is that it makes no mention of the possible various consequences of such an experiment in domestic governance,” it said.RecommendationsThe committee made two recommendations:“Instead of implying a transfer of sovereignty from the national government to the Bangsamoro government, the BBL should observe the principle of subsidiarity (the doctrine that the power to make local decisions should be vested with local authorities and not with a dominant central aggregation) as a way to allocate decision-making power, but there must be a limit to the amount of division of competencies.”The BBL “should provide for a minimal threshold of competencies under which national sovereignty may not be limited or shared.”RELATED STORIESBBL ‘may need constitutional surgery’Davide offers ‘play of terminologies’ to resolve contested BBL provisions",1
"China dispatched its highest-level envoy to North Korea in two years on Friday in a bid to improve chilly relations after President Donald Trump last week urged Beijing to pressure Pyongyang to cease its nuclear weapons program.Song Tao will report on the outcomes of China’s ruling Communist Party congress held last month and visit counterparts in his role as President Xi Jinping’s special envoy, according to Chinese state media. China has given no other details about his itinerary or said whether he’ll meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Song heads the Communist Party’s International Department and holds the rank of minister.China on Thursday said a “dual suspension” proposal to handle North Korea was still the best option, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping had rejected a “freeze for freeze” agreement.North Korea’s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles has fueled a surge in regional tensions as United Nations-led sanctions appear to have failed to bite deeply enough to change its behavior.China and Russia have proposed that the United States and South Korea stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs.Beijing formally calls the idea the “dual suspension” proposal.Speaking upon his return from Asia on Wednesday, Trump said he and Xi had agreed that they would not accept a “freeze for freeze” idea, which China’s foreign minister announced in March.Asked how China understood Trump’s remarks and whether he agreed with the characterization of what Trump said he agreed to with Xi, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said only through talks that addressed all sides’ legitimate security concerns could there be a peaceful resolution.“We believe that the ‘dual suspension’ proposal is the most feasible, fair and sensible plan in the present situation,” Geng told a daily news briefing.“Not only can it relieve the present tense situation, it can also resolve all parties most pressing security concerns, and provide an opportunity and create conditions to resume talks, and find a breakthrough point to get out of trouble,” he added.",1
"thus justifying Trump’s imposition of tariffs.– Quest for a joint statement –Trudeau told Trump that it was “unacceptable” to impose tariffs on national security grounds when he had a one-on-one with the US leader.“The Prime Minister pressed the President to reconsider the US tariffs imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum, and encouraged him to work with Canada to address unfair trade,” Trudeau’s office said.But Trump talked up the prospect that some kind of face-saving formula could be found.“I think we’ll have a joint statement,” he said as he appeared alongside Trudeau.Officials worked late into the night in an effort to reach an agreement, while the leaders enjoyed a campfire chat and a performance by acrobats from the Cirque du Soleil.The summit is wrapping up just as Chinese President Xi Jinping begins hosting the leaders of Russia and Iran at a two-day regional security meeting in a symbol of the powerplay between East and West.The G7 gathering is being held at a luxury resort more than two hours’ drive from Quebec City, where there have been several small and relatively trouble-free protests.Trump’s courting of the US victims of globalization was a major factor in his rise to power, and his willingness to break up multilateral agreements such as the Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate accord have also played well with his core support.But allies who had grown accustomed to US leadership are now openly alarmed about the future under Trump.“What worries me most is the fact that the rules-based international order is being challenged, quite surprisingly not by the usual suspects but by its main architect and guarantor, the US,” European Council President Donald Tusk said on Friday.",1
"Bureau of Customs (BoC) Commissioner Isidro Lapeña has confirmed that former customs chief Nicanor Faeldon received not P100-million, but P107-million “pasalubong” or welcome gift, according to Senator Panfilo “Ping” Lacson.In an interview over ANC Headstart yesterday, Lacson said Lapeña confided to him in his office that Faeldon got P107-million before attending a Senate hearing on the P6.4-billion shabu shipment.Lacson, in his privilege speech earlier at the Senate, alleged Faeldon was involved in the so-called “tara” system prevalent in the BOC despite the latter’s persistent denial.“No less than Commissioner Lapeña testified. He confirmed that indeed there is the pasalubong money. And he confided to me: ‘Sir hindi P100-million but P107-million yung inabot (sa kanya),” Lacson said.Lapeña, according to Lacson, admitted he discovered it because he too experienced being given a welcome gift right after President Duterte assigned him to take over the BOC following corruption allegations against Faeldon.“Somebody whispered to him na ang source, or one of the sources, at least yung tax credit certificates (TCCs) kasi in bulk (yun),” the senator said.",1
"Despite the controversy, the Department of Tourism commercial featuring blind Japanese retiree Masaru Uchimura was based on a real person with a real life story, his wife said Saturday.“The message the ad wants to convey is genuine,” said Uchimura’s Filipino wife Kukai Nye, a native of Bacolod City.Nye said she and her husband, whom she and their friends call “Massy,” are sorry people feel the television commercial was a little too similar to a South African ad two years ago.“[But] it’s based on Massy’s true story,” Nye told the Inquirer from New York in an online Facebook chat.“He traveled to a lot of other places like New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Macau, China, Vietnam and the United States,” she said.” He was also looking for a place to retire and he chose to stay in the Philippines.”“He enjoys his experiences in the Philippines and he recommends our country to his friends,” said Nye, who shared several pictures of her husband.Nye said her husband has not only gone to the Northern Luzon destinations shown in the commercial but also to many other places in the Visayas. She accompanies him on his trips.She said Massy appreciates living in the tropics because “there’s no snow here. In fact, even Baguio is cold for him.”The 37-year-old Nye, a caregiver, met Massy in 2005, when he was a 61-year-old retired civil servant who first visited the Philippines the year before.“At first, he wanted a Chinese caregiver because he also speaks Chinese. But most of his Japanese friends recommended he get a Filipina because ‘they are the best in the world and they take care of you like you’re family,’” Nye said.“He listened to his friends, who have traveled around the world like him and who told him there’s something special about Filipinos [who] have a happy outlook in life,” she added.After hiring Kukai, Massy brought her to Japan but they later returned to the Philippines and lived in Dumaguete City for one year and in Mactan, Cebu for seven years.While in Mactan, Uchimura got a special resident retiree visa (SRRV) issued by the Philippine Retirement Authority and urged his foreigner friends to get their own SRRVs because of its benefits.Uchimura, Nye said, has since grown fond of Filipino food, favoring Bacolod inasal (barbecued chicken), lechon, dinuguan and balot.As shown in the ad, he also favors San Miguel Beer and is a big fan of Bacoleño musician Jose Mari Chan.Uchimura, who is fluent in English, is also very comfortable in the Philippines because people understand him.“Nearly everybody can speak or understand English, so he has no problem interacting with people,” Nye said.And although blind, Nye said Uchimura has said he can sense and hear the joy of the Filipinos around him.“Despite his handicap, he loves traveling around the Philippines, meeting people. He’s glad being given a chance to promote our country whose people he loves very much,” Nye said.Nye said both she and husband thought the commercial was beautiful and regretted the DOT has decided to cancel its P650-million contract with its producer, McCann WorldGroup Philippines.“He and I were very happy with the video. He’s now suddenly famous. The ad is beautiful. It’s a shame it had to be pulled out,” she said.Uchimura, who is turning 73 on June 22, is currently in Tokyo for medical treatment but, Nye said, they hope to be together by October when they will stay for good in their new farm in Talisay, Negros Occidental, near Bacolod City.“We are both eager to return home soon because we miss our dogs,” she said, looking forward to their 10th wedding anniversary on June 27.“Massy is old but young at heart,” Nye said, adding he will surely continue to travel around the Philippines, enjoying his encounters with Filipinos and their culture.",1
"Can the police or the military access your private information, such as your address or mobile number, under the proposed national ID system?Yes, “when the interest of public health or safety requires it” and under three other circumstances.Under House Bill No. 6221, or the “Filipino Identification System Bill,” no person may disclose, collect, publish or use any personal data registered in the database, nor give access to them to third parties, including law enforcement agencies, national security agencies or the Armed Forces.But there are four circumstances when third parties, including the police or the military, may gain access to the private information of Filipino citizens under the proposed new law:When the holder of the ID card expressly authorizes the disclosure of such information to a third person, entity or agencyIn case of accident, disaster or fortuitous events, when information on the medical history of the holder such as the blood type or special medical needs are needed by medical institutions and health service workersWhen the interest of the public health or safety requires soUpon the order of any competent court.The House of Representatives passed the bill on second reading on Wednesday.In a House news release on Saturday, proponents made a renewed push for the priority measure, which was criticized by Makabayan lawmakers for possibly leaving the citizenry’s personal information vulnerable to hacking and other security breaches and profiling private individuals.Former Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr., principal author of the bill, said the Philippines was one of only nine countries in the world without a national identification system.Former President and Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said a unified identification system would enhance the integrity and reliability of government-issued identification cards in private transactions and prevent falsification.Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles, chair of the House appropriations committee, said the Filipino Identification System should “cause all citizens of the Republic to be responsible for their own well-being but accountable for their actions.”Deputy Speaker Ferdinand Hernandez said it would further the government’s effort in combating corruption and minimizing red tape in government and private transactions.The bill will require all adult Filipinos to secure a “Filipino ID card” containing personal information, such as their name, date of birth, blood type, height, weight, and permanent address.Confidential information will also be stored in a corresponding database to be kept by the government, including, among other things, their e-mail address, mobile number, marriage certificate, passport, social security and tax identification numbers, and even their parents’ birth certificate.The ID card, which will contain a smart chip with an individual’s biometric information such as fingerprint and iris scans, shall serve as the official government-issued identification document of a cardholder in dealing with the government.",1

"City Mayor Jefferson Soriano stepped down on Friday, saying he was not going to wait for the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to formally serve the dismissal order issued by the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB).Soriano formally turned over the reins of his office to Vice Mayor Bienvenido de Guzman, who took his oath as the new mayor. Soriano also administered the oath of office to the first-ranked councilor Danilo Baccay as the new vice mayor.The ousted mayor said his lawyers have filed a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals (CA).Earlier, Soriano was ordered dismissed from the service by the Ombudsman, which found him guilty of grave misconduct and abuse of authority in the designation of a transport terminal in this city.Acting on the complaint of Sanny Grace Bangayan, Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales found the retired police official-turned-politician guilty of the administrative offenses of grave misconduct and abuse of authority, perpetually disqualifying him from holding public office and forfeiting his retirement benefits and eligibility.The Ombudsman said the mayor had committed a corrupt act for giving undue advantage to One Way Parking Terminal, Inc. (OWPTI) after he gave the latter a provisional permit to operate the city’s transport terminal.On Dec. 20, 2013, or the very same day he granted the provisional permit to OWPTI, Soriano endorsed to the Sanggunian the application of OWPTI for the operation of the transport terminal.The private firm was allowed to operate the terminal immediately even without seeking a legislative franchise from the Sanggunian, the Ombudsman noted.Soriano “abused his authority and flagrantly disregarded established rule since he put the cart before the horse,” the order read.",1
"THE Senate version of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) aims to expand the government’s free medicines for the poor.Sen. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, chair of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, on Friday said Senate Bill (SB) 1592 also seeks to fund the construction of more public hospitals in remote areas.“Poor Filipinos still face the problem of limited access to low-cost, safe, and quality essential medicines,” said Angara, author and sponsor of SB 1592.“It is our duty to make essential health services available to all Filipinos, giving priority to the needs of underprivileged patients,” the senator said.Congress is set to resume session on November 13 after a month-long break. But the Senate opted to adjust it to November 16 since its legislative work would be affected by the country’s hosting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit from November 13 to 15.Senate Majority Leadet Vicente Sotto 3rd said the upper chamber would tackle TRAIN amendments on November 23 to 24. It intends to pass the proposed tax reform law before the end of the month.Angara noted that the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has 11 partner hospitals that are implementing the Libreng Gamot Para sa Masa Program (Lingap), which entitles poor patients to freemedicine assistance.The free medicine program is now available at the Philippine General Hospital, Jose Reyes Memorial Hospital, East Avenue Medical Center, Lung Center of the Philippines, Philippine Children’s Hospital, and San Lazaro Hospital–all in National Capital Region; Jose B. Lingad Memorial Hospital in San Fernando, Pampanga;Western Visayas Medical Center in Iloilo City, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, SouthernPhilippines Medical Center in Davao City, and Davao Regional Hospital in Tagum City.According to DSWD, approximately 13,000 indigent patients have already benefited from the program.“It is our hope that more poor Filipinos would benefit from free medicines,” Angara said.He cited a World Health Organization study that showed that major causes of deaths in low-income countries can be treated effectively with simple essential medicines.Angara also authored SB 972 mandating all government district hospitals, local health units and barangay (village) health centers in all cities and municipalities to provide free medicine for the poor.",1

Aquilino Pimentel III.Pimentel, who is expected to be the Senate President in the 17th Congress, said he would push for better communication—formally or informally—between the two branches in to legislative matters.Pimentel said there were people who brought up the revision of the Legislative Executive Development Advisory Council (Ledac), which was hardly convened during the Aquino administration.The lack of Ledac meetings has been cited as one of the reasons for President Aquino’s veto of numerous bills.“We can have a formal Ledac or an informal Ledac,” Pimentel said in a phone interview.Although he favors the regular convening of the Ledac, what is more important is the regular communication between lawmakers and the President’s camp on pending bills, he said.“The House Speaker, the Senate President and the President must be in constant touch, and the Senate President must also be in constant touch with the House and with fellow senators,” he said.He would personally see to it that he would know the President’s views on pending bills so as not to waste time and resources, he said.“Even if there’s no formal meeting, if I become Senate President, I will be a frequent visitor to Malacañang,” he said.If the President is not available, he could talk with the executive secretary, the presidential management staff chief or the legal counsel to pass on information about pending bills and to get the Chief Executive’s feedback, he said.This way, any differences or concerns that would have caused the veto of the measure could be resolved, he said.Under the current administration, Pimentel said there had been times when he wondered why certain bills were vetoed when no feedback was given to lawmakers that the President was not inclined to approve them.“Our efforts went to waste. In the case of the SSS (Social Security System) pension increase, the political capital of both camps went to waste,” he said",1
"In his first press conference as senator-elect, boxing champion Manny Pacquiao promised those who voted for him that the bible will be his constitution, and that all his proposals and votes as a legislator will be “by the book.”For starters, Pacquiao said that he is in favor of the death penalty, saying that capital punishment is actually based on the bible.Asked whether or not he believes in the Sixth Commandment, “Thou Shalt Not Kill,” Pacquiao said, “Yes, but I also believe that the government is exempt from that Commandment. And that’s why I favor the death penalty if it is imposed by the government.Pacquiao cited the biblical verse, Romans 13: 1-7, which talks about submission to governing authority.During his campaign, Pacquiao also used his biblical expertise to support his opposition to same-sex marriage, calling gay men and women who engage in same sex worse than animals.”Asked by The Adobo Chronicles if he can promise a 100% attendance as senator, Pacquiao said, “That’s not in the bible.”Pacquiao is the among the top absentees in his current term as a congressman.",0
"Nevermind that Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte appointed her to head a cabinet position as chair of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC).Nevermind that she she traveled to the United States seeking to enlist partners in the private sector to support her advocacies as vice president.Leni Robredo thinks that she has no real powers “except to wait for something to happen to the president.”That wait can be hours, days, weeks, or up to six years.Here is what she said before an audience of Filipino Americans in Philadelphia last week.",0
"Uniformed personnel would have to wait until 2018 before President Duterte’s promise to double their take-home pay could be realized, Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno disclosed on Tuesday.Mr. Duterte overwhelmingly won the votes of policemen and soldiers after he promised to double their basic salaries during the campaign.In all his visits to police and military camps since he took office in July, the President reiterated his vow, telling personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police that they would start receiving higher pay by December 2016.But the Commander in Chief failed to keep his word—just as he came short in fulfilling his promise to rid the country of criminality and illegal drugs within the first six months of his presidency.Speaking at a news briefing in Malacañang, Diokno said increasing the basic pay of soldiers and police personnel by 100 percent was easier said than done as it would affect the monthly pension of retired PNP and AFP officials.He said the proposed tax reforms should be implemented to augment the annual budget for the state security forces.“The way I see it, as far as the military is concerned, we would be able to comply with the desire of the President to double their take-home pay by January of 2018,” Diokno said.“(It could come) sooner if we pass the tax reform because tax reform would mean reducing the personal income tax rate from a maximum of 32 percent to 25 percent,” he explained.For the time being, he said soldiers, policemen and all other government workers would receive the second installment of the salary hike, based on an executive order signed by then President Benigno Aquino III in February last year.In 2016, there were 150,950 PNP personnel and 124,717 members of the AFP, data from the Department of Budget and Management showed.While Aquino’s order could have “a legal defect” since it was not approved by Congress, Diokno said the Duterte administration would honor it as the government had already allocated funds for it this year.He said a legislation was needed to address the expected dramatic increase in monthly pension of retired uniformed personnel as a necessary result of the pay hike.",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte made it clear that he never said he would allow “jueteng” to flourish in the country, and neither did he order the police to stop going after operators of the numbers racket.The President said he wanted to correct “one senator,” apparently referring to Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who warned police officers not to follow “illegal orders,” including stoppingthe campaign against jueteng, from their superiors, even the President.“I didn’t say that I’ll allow jueteng,” the President said in a speech on Monday night in Maasin City, Southern Leyte province. “I only said I will look for ways to handle this because the lotto has not been useful. It was supposed to win over jueteng.”“I never said that I prohibited the police. I never gave any such order. (Lacson) just didn’t listen to the full transcript,” he said.Not valid legal defenseOn Saturday, Lacson, who was chief of the Philippine National Police from 1999 to 2001, reminded officers that following an illegal order was “not a valid legal defense in court.”He was reacting to a statement by the President a week earlier that seemed to suggest that the government should go easy on jueteng until a viable “replacement” was found for the racket.The President said then that the economy was “in the doldrums” and he was considering a strong replacement for jueteng to stir economic activity in the provinces.“Now if I don’t have a replacement for jueteng, what can I do?” he said.“It’s easy, if there’s another form of gambling that takes over. I’ll say, ‘You get out of there’ and arrest them all. Then what is the activity—economic activity? None. Now if there’s jueteng … at least money goes around. Some people will get hungry, others will be able to eat, [but] there’s commercial activity,” he added.‘Jueteng’ and drugsLast week, the President followed this up by expressing concerns that the illegal drug trade might become more rampant if jueteng were totally eradicated because this would allow drug dealers to use jueteng’s “very extensive and intensive network.”He had also said no administration was able to stop drugs and illegal gambling.“I’m not saying I won’t take action. I will. But I am aware of the danger of what will develop after you stop jueteng,” the President said.On Monday night, the President said he still has to look for ways to help stimulate the local economies, reiterating that “if you don’t put a stop to (jueteng) now, the people involved in the drug trade will settle in to take over the networking.”“So just listen to me because you chose me … when we finish this, I promise you a more comfortable Philippines,” he said.Small Town LotteryThe lotto game may not have been successful, as the President said, in curbing the numbers racket, but another game created by the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO)",1
"ANOTHER corruption complaint was filed against Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd before the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC.)It was the second complaint filed against Bello this month.PACC Commissioner Manuelito Luna said the case was filed by Amanda Lalic-Araneta, the president of the MMML Recruitment Services, Inc.Also charged were Jesus Cruz, former officer-in-charge of the International Labor Attache Bureau, and former Labor undersecretary Dominador Say.“[The people involved] allegedly cancelled the license of the recruitment agency [of Araneta] without sufficient grounds and the disposition was delayed, apart from claiming that there was bribery,” Luna said.“Like the first complaint against the secretary, we will assign this to a commissioner for study and fact-finding inquiry,” he added.Luna said Araneta asked to be enrolled in the Witness Protection Program “to protect her and her family from reprisals.”On Wednesday, the PACC took cognizance of the graft complaint filed against Bello and Say by Monalie Dizon, who claimed to be the secretary-general of the Kilusang Pagbabago National Movement for Change.Dizon accused Bello and Say of extorting money from Azizza Salim, who shelled out P6.8 million in exchange for Say’s reversal of the cancellation order issued by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration against Salim’s Azzizah International Manpower Services.Luna on Sunday said the complaint filed by Araneta was strong since she had personal knowledge of the charges against Bello.“This is more serious than the first one. She has personal knowledge because she personally gave the money to Bello amounting to P100,000 and the latest iPhone model as a Christmas gift in December 2016,” Luna told The Manila Tmes.In her complaint, Araneta said she also gave an iPhone to one of Bello’s staff, Lalaine Valencia, and 8 more iPhones to other Labor officials.“She has many more revelations in her affidavit but I cannot disclose them now as we are still validating,” Luna said.Among the items being validated in Araneta’s claim that Cruz asked her to produce P10 million to P15 million “so that LLLM’s license to recruit would not be cancelled, and the pending cases against the agency would not be investigated.”“It was not consummated but the mere suggestion that she was asked to give money, there’s a case against Cruz, not Bello.” Luna added. “So we will conduct fact-finding investigation on this, we will summon several personalities to validate this. We will give serious attention to this.”Bello had denied any wrongdoing and dared his accusers to file a case against him in court.In a statement on Sunday, he vowed to continue providing full protection to workers.“We have taken initiatives to pursue effective implementation of the right to security of tenure and eliminate practices that circumvent the law prohibiting illegal contractual arrangements,” he said.Bello said the Labor department aims to regularize 300,000 employees this year.RALPH EDWIN U.

"THE SUPREME Court on Tuesday formed a fact-finding committee to look into allegations by President Duterte that four incumbent trial court judges had been involved in illegal drug activities and asked Malacañang to file a formal complaint against them.In a resolution, the court en banc appointed retired Associate Justice Roberto A. Abad to lead the panel and to submit a report in 30 days after the filing of the charges and the replies of the accused.“The court today resolved to direct Executive Secretary Salvador C. Medialdea to submit complaint affidavits against the four judges within seven days, furnishing the respondent judges with a copy of the same,” said the resolution, which was read by spokesperson Theodore Te during a news briefing.The high court also directed the judges named―Exequil Dagala of Dapa-Socorro in Surigao province, Adriano Savillo of Iloilo City, Domingo Casiple of Kalibo, Aklan province, and Antonio Reyes of Baguio City―to respond to the allegations within seven days upon receiving the Palace complaint.The court said it would treat as a complaint the remarks made by Mr. Duterte during a televised speech in Davao City early Sunday in which he named the judges among 159 officials, soldiers and policemen he said were involved in illegal drug activities.In a letter to Mr. Duterte on Monday, Sereno reminded the President that the Supreme Court was the only entity empowered to discipline members of the judiciary.She also pointed out that of the seven judges named by the President, one had been dismissed in 2007 for gross ignorance of the law or misconduct (Lorenda Mupas of Dasmariñas, Cavite province). and another (Roberto Natividad of Calbayog, Samar province) was killed on Jan. 14, 2008, at the age of 69. A third judge, Rene Gonzales of Iloilo City, retired last month.During the briefing, Te said the committee would look into administrative liability of the four judges in the performance of their duties.He pointed out that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction over criminal complaints.Te said the court’s inquiry would allow the judges to clear their names as their alleged involvement would have an impact on their duties. He also said dragging judges in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs would expose them to possible danger because of the extrajudicial killings that have accompanied the campaign.Paid media peopleEarlier on Tuesday, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said the Cabinet cluster for security, justice and peace that met on Monday in Malacañang was told that drug lords were funding some members of the media to derail Mr. Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs.Aguirre did not give details in his speech at the 43rd anniversary of the Alpha Kappa Rho fraternity.Reacting to the disclosure, the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines (NUJP) urged Aguirre to provide evidence and name the media groups concerned.“If the evidence warrants, file charges against them,” NUJP president Ryan Rosauro said in a statement.“Without presenting any proof, Secretary Aguirre is not only committing a serious injustice, he is endangering all journalists,” he said.Rosauro said Aguirre’s accusation “is much worse than claiming most of the more than 170 journalists who have been murdered since 1986 deserved their fates because they were corrupt.”“What Mr. Aguirre has done is spread a deadly rumor that could place any and all journalists in the cross-sights of those responsible for the orgy of drug-related extrajudicial killings that continue to flood our streets with blood,” he said.",1
"The House of Representatives is ready to host President Duterte’s State of the Nation Address (Sona) before the joint session of Congress at the Batasang Pambansa complex in Quezon City on Monday.House secretary general Cesar Pareja and sergeant-at-arms Roland Detabali said security forces were ready to protect the President, congressmen and about 3,000 invited guests.“We have held numerous interagency meetings, plannings and rehearsals to ensure the safety of our President, the VIPs, the guests and other personnel, considering all possible scenarios from bombings to fires, chemical attack, etc.,” Detabali said in a press conference on Friday.Final BBL draftPareja said that Mr. Duterte, during the time allotted for his Sona, would sign the final draft of the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), assuming this would be approved by both houses of Congress in the morning.“That was the plan conveyed to us,” Pareja said.Detabali declined to state the exact number of soldiers and policemen to be deployed.Some of the special units that would field personnel include the Joint Special Operations Group, the Philippine Army’s Light Reaction Regiment, the Philippine Navy’s Special Naval Operation Group, and police Special Action Forces.Charter change, federalism and illegal drugs will likely be the main theme of the President’s Sona, according to senators.Nation’s illsSen. Sonny Angara said he expected Mr. Duterte to talk “a bit” about the bills he had signed into law, including free tuition, school feeding, antihazing and free irrigation.Opposition Sen. Francis Pangilinan said he hoped the President would make a clear statement to the people about solutions to the nation’s ills.“We hope he can tell the people how he will solve the problems of rising prices of goods, how people’s earnings will rise, how to give jobs to the people,” Pangilinan said.Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, a fierce critic of Mr. Duterte, expects the President to “rant and lie to the Filipino people like he always does.”",1
"The Sandiganbayan’s Special Third Division stood pat on its ruling that denied former Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile’s plea for dismissal of a plunder case filed against him and several other individuals in connection with the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) or pork b arrel scam.In a resolution promulgated on April 27, the court thumbed down his motion for reconsideration.“In sum, the court finds that accused Enrile has failed to present any sound reason for the court to overturn its resolution promulgated on January 31, 2017,” the Sandiganbayan’s Special Third Division said.Enrile’s camp earlier asked the court to throw out or nullify the Information (charge sheet), arguing that there is no evidence against him and saying the Information failed to charge the offense of plunder.In its January ruling, the court found that “the Information sufficiently alleges the ultimate facts constituting the crime of plunder.”This prompted the defense to file a motion for reconsideration, arguing in part that “the court does not reflect accurately the basis of the accused’s ‘Motion to Quash…’”But in its April ruling, the court found Enrile’s motion for reconsideration “devoid of merit.”It said the January ruling “reflect[s] accurately” his ground in asking for the quashal of the charge sheet, adding that he raised the same argument.The court, in part, added that Enrile “claims that the Information should be quashed on the ground that the facts alleged therein do not constitute the offense of plunder. This issue had been duly considered and thoroughly passed upon by the court” in its earlier ruling.It thus denied “for lack of merit and/or for being pro forma” the motion for reconsideration filed by the defense.Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice Amparo Cabotaje-Tang, who concurrently leads the court’s Third Division, penned the ruling, which was concurred in by Associate Justice Sarah Jane Fernandez and Associate Justice Zaldy Trespeses.Enrile was charged along with his former aide Jessica Lucila “Gigi” Reyes and alleged pork scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles as well as Napoles’ then-employee John Raymund de Asis and her nephew Ronald John Lim.He is one of three former senators namely, Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr. and Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada, who were charged in June 2014 along with Napoles and several other individuals in connection with the PDAF scam.Both Revilla and Estrada are detained at the Philippine National Police Custodial Center in Camp Crame in Quezon City, while Enrile is out on bail after the Supreme Court granted his bail petition on humanitarian grounds.Napoles is serving a life sentence at the Correctional Institute for Women in Mandaluyong City (Metro Manila) after a Makati City (Metro Manila) court found her guilty in a serious illegal detention case filed against her by pork scam witness Benhur Luy.REINA TOLENTINO",1
"For the safety of everyone, city officials are making Good Friday crucifixions in three villages here a strictly Filipino affair—and for true penitents only.Councilor Harvey Quiwa, cochair of the Malelo (Holy Week) 2015 Committee, said on Monday that a ban on the crucifixion of foreigners covered the neighboring villages of San Pedro Cutud, Santa Lucia and San Juan.The crucifixion of foreigners was also prohibited last year, but Danish filmmaker Lasse Spang Olsen managed to join 11 Filipino men who had themselves nailed to crosses in the annual rites for the atonement of sins, seeking favors from God and giving thanks for answered prayers.The village council of San Pedro Cutud allowed Olsen to join the rites after he claimed that he had been converted to Roman Catholicism.Local officials said the ban on foreign participation had been prompted by the disrespect for the local Lenten tradition shown by some foreigners.In 2008, a Briton made a scene before backing out at the last minute, they said.Once, a Japanese man used the footage of his crucifixion as an insert in a pornographic film, they said.",1
"To show solidarity with women on International Women’s Day on Sunday, 15 men from government agencies here walked almost a quarter of a mile “in her shoes.”Perched awkwardly in women’s high-heeled shoes, 15 male employees—five each from the municipal government, the National Police Commission and the Armed Forces in Kalinga—walked 400 meters from Gate 2 of Benguet State University to the town hall here.“Painful feet” was the fundamental lesson of this exercise, said Commissioner Percival Cendaña of the National Youth Commission (NYC), which had staged the event “In Her Shoes” for the second time.Cendaña, who joined the walk in a pair of beige high-heeled shoes, said that men teetering on women’s footwear vicariously experienced how it was “to strike a balance as wife, mother, office worker and family leader.”“In Her Shoes” is an international action to promote women’s rights, the NYC commissioner said. “We want men to reflect for a few moments and walk a mile in the shoes of a woman,” he added.The La Trinidad march was the Benguet leg of a national campaign held simultaneously in Quezon City, Cebu and Davao City.Army Capt. Edelfred Mendoza soldiered on in his pair of high heels, alongside Army Corporals Zaldy Balisi, Crisanto Andres, Joel Macabagbag and Jefferson Bartolome, who came in civilian attire.The soldiers, who are stationed at Camp Henry Allen in Baguio City, are members of the Alpha Mapagmahal Company of the Army’s 5th Division based in Gamu, Isabela province.“We had a difficult time finding women’s shoes that fit us. Our toes kept slipping out of the shoes we had initially bought,” Bartolome said. In the end, he said, they had “to borrow high heels from women advocates who participated in the march.”The short walk was trickier for other men who wore socks, as it forced them to walk with a limp. “My feet kept sliding forward, so my whole weight rested on my toes,” said one march participant.Another described the event as the most painful experience of his life. “Each step I made [caused] pain to shoot up from (my shinbone),” he said.Cendaña said the pain was meant to show men what women have to endure when they “subscribe to men’s agenda of what beauty [should be].”Rosamund Pike, who starred in the movie version of “Gone Girl,” was quoted as saying that she lives “in hope that one day we will view high heels with the same horror with which we view foot-binding.”Women in high-heeled shoes are perceived to look sexier than when they wear flat shoes, a perception supported by a recent study published in the academic journal “Evolution and Human Behavior.”According to the study by several psychologists in the UK, “Wearing high heels makes women look more attractive by making them more feminine, as the effect of heels was to exaggerate some sex-specific elements of female gait including: Greater pelvic rotation, increased vertical motion at the hip, shorter strides and higher number of steps per minute.”Cendaña said men often assume that today’s women live in a better social environment because they are educated and are now better suited for jobs previously associated with men.But women still deal with “deep-seated biases,” the NYC official said, because they are required to take charge of family matters while juggling a career or a business enterprise.Bartolome agreed. “Sometimes, consciously or unconsciously, men forget that women in this age still live difficult lives,” he said.RELATED STORIESMark Women’s Month, LGUs urgedMen, boys walk on heels for Women’s Month",1
"Dear Mr. President,How dengue basically works Persons who get sick with the dengue virus for the first time suffer from mild dengue, which is generally not a serious disease. The problem, however, is when the same person gets sick for the second time, because it’s when severe dengue happens.Severe dengue is a potentially deadly complication due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairmentHence, a person’s first dengue infection is like a “warning”, sort of like a “free pass”, a message saying, “You should be very careful because it’ll be so much worse, if not fatally worse, the next time.”Senator Richard Gordon has warned about this in as early as December 2015 Persons who get sick with the dengue virus for the first time suffer from mild dengue, which is generally not a serious disease. The problem, however, is when the same person gets sick for the second time, because it’s when severe dengue happens.Severe dengue is a potentially deadly complication due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment [1] Hence, a person’s first dengue infection is like a “warning”, sort of like a “free pass”, a message saying, “You should be very careful because it’ll be so much worse, if not fatally worse, the next time.”Senator Richard Gordon has warned about this in as early as December 2015 [2] when he said Sanofi itself admitted risks, but the DoH ignored him.Anti-Dengue Mass Vaccination Program In early April 2016, the DoH launched a massive anti-dengue immunization program covering 1 million 4th grade students in Central Luzon, CALABARZON, and NCRAt the time, both Sanofi and the World Health Organization have warned against vaccinating those with no history of dengueLet me state this more clearly: If a person has never had dengue before and gets bitten by a mosquito for the first time, that person will get mild dengue. However, if that same person who has never had dengue is vaccinated with Dengvaxia AND gets bitten for the first time, he gets severe dengue right away. In short, Dengvaxia dramatically worsens dengue symptoms for those who have never had dengue beforeI feel that Sanofi was a bit sneaky with this warning because they called it a “theoretical risk”, as clinical trials on 2- to 14- y/o kids confirmed that Dengvaxia has the exact same effects on those aged 2 to 9. The trial, however, has very few test subjects aged 9 and up, so Sanofi can’t say yet if Dengvaxia does the same to that age group. In early April 2016, the DoH launched a massive anti-dengue immunization program covering 1 million 4th grade students in Central Luzon, CALABARZON, and NCR [3] . The program used Sanofi’s newly-developed vaccine Dengvaxia which, at the time, was recommended only for individuals have had dengue before and are 9 years or older [4] At the time, both Sanofi and the World Health Organization have warned against vaccinating those with no history of dengue [5] . This warning stems from the vaccine’s tendency to act as the “first infection”, so that the first “real” infection (through a mosquito bite) will mimic the symptoms of a second infection.Let me state this more clearly: If a person has never had dengue before and gets bitten by a mosquito for the first time, that person will get mild dengue. However, if that same person who has never had dengue is vaccinated with Dengvaxia AND gets bitten for the first time, he gets severe dengue right away. In short, Dengvaxia dramatically worsens dengue symptoms for those who have never had dengue before [6] I feel that Sanofi was a bit sneaky with this warning because they called it a “theoretical risk”, as clinical trials on 2- to 14- y/o kids confirmed that Dengvaxia has the exact same effects on those aged 2 to 9. The trial, however, has very few test subjects aged 9 and up, so Sanofi can’t say yet if Dengvaxia does the same to that age group.Sanofi’s material concealment, DoH’s mathematical manipulation However, instead of finding additional suitable test subjects (i.e. aged 9 and up with no dengue history), Sanofi marketed the vaccine right away. After all, Sanofi’s trials basically proved that Dengvaxia is not for 9 and below. If they did another trial for those 9 and above and confirmed the same adverse results, then Dengvaxia would’ve gone straight to the trash bin. That is, the $1.78 billion they’ve invested in the past 20 years would’ve gone to wasteAnd here comes another problem.DoH wanted to inject 1 million kids with Dengvaxia, even if they are not sure who among them have had dengue before (seropositive) or and those who have not (seronegative).According to WHO’s April 2016 paper on Dengvaxia, the vaccine may still be used for mass immunizations if at least 70% of target population is seropositive, and that’s what the DoH used to justify its vaccination programTo do this, they cited a 2016 studyThis is bad math, to say the least, because the test samples (from Cebu) ARE NOT representative of the target population (from Luzon). And despite this glaring flaw, Malacañan, through Spokesperson Roque However, instead of finding additional suitable test subjects (i.e. aged 9 and up with no dengue history), Sanofi marketed the vaccine right away. After all, Sanofi’s trials basically proved that Dengvaxia is not for 9 and below. If they did another trial for those 9 and above and confirmed the same adverse results, then Dengvaxia would’ve gone straight to the trash bin.

The DoH extrapolated Cebu City data to say that 90% of 4th graders in NCR, CALABARZON, and Central Luzon are seropositive, which would supposedly fulfill WHO’s guidelines.This is bad math, to say the least, because the test samples (from Cebu) ARE NOT representative of the target population (from Luzon). And despite this glaring flaw, Malacañan, through Spokesperson Roque [10] and Secretary Duque [11] , still uses this justification.DoH endangered over 830,000 kids DoH was actually unsure about how many and which among the 1 million kids targeted are seronegativeI should also note that the same WHO document advises against mass vaccinating populations where less than 50% are seropositiveDoH Sec. Duque has confirmed that at least 830,000 kidsMr. President, this is a big mess. A big, deadly mess. DoH was actually unsure about how many and which among the 1 million kids targeted are seronegative [12] . As I have said before, Dengvaxia worsens dengue symptoms for seronegative recipients, i.e. children who have not had dengue.I should also note that the same WHO document advises against mass vaccinating populations where less than 50% are seropositive [13] . The problem, however, was that DoH was in a strange rush so they did away with testing children and vaccinated them right away.DoH Sec. Duque has confirmed that at least 830,000 kids [14] have been vaccinated so far. The vaccine, which was for a time also available from local private vendors, was also privately administered to many Filipinos. DoH doesn’t know which ones of those 830,000 kids have never had dengue before. That is, DoH doesn’t know which ones require monitoring and which ones who don’t.Mr. President, this is a big mess. A big, deadly mess.Let’s take care of the 830,000 kids first Before I discuss how the situation has gone this bad, let me first recommend a few preliminary courses of action so that we can minimize the harm caused to the 830,000 kids by this DoH debacle.First, de-escalate through information Simply telling people not to panic will not prevent them from panicking. Instead, you may want to ask for airtime from the major networks so you can address the entire country and explain to them what’s going on and what you are doing or planning to do about it.You can also ask DepEd to to discuss the issue during PTA meetings. You may also order social workers in affected areas to visit the homes.Reach out to Dengvaxia victims to reassure them that the government is doing its best to address the situation. Instruct the social workers to educate the families on ways to mitigate the situation. More than lowering mortality rates, this can help calm down panicky parents who are clueless about what’s going on.Second, create an emergency fund Please set up an emergency fund that hospitals, whether private or public, can tap into anytime. Set it up in such a way that a hospital can withdraw from it to cover the expenses of any patient who reports a fever and fits the profile of those who were under the botched vaccination program, or shows any proof that they have been vaccinated with Dengvaxia.This way, parents of Dengvaxia victims, who are typically not well off, will be less likely to think twice about consulting doctorsThird, restore trust in the public health system Please suspend or terminate all officials who have a lot to do with this mess. This way, we can help quell the public’s doubts on the integrity and general reliability of the public healthcare system.Now, let’s ask: How did it come this far? Please set up an emergency fund that hospitals, whether private or public, can tap into anytime. Set it up in such a way that a hospital can withdraw from it to cover the expenses of any patient who reports a fever and fits the profile of those who were under the botched vaccination program, or shows any proof that they have been vaccinated with Dengvaxia.This way, parents of Dengvaxia victims, who are typically not well off, will be less likely to think twice about consulting doctors [15] , enabling the medical establishment to diagnose dengue cases early, thereby lowering mortality rates.Please suspend or terminate all officials who have a lot to do with this mess. This way, we can help quell the public’s doubts on the integrity and general reliability of the public healthcare system.First, FDA changed rules in 2013 to favor Sanofi One major main point of contention in this vaccine scandal is the uncertainty of Dengvaxia’s effects on seronegative recipients (never had dengue) aged 9 and up. An issue where the WHO said “it is critical to evaluate as soon as possible whether there is any risk to this populationPhase IV drug trials could have addressed this issue. In Phase IV drug trials, a new drug is sold publicly to 3,000 people per year for three years as doctors closely monitor recipients for adverse effectsThat is exactly what Malaysia demanded in April this year before it clears Dengvaxia thereI have reason to believe that Hartigan-Go did this to benefit Sanofi. Before joining government, Hartigan-Go was an Executive Director of Zuellig Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Zuellig Pharma, Sanofi’s official local distributors. After leaving government in June 2016, Hartigan-Go headed AIM’s Zuellig SchoolHe is Zuellig through-and-through. Suffice it to say, the Philippines’ de facto Phase IV Dengvaxia trial was done on 830,000 innocent children. Hartigan-Go, regardless of intent, indeed used 830,000 Filipino kids as laboratory rats. One major main point of contention in this vaccine scandal is the uncertainty of Dengvaxia’s effects on seronegative recipients (never had dengue) aged 9 and up. An issue where the WHO said “it is critical to evaluate as soon as possible whether there is any risk to this population [16] .”Phase IV drug trials could have addressed this issue. In Phase IV drug trials, a new drug is sold publicly to 3,000 people per year for three years as doctors closely monitor recipients for adverse effects [17] That is exactly what Malaysia demanded in April this year before it clears Dengvaxia there [18] , and that is exactly what the Philippine failed to do in as far as Dengvaxia. In 2013, then FDA chief Kenneth Hartigan-Go made Phase IV trials optional when he said manufacturers, by themselves, can decide whether to do Phase IV trials or not [19] . Thus, Sanofi was able to market Dengvaxia right after their Phase III trials ended.I have reason to believe that Hartigan-Go did this to benefit Sanofi. Before joining government, Hartigan-Go was an Executive Director of Zuellig Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Zuellig Pharma, Sanofi’s official local distributors. After leaving government in June 2016, Hartigan-Go headed AIM’s Zuellig School [20] He is Zuellig through-and-through. Suffice it to say, the Philippines’ de facto Phase IV Dengvaxia trial was done on 830,000 innocent children. Hartigan-Go, regardless of intent, indeed used 830,000 Filipino kids as laboratory rats.Second, corruption in procurement The Aquino Government has been in talks with Sanofi in as early as 2014, when PNoy met Sanofi during the Beijing APEC summitLess than a month after the Paris meetings and before 2015 ended, DBM has already released a SARO for P3.5 billion, sourced from the Office of the President’s Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund and transferred to the Philippine Children’s Medical CenterPCMC received P3 billion from these funds and used it to buy Dengvaxia. This amount raises suspicion because Sanofi declared only EUR 20 million (P1 billion) in Dengvaxia sales for Q1 2016Where did the other P2 billion pesos go?What made this whole thing even more irregular is that all these procurement steps were taken before Dengvaxia was discussed by the Formulary Executive Council. All drugs require FEC approval before the government can procure them, and the Aquino Government procured Dengvaxia without one, as the FEC approval (exemption) was issued after the fact. The Aquino Government has been in talks with Sanofi in as early as 2014, when PNoy met Sanofi during the Beijing APEC summit [21] . In May 2015, DOH Sec. Garin clandestinely met Sanofi in France and taught the French executives how to entice our Congress to purchase Dengvaxia [22] . Lastly, in early December 2015, Pnoy, Garin, and other cabinet members met with Sanofi on the days surrounding the Paris Accord meetings [23] Less than a month after the Paris meetings and before 2015 ended, DBM has already released a SARO for P3.5 billion, sourced from the Office of the President’s Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund and transferred to the Philippine Children’s Medical Center [24] . That is, despite the DAP ruling issued earlier in February 2015 [25] , the Aquino Government used a DAP-like mechanism just 10 months later [26] PCMC received P3 billion from these funds and used it to buy Dengvaxia. This amount raises suspicion because Sanofi declared only EUR 20 million (P1 billion) in Dengvaxia sales for Q1 2016 [27] Where did the other P2 billion pesos go?What made this whole thing even more irregular is that all these procurement steps were taken before Dengvaxia was discussed by the Formulary Executive Council. All drugs require FEC approval before the government can procure them, and the Aquino Government procured Dengvaxia without one, as the FEC approval (exemption) was issued after the fact.Third, coverup within DOH Evidence suggests that DoH rank and file may be trying to cover up the Dengvaxia messI stumbled upon the case of a 12-year-old child in Capas, Tarlac, who contracted severe dengue just three months after receiving the third and final dose of DengvaxiaI spoke to the mother over the phone and she told me that she did not sign any consent form, that she found out about her daughters vaccination only after the fact.The child’s family is very poor. The mother even had to borrow money just to get the child admitted to a hospital in Tarlac City. She was openly soliciting for financial through social media and I told her that I will visit her the next day to speak to her, to hand her a few thousand pesos from my own pocket, and to ask her to ask her to fill out several forms so I can help her get more substantial financial help from charitable GOCCs and public officials.Upon arriving at the hospital, however, I discovered that DOH-Tarlac has whisked her away to Pampanga two hours prior. I would’ve given DOH the benefit of the doubt, if not for the fact that the hospital staff told me that DOH paid for her outstanding balance. The hospital is privately-owned the child has been in ICU for a couple of days or so. I doubt that DOH has discretionary funds that it can use to bail out patients just like that.I smell a cover up. If the DOH bailed out that 12-year-old, then why didn’t it bail out the 12-year-old’s neighbors, who were also stricken with dengue and admitted in the same hospital?With that said, I have serious doubts about the accuracy of reports that Secretary Duque has been receiving.

Prior to Sanofi’s November admissionHowever, according to some of the resource persons invited in the first hearing, several congressmen, including then party-list Representative Harry Roque, attempted to prevent anti-Dengvaxia resource persons to testify.On the first day, Roque told Philhealth director Dr. Tony Leachon, a resource person, that the latter cannot be allowed to testify because of the lack of approval from the Philippine College of Physicians, of which Leachon was president. This defies logic because Leachon is an expert on the issue with or without PCP approval.According to Leachon, Roque and the other congressmen stayed mum as former Health Sec. Janette Garin, who was just an audience member during the hearing, kept on standing up and intimidating the witness. Leachon said Garin went hysterical so the presiding officer was forced to adjourn the first hearing only an hour after it started, no complaints or admonitions against Garin came from Roque.A few hours prior to the second hearing, Roque approached Leachon and asked him to state his credentials as Roque had it videotaped. When the hearing started, Roque played a spliced version of the footage and made it appear that Leachon, a very accomplished physician, was overconfident. That is, Roque character-assassinated Leachon even before Leachon was able to speak in front of the committee.Please call Dr. Tony Leachon to confirm these allegations.I would not have made a big deal out of this if not for the fact that Roque actively defended Sanofi when the Dengue Vaccine Scandal erupted a couple of weeks ago. As a presidential spokesperson, he should have exercised restraint and put into mind that he speaks on the president’s behalf. Surely, the president that I supported from Day One would have better things to say than “Don’t panic.”It’s also weird that Secretary Duque flip-flopped on his pronouncements and I suspect Roque has a hand in it.About a week ago, Duque said Aquino should attend the Senate probe on DengvaxiaMy sources said Roque pressured Duque in the same way Roque pressured then Health Sec. Paulyn Ubial during her confirmation hearings. Roque was instrumental in blocking Ubial’s confirmation, mainly because of Ubial’s opposition to the defective Dengvaxia vaccine. Duque, Ubial’s replacement, is also up for confirmation, so my sources said Roque told Duque that the latter will suffer the same fate if the latter doesn’t co-operate.I have reason to believe that the Office of the President has two primary sources for this Dengvaxia mess: Health Secretary Duque, who is under intense pressure to get confirmed; and Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, who still wields influence in the Lower House and who has historically antagonized those who oppose Dengvaxia.Mr. President, you said before that you will axe anyone in your cabinet who demonstrates even a whiff of corruption.Mr. President, behold Harry Roque. He may not be addicted to money, but he's addicted to power.And I believe that that kind of addiction, Mr. President, is a problem worse than drugs.

[ ThinkingPinoyI did some arm twisting so I can be seated next to you during the bloggers’ Christmas Party held yesterday in Malacañang. I felt the need to do so because I wanted to be sure that you are already aware of the #DengGate scandal, where over 800,000 kids have been injected with a defective vaccine, thanks to corrupt officials in the government and a greedy pharmaceutical company.You instructed me to write a memo about it and give it to Sec. Bong Go, so here it is. You said I don't have to sign it, but I decided to publish it on my blog too. I stand by what I write, pero salamat pa rin po sa pag-unawa.I have spoken with dengue experts, government officials, and victims’ families to learn more about what happened. Adding the results of extensive research about this particular issue, here’s a relatively short brief of the nightmare that’s haunting almost a million children and their families today. This is by no means an exhaustive discussion of the problem. Please consult experts on the issue, experts from both sides, so that you can get a better picture of what has happened.With that said, let's start with the basics.",0
"For the first time in two decades, Mayor Rodrigo “Digong” Duterte appeared before city employees in Monday’s flag-raising ceremony and spoke for nearly an hour about his oft-repeated campaign against drugs, crime and corruption when he assumes the presidency in two days.Duterte defended his imminent war on crime, hitting out at “stupid” human rights campaigners, and emphasized that the death penalty was for retribution.“These human rights (groups), congressmen, how stupid you are,” he said, as he highlighted their criticism of his plans to impose late-night curfews on children being out in the streets and to reintroduce the death penalty.“I believe in retribution. Why? You should pay. When you kill someone, rape, you should die,” he said.Duterte, 71, won last month’s presidential election after campaigning largely on a platform of ending rampant crime, warning that the Philippines was in danger of becoming a narco-state.He promised that tens of thousands of people would die, with security forces being given shoot-to-kill orders.Since winning, Duterte has also promised to give bounties to police for killing drug dealers. He also encouraged ordinary citizens to kill or arrest suspects.Duterte has been accused of links to vigilante death squads during his nearly two decades as mayor of Davao, which rights groups say have killed more than 1,000 people.Extrajudicial killingsLocal and foreign human rights groups have expressed deep concern about his plans as President, fearing an explosion of extrajudicial killings similar to those seen in Davao.The United Nations’ human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, this month urged Duterte not to reintroduce the death penalty, while criticizing other elements of the planned war on crime.“The offer of bounties and other rewards for murder by vigilantes, and his encouragement of extrajudicial killings by security forces, are massive and damaging steps backwards which could lead to widespread violence and chaos,” Zeid said.With just three days to go before assuming the presidency, Duterte stood firm.“When they describe or characterize a human rights violator, these fools make it appear that the people you kill are saints, as if they are pitiful or innocent,” he said.Duterte said European ambassadors were also among those who had expressed concern over the death penalty and extrajudicial killings.The Philippines abolished the death penalty in 2006 following fierce opposition from the Catholic Church, the religion of 80 percent of Filipinos.Duterte previously said he preferred death by hanging to a firing squad because he did not want to waste bullets, and because he believed snapping the spine with a noose was more humane.Working hoursCity employees, who asked not to be named, said the last time Duterte attended the flag-raising ceremony was in the mid-1990s. The mayor is known to report for work at 3 p.m. and end his day at 3 a.m.The crowd, numbering more than 700, stood between Quezon Park, which was cordoned off by policemen, and City Hall. It was the first time many showed up for the heavily secured event but they were prohibited from getting too near to the mayor, one employee said.“You cannot go near me because they (Presidential Security Group members) will stop you. They believe you will kill me,” he said, soliciting laughter from the crowd. “I also cannot go near you because they will stop me.”Duterte said he was always arguing with his security men. “They tell me where to go. We keep on arguing,” he said, but he acknowledged that they were only doing their job.“They told me that if I get killed during their watch, they will be held responsible,” he said.Duterte spoke for about 50 minutes, reiterating his policies on corruption and illegal drugs.Curfew for minorsHe said he would implement nationwide the 10 p.m. curfew on minors in the city.Minors who are not accompanied by an adult on the streets will not be arrested, he said, but their parents will be held for abandonment.The mayor said he was still “thinking” on whether to implement nationwide the 2 a.m. liquor ban.Duterte said he would not use the vehicles that past Presidents used. “I will not ride on the Mercedes Benz,” he said. “All those who rode that were either impeached or imprisoned.”And just like in his recent public announcements, Duterte stressed his administration’s campaign against drugs and corruption.“There will be no corruption,” he said, adding that if he learned that someone from his administration is involved in corruption, “I will just whisper to you to go.”“It has to stop. I am hell-bent in stopping corruption,” Duterte said. “Please remember that you will never get any help from me if you have corruption cases.” ",1
"Groups concerned about the environmental and climate change joined religious organizations last Monday in opposing the proposed construction of a ww65-billion coal-fired power plant in Barangay Carisquis, Luna, this province.The Philippine Movement for Climate Justice (PMCJ), HELPS for Humanity (H4H), Kanlungan Center Foundation, the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, the Catholic Church, and several private groups formed the Koalisyon Isalbar ti Pintas ti La Union (Coalition to Save the Beauty of La Union).Crisanto Palabay, H4H executive director, said that they formed the coalition for them to have a stronger voice and organization in blocking the 670-megawatt power plant of the Global Luzon Energy Development Corp., the project proponent. The proponent’s mother company is the Global Business Power Corporation, a subsidiary of GT Holdings.“We formed this coalition so that there will be an organization in the local level to help our groups in the national level pushing for our move against this project. We believe that the project in Luna is dangerous to our health and environment,” Palabay said.Valentino de Guzman, PMCJ-Luzon coordinator, said they oppose the project because of the alleged ill-effects of burning coal to human health.“We are pushing (to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources) for the moratorium on all new coal-fired power plants which covers the Luna project. No permit and no application should be signed or approved. All should be status quo because we have not yet resolved the issues on the bad effects of all those operating coal plants. Let us sit down and discuss everything first,” De Guzman said.De Guzman said they will be seeking a meeting with Environment Secretary Gina Lopez to discuss the Luna project situated at a 40-hectare idle land in the coastal barangay of Carisquis and its stoppage.",1
"THE WORLD’S foremost advocate for climate action and the country’s top environmental legislator on Monday called for a greater switch to renewable energy in the Philippines and around the world, citing a global trend to abandon fossil fuels for solar, wind and other zero-carbon energy sources.Former US Vice President Al Gore, chair of the Climate Reality Project, and Sen. Loren Legarda pointed out the seeming paradox in the Philippines’ stance on climate change Monday at the opening day of the Manila leg of Gore’s international climate action training.For while the Philippines helped in reaching global consensus to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius at the historic Paris climate talks last December, it is forging ahead with the construction of 25 coal-fired power plants in the country in the next decade.“Philippine consumption of coal has been on the upswing, which increased by 27 percent between 2012 and 2014. If global projections point to a decline in the share of coal in power generation, why is the Philippines taking the opposite track?” Legarda said in her speech.25 coal plantsShe said government’s solution to the Philippines’ projected need for 13,167 megawatts of power by 2030 was to resort to the “easy and affordable” yet pollutive solution of putting up more coal-fed power plants, contrary to the global direction it advocated in Paris.The 25 planned facilities have been granted environmental compliance certificates and “are now either operational or under construction,” Legarda said.What the “easy and affordable” explanation fails to consider is the fact that there are external costs to coal, which, if considered, would render the coal-fired power plant as one of the most expensive forms of power generation.“Coal-fired power plants’ impacts on health, air quality, climate and life—above anything else—are more vital considerations,” said Legarda, who helped organize Gore’s three-day visit to Manila.She vowed to spend her remaining three years in the Senate to work toward a ban on coal-fired power plants.“We will push for the progressive reduction of least-efficient coal-fired power plants and will work toward banning their construction,” said Legarda, the Global Champion for Resilience of the United Nations’ International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR).Gore hopes the Manila climate training could bring attention to the irony, saying in his two-hour presentation: “The Philippines is now about to build more coal plants. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe we can have an impact on that.”PH laggingHe presented slides that showed how the Philippines was lagging in the shift to renewable energy, even as developing countries like Pakistan, Chile and Bangladesh have increased use of renewable sources, primarily solar power.The United States, one of the world’s biggest energy consumers, is abandoning coal-fed power plants. Currently, coal-sourced power accounts for 0.01 percent of the national total, while the highest are wind and solar energy, each accounting for a third of the supply.“All the proposed [coal-fired power] plants have been defeated by public opposition. These are all plants where retirement has been announced,” Gore said.In the Philippines, coal accounted for 29 percent of electricity production in 2014, while oil was the source of 23 percent of power. Hydroelectric power is at 18 percent, natural gas at 14 percent, geothermal at 10 percent, and waste at 4 percent.Accounting for only 2 percent of electricity production are solar, wind and biomass altogether amid the global decline in fossil fuel use and the “exponential growth” of renewable energy use.Gore said the sun produced “enough energy every single hour to provide the entire world’s full energy use for a year.”",1
"Ban Ki Moon has blasted some world leaders in his farewell address (yes, he is leaving the UN), and we can consider it a small triumph (and mercy) that despite President Duterte's fuck yous, Ban Ki Moon didn't consider him a real danger to the world. This is because unlike many, Ban Ki Moon knows what true evil is.“In too many places, we see leaders rewriting constitutions, manipulating elections, and taking other desperate steps to cling to power,” he said. “My message to all is clear: serve your people. Do not subvert democracy; do not pilfer your country’s resources; do not imprison and torture your critics."" (Duterte did not manipulate elections, has not made desperate attempts to cling to power, did not subvert democracy,. did not pilfer our resources, and did not torture and imprison his critics. BUT WE KNOW WHO DID. BWAHAHA.We know who manipulated elections, is still trying hard to cling to power, imprisoned his enemies illegally, and pilfered our resources.Israel's UN ambassador delivered a major clapback. He didn't say FUCK YOU like Duterte. He just said, like the diplomat that he is, ""The real madness belongs to the UN... It needs to stop obsessing about Israel.""Ban Ki Moon also apologized for the UN's many shortcomings, including UN peacekeepers' exploitation of women and children in Central Africa, and the abandoning of responsibility in Haiti.. Remove his fuck yous and that guy is just telling the damn truth. Hypocrisy and sustaining self-interests, and the interference of world powers, have hindered the UN from fulfilling its original mandate. Ban Ki Moon is a good guy and recognizes these, at least.------------------------Krizette Laureta Chu as posted on Facebook",0

"Another mayor was killed in an ambush in Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija province, on Tuesday afternoon, a day after Mayor Antonio Halili was fatally shot by a sniper outside the Tanauan City Hall in Batangas province.Mayor Ferdinand Bote, 57, of General Tinio town in Nueva Ecija, died from at least five bullet wounds at MV Gallego Hospital just across from the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) compound in Cabanatuan.Bote had just left the Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation System office at the NIA compound in Cabanatuan around 4:30 p.m. when two men on a motorcycle drove up near his sport utility vehicle and opened fire.Malacañang vowed full government effort to solve the killing and bring the perpetrators to justice.“We assure everyone that we would discharge the state obligation for every murder. We will spare no effort in getting to the bottom of this latest violent crime,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said.Mayors’ fearsMonday’s killing in broad daylight of Mayor Halili has sent chills down the spine of some local executives in southern Luzon who have also figured on the Philippine National Police’s “narcolist.”“You cannot take that (worrying) away from us. We, the mayors, are of the same level and I guess it’s just but natural for us to worry [for our security],” Mayor Raul Palino of Teresa, Rizal province, told the Inquirer by phone.Apart from his safety, Palino has to worry about government intelligence agents going around Teresa to inquire about his alleged illegal activities, including being a drug trade protector, though no case has been filed against him.The wife of Mayor Bruno Ramos of Bay, Laguna province, also expressed apprehension over her husband’s safety after Halili was shot, possibly by a sniper, in front of shocked employees during a flag-raising ceremony outside City Hall.“I’ve been telling [him] not to stay late outside and if possible, just bring home his work, like documents he needs to sign,” Julieta Ramos said.UnperturbedMayor Cecilio Hernandez of Rodriguez, Rizal, however, is unperturbed.“Why should I be scared when I know I’m not doing anything wrong?” he said.In October 2017, the National Police Commission (Napolcom) tagged Halili, Palino and Hernandez, as well as Mayors Eulalio Alilio of Lemery, Batangas, and Loreto Amante of San Pablo City, Laguna, as “narcopoliticians.”It later added Mayors Ramos, Roderick Alcala of Lucena City, Quezon province; Juan Toreja of Ibaan, Batangas; and Caesar Perez of Los Baños, Laguna, to the list.The officials have denied any role in the drug trade, but the Napolcom stripped them of their power and control over their local police force.Napolcom reviewHalili was the fourth mayor to be killed in Mr. Duterte’s bloody drug war after Samsudin Dimaukom of Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao province; Rolando Espinosa of Albuera, Leyte province; and Reynaldo Parojinog Sr. of Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental province.Napolcom was reviewing Halili’s petition to clear his name of allegations he was a drug protector at the time of the killing. The petition was submitted to the Office of the President through the Napolcom central office.“And then this attack happened,” Ronald Banzuela, Napolcom head in Batangas, said by phone.Halili, 72, was upbeat two weeks ago that the Napolcom would reinstate his supervisory powers over the police, Tanauan information officer Gerard Laresma said.As they coped with the killing, Halili’s family bristled at President Duterte’s statement that the murder might be connected to the illegal drug trade in the city south of Manila.“My father would rather die than be a drug lord,” the late mayor’s daughter, Angeline, told reporters.But Roque said Mr. Duterte only raised a suspicion that the attack on the mayor was related to the city executive’s alleged involvement in drugs.“And the government has promised to conduct a wide investigation to find out who was really behind the killing of Mayor Halili,” he said.3 ‘persons of interest’Police were eyeing at least three “persons of interest” in the attack.Two of them had to do with the issue of drugs, said Supt. Chitadel Gaoiran, spokesperson for the regional police.“Drug-related could either mean people that must have been angered by his (Halili’s) shame campaign or his (Halili’s) alleged illegal drugs involvement,” Gaoiran said.Investigators earlier indicated that Halili’s controversial order for alleged drug peddlers and petty criminals to be paraded on the streets of Tanauan was being looked at as one of the possible motives.Autopsy results showed that a 5.56 mm bullet was used in shooting Halili. This type of ammunition is used on the M-16 rifle, police said.",1
"SEN. LEILA de Lima on Tuesday denied any relationship with a wanted drug suspect, Kerwin Espinosa, saying a photograph taken with him and a woman was just one of those many photo opportunities during the election campaign.“I don’t remember this honestly,” De Lima told reporters.“I don’t know Espinosa, even the father,” she said, referring to Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. of Albuera, Leyte province.The elder Espinosa had earlier surrendered to police after he and his son were identified as drug pushers in Leyte. He was later able to go back to public office. His son, meanwhile, remains at large.“They are good at digging up dirt,” an incredulous De Lima said when shown the photo.“They were just among those who asked to take a photo with me. That’s not something like an arranged meeting or what. That was just a chance meeting, if that was in Baguio,” the senator said.She said one of the women in the background of the photo was a member of her staff.“I think we were just going around and they approached me. I don’t know him. I don’t remember this. I’m sure of that,” she said.De Lima has been accused by President Duterte of receiving drug money from convicted narcotics traders who had allegedly turned the New Bilibid Prison as the nerve center of their illegal activities outside. She has denied the charges.In Albuera on Tuesday, Mayor Espinosa called a news conference at the local police station and reiterated that he feared for his life after he executed last week a seven-page affidavit naming “powerful” individuals allegedly involved in his son’s illegal drug operation.The mayor, who has been staying at the police station, said some of his son’s protectors were top police officials, congressmen and a senator, among others.He added that he did not want to publicly name these officials pending his request to be placed under the government’s Witness Protection Program.The affidavit was a condition set by the police in exchange for protection after the mayor complained that he had been receiving death threats made through calls from unidentified individuals in his cellular phone.Chief Insp. Jovie Espenido, Albuera police chief, told theInquirer that the affidavit would be used as basis in filing a complaint against the officials and media personalities identified by the mayor.Patrick Ceniza, spokesperson of the mayor, said the elder Espinosa had a reason to be scared because he was not linking ordinary individuals in the illegal drug trade.He cited the female senator in the photo with Kerwin and a woman that was taken in Baguio City in March.“It’s up to you to answer that question,” he replied when asked if De Lima was involved.Espenido said all those named in the affidavit would be formally charged at the Leyte provincial prosecutor’s office today.A teary-eyed Espinosa reiterated his appeal to his son to surrender.He said he was grateful for Espenido for granting his request to place him under his custody.He also expressed his gratitude to President Duterte and PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa for extending assistance to him.Mayor Espinosa also called on his son’s partners, whom he identified as Galo Bobares, Max Miro, Tonypet Zaldivar and Ferdinand Rondina, to surrender.

"The camp of Vice President Jejomar Binay on Friday denied the claim of the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee that he did not answer allegations of overpricing in the construction of Makati City Hall Building II.Lawyer Rico Quicho, spokesperson for Binay, reminded the senators that Binay submitted a notarized affidavit on Nov. 6, 2014, “debunking and answering point [by] point” the accusations against him and members of his family.Quicho was commenting on reports that the blue ribbon subcommittee, in a partial report on its investigation of corruption allegations against Binay, said the Vice President did not take advantage of the offer to him to defend himself at the hearings.“It is a validation of our position that the Senate has, from the very start, already prejudged the issue. They have made up their minds even before the hearing started and will not listen, tolerate, or entertain statements and facts contradicting them,” Quicho said in a statement.Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III, Senate blue ribbon subcommittee chair, acknowledged that Binay submitted an affidavit to the inquiry, which he said was considered in the preparation of the panel’s partial report.READ: Binay camp: Anticlimactic after 21 one-sided hearings“It was not enough to sway the arguments, the ideas, the points. It was not enough to sway the conclusion,” Pimentel said.He said the subcommittee received so many records and testimonies that not all could be mentioned in the report. But this does not mean, he said, that they were not considered.While Binay submitted a statement, Pimentel said, he did not back it up with testimony before the subcommittee.Had Binay done so, there would have been a greater chance of him being quoted in the report, Pimentel said.“The question is, would it change the conclusion?” Pimentel said.He said Binay’s affidavit was more like a legal memorandum, full of legal arguments.The points raised were covered and considered, he said, but the other side had stronger points.“Unfortunately for him, [it was] not enough to persuade and change minds because the other side of the argument or issue had more credible, substantive, and logical evidence and arguments,” Pimentel said.The Senate blue ribbon subcommittee recommended the filing of plunder and graft charges against Binay, his son, Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin “Junjun” Binay, Makati City Hall officials, resident auditors, contractors and his longtime aides Gerardo “Gerry” Limlingan and Eduviges “Ebeng” Baloloy.Former Makati Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado alleged at the hearings that Makati City Hall Building II was overpriced at P2.3 billion.In his eight-page affidavit, the Vice President said “there was no overprice of the Makati City Hall Building II nor any irregularity committed.”Binay said: “Constructing the Makati City Hall Building II into five phases or splitting the contracts, with the conduct of bidding for each phase, is not prohibited by the Procurement Act (Republic Act No. 9184). Section 65.1(d), Rule 21 of the IRR (Implementing Rules and Regulations) of RA 9184 provides that splitting of contracts is prohibited only if the purpose is to avoid bidding, circumvent rules on alternative procurement, or circumvent limits of approving authorities.”Annex “C” of the RA 9184 IRR allows for a minimum of 28 calendar days and a maximum of 144 days for the conduct of the entire procurement process for projects costing more than P50 million. “Thus, the claim of the Commission on Audit (COA) Chair Grace Pulido-Tan that the process should take six months is not correct.”“[B]ased on the records, the procurement or bidding process for each phase of the Makati City Hall Building II project was conducted within the allowable periods of the law.”“The awarding of contracts to a lone bidder after the conduct of biddings is not prohibited by the Procurement Act.”“In Phase 1 of the Makati City Hall Building II project, the winning bidder bested (two) other bidders. For Phases 2 to 5, the lone bidder was the same contractor. Based on the records, there was no reason to disqualify the contractor.”The subcommittee report said Hilmarc’s Construction Inc. was a “favored contractor” that had bagged several multimillion-peso contracts from Makati City Hall.On the alleged overpricing of the building, Binay said:National Statistics Office (NSO) data cannot prove that the building is overpriced because “there are different scopes of work, specifications, design and bills of material.”“NSO data cannot prove that the Makati City Hall Building II is overpriced. The NSO data has inherent limitations. The NSO based its computations on approved building applications and documentary requirements and not on actual construction cost.“The market value appraisals cannot likewise prove that the Makati City Hall Building II is overpriced. As admitted by Mr. Federico Cuervo, the resource person of the Senate, his testimony was only hypothetical costing.”The Davis Langdon & Seah Handbook cannot prove that the building is overpriced because the handbook “expressly states that its data is subject to limitations.”Mere ocular inspection of the building, even by experts, cannot prove overpricing. “As held by the Supreme Court in the case of Ariola v. Commission on Audit, there must be an actual canvass or price quotations on the subject materials from accredited suppliers to prove there was an overprice.”Rights violatedBinay also said that his constitutional rights “were and continue to be violated,” including his constitutional right not to be subjected to a congressional inquiry if the rules of the Senate are not complied with, the right to due process of law, and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.“The hearing has veered toward false criminal accusations against me. It must be emphasized, the Senate shall constitute as the impeachment court in case the House of Representatives initiates impeachment proceedings. Therefore, the senators are unmindful of their role as potential senators-judges. Worst, these senators are acting as prosecutors, judges and even as witnesses,” he said.“As declared by Sen. [Antonio] Trillanes IV, among other things, his objective is to put me in jail,” Binay said.Trillanes said on multiple occasions that he would not stop until Binay was jailed for his alleged crimes.",1
"Narrating a story is not stating a problem. It may be admitting that there is a problem, and I think that is precisely what he did — admitting to the whole world in so many words that his administration is in a terrible shape. But, WHAT is the problem? (And, we should not even question for a moment whether his narrative is a lie or a truth. It is inconceivable that he would tell a lie in front of an august body — that should already be a given and one that does not even warrant a thought.) So, let us just unpack briefly what he said.[President Noynoy Aquino] talked about the Marcos era for two reasons: (1) to remind everybody that his parents were the freedom fighters to whom we owe our democracy (okay, we can give that to him; nobody is complaining), (2) to have a premise that the Church helped his parents in their struggle (still okay, I too can not object to that) From his premise re the Church during Marcos, he complained that the Church changed and just stood by while Gloria plundered the nation. Boom, sumabog na. As Ilda writes above, how can he complain about the Church when he too remained quiet during most of the term of Gloria, even supporting her a couple of times. If I recall correctly the falling out between the Arroyos and the Aquinos only happened towards the middle of Gloria's 2nd term. There was a public clamor for Cory to go against Gloria because of the Garci Tapes. But, Cory hesitated because she was actually instrumental in the installation of Gloria via EDSA2. So when Cory finally acted and walked to Assumption College to organize EDSA3, there was no support. But, that got the ire of Gloria, and she started persecuting them quite subtly, but P-Noy took this personally — the reason he is persecuting her now not subtly. At this stage, has P-Noy stated a problem relevant to the present? Or, was he just talking history that has no longer any relevance?He proceeded to claim that while the Church remained quiet in the face of Gloria's plundering activities, a good many local clerics began and kept on criticizing him during his own incumbency. (He could not understand why they would do that when he is the best that has ever happened to the republic. No, he didn't say that, but what else was he implying?) So, has he stated a problem finally? ….Or, was he just whinning in the middle of a hallowed hall? — now made unhallowed by the tears of a narcissist. Or, was he just hoping that P-Francis would give some of local clerics a good dressing down? If that is true, did he expose his vindictivenes, a veiled rhreat in effect to his perceived enemies?He ended with kind words for P-Francis and Tagle. Now, can we take his nice words for the Church hierarchy as genuine good words, or just platitudes in the face of what I just described above? Be that as it may, did he miss a golden opportunity to play a statesman in a world stage? It would have been a fantastic way to recover from the blunders he had during Yolanda which was beamed to all in earth? Or, did he create more problems by blurring the lines in the separation of Church and State? In the case of the RH law, for example, this was tested to the limit. The Church maintained that it was the State crossing the line for the issue involved morality which is very much of the Church domain. The State maintained that it was not a Church domain for 20% of the population are non-Catholics. Could the speech been more meaningful if he touched on this subject so that in the event other hot button issues like Divorce and Same-Sex Marriages start shaping up in Congress, the debates could be more intellectual, rather than just being acrimonious as it was with RH?Nobody is holding back PNoy to talk about any topic. All Pinoys ask is that it be meaningful. Maybe, separation of Church and State would have been a heavy topic for that venue. But, he could have stuck with the theme for which P-Francis came: the Poor. This would have been an easy topic for the interests of both Church and State are joint in this regard. This has to be a priority of government for no economy can talk of sustainable growth unless it can expand its middle class, and where would you get that, but in giving underpriviledge class a good fighting chance to up their status. On the other hand, in the case of the Church, they can not talk of the soul if the body is not healthy and the stomach is empty — there is simpky no way you can talk of spirituality if the faithful has no choice but to worry about things basic to the physical body. How could such a faithful even comprehend things abstract, things spiritual, when even things material are incomprehensible? …More to it, there is today so much debate going on whether liberal democracy is exacerbating inequality since the ""trickle down"" is simply not working at all, whether it is the developed economies or the 3rd Workd. P-Francis has joined this debate via his last encyclical, and it would have been nice to have had a president talking about this, or is P-Noy simply oblivious to these things? Maybe these things just go over his head, and he just broadcasted via his speech he hates being called 'Kalbo' What a profound way to state a problem, I tell you, and it never ceases to amaze.Basing it from the pronouncements of P-Francis and the several press conferences with Tagle and Lombardi, the Vatican Press Officer, the nation is being urged to elevate the quality of public discourse, and they are insisting these things are urgent. Every time we talk about petty things,… the leaders, the intelligensia crowd, the academics, etc make the poor poorer since the lower class is dependent on the more priviledged ones to be those that initiate a change in mindsets. How can we change them if we cannot ourselves change. It is heart-warming that some in the media are responding in kind for if there was anybody to whom the words of P-Francis applied in between the lines, it is them, and some acknowledge this. Let us hope media could carry this long after the Visit.Diplomatically, Francis and Tagle had to ignore PNoy's speech. It must have been a surprise to these two Jesuit trained guys that another Jesuit trained fellow was a ""point-misser"" if the two had to be blunt, they would still be forced to ignore the speech for it did not add anything to the overarching theme, or any other theme for that matter, that could advance the nation, state-wise, or spiritual-wise.-------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"Fearing a repeat of his escape to Thailand, the Ombudsman has asked the Sandiganbayan to cancel the bail of former Palawan Gov. Joel T. Reyes and order his rearrest despite his appeal of his graft conviction.In an urgent motion, antigraft prosecutors stressed the need to “prevent [the] recurrence” of Reyes’ previous escape when he was still accused of masterminding the murder of broadcaster Gerry Ortega.But Reyes’ lawyer, Demetrio Custodio Jr., said it would be absurd to think that Reyes would be a flight risk at this time, considering that he just scored a legal victory at the Court of Appeals (CA) in connection with the murder case.“Why would he mitigate the value of this victory by fleeing?” Custodio said.For Malacañang, however, the Office of the Ombudsman’s move to seek the detention of Reyes while he appealed his conviction for graft was commendable.“That’s how it should be! I commend the [Ombudsman] for the order!” said presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.The Court of Appeals recently dismissed the murder case, but Roque, who had been the counsel for the Ortega family, slammed the ruling.Roque said on Monday that Malacañang would seek the reversal of the appeals court’s order.Solicitor General Jose Calida also assailed the appeals court’s Jan. 4 ruling, saying he was ready to seek a reversal of the decision in the Supreme Court.Mining permitOn Aug. 29 last year, the Sandiganbayan’s Third Division meted out a prison term of six to eight years to Reyes in connection with the irregular renewal of the mining permit of a company that exceeded ore extraction limits.Over the Ombudsman’s objections, however, the antigraft court still allowed Reyes to post P60,000 bail—double the bond required when the trial was still pending—while it was resolving his appeal.At the time of Reyes’ conviction for graft, his murder case was still pending. Since he was still detained in Palawan’s capital, Puerto Princesa City, at the time, the Sandiganbayan found no reason to deny him bail.Despite the Court of Appeals’ decision to set aside the Palawan Regional Trial Court’s finding of probable cause in the Ortega murder case, Reyes managed to walk free that day, thanks to the bail he had long posted on his corruption cases pending in the Sandiganbayan.Because Reyes is no longer detained, prosecutors in the mining permits case asked the court to reconsider its grant of bail because “the circumstances … had changed.”Stop recurrence of escapeProsecutors reminded the court that “accused Reyes was a fugitive,” having fled the country with his brother, former Mayor Mario Reyes of Coron town in Palawan, in March 2012 following their indictment for Ortega’s murder in January 2011.During their escape, the brothers reportedly led a lavish lifestyle in Phuket, Thailand, before they were arrested in September 2015 for violation of immigration laws.“Had it not been for the intervention of Thai authorities, accused Reyes would not have been deported to face the criminal charges against him,” the motion filed by the Office of the Special Prosecutor said.“Considering accused Reyes’ previous record and to prevent its recurrence, the cancellation of his bail and his immediate commitment to prison are warranted,” it added.The Aug. 29 graft conviction arose from the renewal of the small-scale mining permit of Olympic Mines and Development Corp. (OMDC) for two years from April 6, 2006, to April 5, 2008.Prosecutors questioned the renewal because OMDC had exceeded the annual maximum extraction limit of 50,000 dry metric tons (DMT) of ore and because it had used heavy equipment in violation of small-scale mining laws.Notably, the mining company’s permit was even renewed seven months ahead of its Nov. 3, 2006, expiration, because it had exhausted its limit too early.OMDC operated in the southern Palawan towns of Narra and Sofronio Española.Court records showed that Platinum Group transported on behalf of OMDC a total of 203,399.135 DMT from May 30, 2005, to April 3, 2006, and 79,330 DMT from June 2, 2006, to July 31, 2006.Ortega’s Malampaya exposéReyes also faces 36 counts of graft in the Sandiganbayan’s Second Division in connection with irregularities stemming from 209 contracts funded by P1.53 billion in royalties from the Malampaya gas field in 2008 and 2009.Prosecutors accused Reyes of awarding 209 public works contracts to 11 construction companies in 2008, which were attended by violations of the Government Procurement Reform Act.The infrastructure contracts were also allegedly disadvantageous to the government because these contained a clause requiring the payment of liquidated damages in case of project delays.Ortega’s murder was attributed by local media to his exposé on the allegedly irregular use of Malampaya funds.Reyes had also been charged with graft in connection with the misuse of P3.25 million in fertilizer funds in 2004, but the Sandiganbayan’s Fifth Division threw out the case in May due to unreasonable delays in the Ombudsman’s investigation.",1
"A moderate labor group has described as “grossly exaggerated” President Rodrigo Duterte’s claim that the Department of Labor and Employment (Dole) had already regularized almost a third of a million contractual workers across the country since 2016.In his State of the Nation Address (Sona) last Monday, the President said that more than 300,000 workers had been regularized nationwide by business establishments since he took office.The actual number is close to 202,000, according to the Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP).“The ‘more than 300,000 regularized ‘endo’ workers’ claim by the Department of Labor and Employment as its accomplishment since 2016 is grossly exaggerated,” the group said.Endo, or end of contract, refers to a contractualization scheme that allows businesses to offer short-term and unprotected temporary work arrangements for workers.This circumvents workers’ right to at least a minimum wage, security of tenure, self-organization and collective bargaining, and peaceful concerted activities.Voluntarily regularizedThe President, who was elected on a platform that included ending contractualization, said the pace of regularization of contractual workers was still noteworthy.Based on the records obtained by ALU-TUCP, however, some 202,000 contractual employees have been voluntarily regularized nationwide.Alan Tanjusay, the group’s spokesperson, said data from the Dole showed that the additional 119,000 cited in Mr. Duterte’s speech were in fact contractual employees who have yet to be regularized since their employers were still contesting the government order.Questionable“Even the 220,000 alleged regularized endo workers are still questionable because [the number] has to be verified if they were ‘regular’ to the middlemen manpower agencies or to the principal employer and principal business owner that utilize their services,” Tanjusay said.“We urge the Dole to rectify the matter and make the necessary, accurate and honest clarification to the people,” Tanjusay said.Bello cites data sourceThe labor group said that Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III may have “misinformed” the President by bloating the number of regularized employees.But Bello, in a radio interview, denied the allegation and said his data was provided by principal employers, not by manpower agencies.“The President might hit me if I feed him wrong information,” he said in jest.The labor chief added that the number of regularized workers was still “small,” considering that there were about 900,0000 business establishments across the country.On Labor Day last May 1, Mr. Duterte signed Executive Order No. 51, which prohibits illegal labor contracting but allows some forms of contractualization.The EO dismayed labor groups.‘Outdated’ Labor CodeThe President acknowledged that a more comprehensive action on contractualization had to be done by revisiting the Labor Code, which he described as “outdated.”The EO also provides that the labor secretary may declare specific activities that can be contracted out in consultation with the National Tripartite Industrial Peace Council.“I remain firm in my commitment to put an end to endo and illegal contractualization,” the President had said.He added that in order to implement an effective and lasting solution to the problems brought about by contractualization, Congress needed “to enact a law amending the Labor Code.”",1

"Presidential peace adviser Jesus Dureza reveal the real reason why Filipina-American Millionaire Loida Nicolas-Lewis wanted President Duterte to resign.During an interview with I am Pinoy, Proud ako TV show, Dureza revealed that Fil-Am Millionaire was worried that President Rodrigo Duterte passed the Presidency to the defeated Vice Presidential Candidate Bongbong Marcos if ever that Leni loss on the recount.“I think she was more concerned and I will disclose it without her permission– na she was more concerned about sa sinabi ni President Duterte na kung maging vice president si Bongbong Marcos, then magre-resign siya as president para ibigay niya kay Bongbong ang presidency.” Dureza told the talk show host Ethel Cantor ConstantinoDureza however, denied that President Duterte was serious in his statement about Bongbong Marcos that he may became the next Vice President.“I dont think this President will relinquish anything to anyone, whether to Bongbong Marcos or Leni Robredo, on a silver platter.

"Uniformed officers assigned to the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA) will have more opportunities for promotion, according Local Government (DILG) Acting Secretary Eduardo Año.This is in response to the Bureau of Inquiry’s recommendation on the PNPA mauling case that uniformed personnel assigned to the academy should have more opportunities for promotion.Año said he found out uniformed personnel assigned to the field rather than training cadets were eithersidetracked or left behind in promotion opportunities.The Board of Inquiry, which was formed to probe the mauling incident, concluded that the PNPA had a lapse in providing sufficient uniformed officers in the academy.Romeo Magsalos, chairman of the board, previously said there were only four uniformed officers assigned at the PNPA Cadet Affairs Office for over 800 cadets, or one assigned to monitor 200 cadets.“We are in dire need of more role models and mentors who walk the talk to impart their experiences and learnings to the next generation of public safety officers. Our uniformed men and women who accept the challenge to mentor these aspiring cadets should not be left behind in terms of promotion,” Año said in a statement.He also said that he will go to PNPA this month to talk to Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) president retired Gen. Ricardo de Laon and PNPA Director Chief Supt Joseph Adnol to review the “rituals” happening inside the academy, and implement systematic reforms to prevent similar mauling incidents in the future. The PPSC is under the Department of Interior and Local Government.The PNPA, which is run by PPSC, was in hot water after six new police inspectors were beaten up by a group of underclass men after the former’s graduation rites on March 21.",1
"A Filipino-American woman residing in the United States has sent the Philippine Daily Inquirer a copy of a video showing a couple engaged in the sex act—and asked the question: “Is Sen. Leila de Lima the female in the video?”Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II has threatened that he will show a purported sex video involving the beleaguered senator at the next House committee inquiry into her alleged connection to drug lords when she was the justice secretary.The Inquirer sought people to watch the video sent by the Filipino-American and asked their comments and opinions.The video, which runs for one minute and 54 seconds, shows a woman whose slight facial resemblance to De Lima is highlighted by her wearing eyeglasses while having sexual intercourse with a man with dark features that almost look like he’s black.A dog makes its presence felt by walking away from the scene near the video’s end.The curious thing is that the woman keeps looking at the camera all throughout—as if trying to make sure her face is seen by viewers.Ironically, the people behind the making of the video intentionally blurred the woman’s face, making it virtually impossible to distinguish her identity.“It’s blurred. You can’t see the face. Although she has a similar build, and I saw still photos in an online post showing the face of the woman, no doubt this is younger than De Lima. Only those with poor eyesight or dirty minds will say this is Leila. This video is fake,” a businessman said.“My God, how fake. The woman doesn’t look like De Lima. And I doubt if the guy is (Ronnie) Dayan [De Lima’s alleged ex-boyfriend]. And the one who edited this video put a watermark of its supposed original site just when the woman turned her face to the camera,” a musician pointed out.“Photoshopped or not, it can be someone else. There are lots of porn sites that feature people who look like other people. I even saw one who resembled Hillary Clinton,” explained a photographer.“Undistinguishable. The woman was even made to wear glasses to make her look like De Lima,” said a businesswoman.‘Hocus-pocus’“It’s a big hoax … Hocus-pocus involved,” a theater lighting engineer noted.“I really can’t say it’s her, even if she kept on looking at the camera. I think it’s staged,” said a club DJ.“Is that it? Gosh, the extent of what people do … This is the worst kind of fakery,” another musician said.“Anybody who watches it will say it’s fake!” exclaimed a housewife.“It’s crazy. This is mudslinging at its lowest,” a female journalist declared.What truly makes the whole exercise dubious is that the video is splattered with the watermark title, “Senator Leila de Lima Scandal Pak Ganern,” with the video’s website source pasted at the center.As it turned out, the video’s source is a porn site.",1
"Thousands of residents here, home from evacuation centers where they fled after Islamic State-inspired gunmen laid siege on the city, joined separate community prayers for Eid al-Fitr on Friday.It was both a somber and joyous affair for residents, most of whom could not yet return to their homes in the 24 villages dubbed the most affected areas, or MAA.“We’re sad, but what else can we do?” said Juhary Pacasum, who now lives in the Sagonsongan Temporary Resettlement Area. But they’re happy as well for having survived the fasting during the holy month of Ramadan even under difficult circumstances, he added.Junader Radia, whose family also shares a home at the temporary resettlement area, said their only consolation was that a lot of people and groups helped them during their ordeal. “We were not totally forsaken,” she said.In Sagonsongan, more than 400 individuals prayed inside a newly built mosque.“At least, we did not have to go to another area to hold our prayer,” said Hadji Abdullah Mohaimen, who was originally from East Marinaut, a village within the MAA which has not been repopulated since the war ended in October.Duterte messageWhen the war broke out here on May 23 last year, the residents were still preparing for Ramadan and had to spend the fasting days and Eid al-Fitr in evacuation centers.“I know we will be able to stand again. We only need to be assisted by the government,” Mohaimen said.In his message on the feast of Eid al-Fitr, President Duterte praised Allah “for providing our nation the strength to endure the challenges of misguided ideologies, terrorism and violent extremism.”He added: “May this revered festival inspire us all to foster greater unity amid our differences in faith and culture … Together, let us engage in acts of charity as we steer our nation toward a more progressive and tolerant future,” said Mr. Duterte who was expected to lead the Eid al-Fitr celebration on Saturday evening in Lanang, Davao City.In Davao City, smiles and laughter greeted Eid al-Fitr, as families attended community prayers.The three-day Eid al-Fitr is marked by gift-giving, new clothes for children, and a festive look for most homes. It is also customary for Muslim families to prepare sumptuous meals and share these with guests and neighbors.In his Eid al-Fitr message to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao’s four million Muslims, Gov.

"Chief Superintendent Ronald Marapon de la Rosa, incoming chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), stressed that the PNP must consider quality and not quantity in order to attain victory against criminality and illegal drugs under the administration of president-elect Rodrigo Duterte.Dela Rosa said that it would be much better to have a small number of police force as long as they are sure that they will work wholeheartedly and will not engage in any illegal activity.“It’s not about the quantity that we need, quality is,” he noted.Dela Rosa said that they have to place the right person for the right position in order to fulfill the plan aimed at curbing the prevalence of illegal drugs and criminality within the time frame of three to six months.The incoming PNP chief hopes that his colleagues would understand his actions for he is only doing his job.“We need a commander who is really hands on to the job,” he described that the ideal commander is someone who doesn’t sleep, someone who answers to his call even in the middle of the night. A commander who will report to his office immediately, a commander who will be on top of the situation because they know that they can be relieved of their duty if they fail,” he explained.He guaranteed to work well if given 100,000 police officers who are true to their jobs better than a million corrupt police officials that would only add up to the problem.He noted senior officers of the PNP will have to vacate their seats once they have seen unfit to the job.“If they are already in their posts and then we see that they perform poorly, we will have them removed,” Dela Rosa said.Dela Rosa assured that the reshuffle is possible for the officials have taken an oath stating that they are willing to be assigned anywhere in the country to begin with.“You just follow orders. If the order is leave, then leave,” Dela Rosa stated.However, he said that there is nothing to worry about the reshuffle in the police force.“Why worry? They (officials) can still receive a salary while they’re on leave. In any case, they should be happy because they don’t have a responsibility to think about while getting paid,” he said in jest.Dela Rosa also assured he will exert numerous efforts to eliminate illegal drugs.”Hindi naman talaga ito masusugpo. It’s impossible na ma zero sa akin talaga is pababain to the lowest possible level yung crime at saka drugs. paano gagawin, hindi ko ilalatag mamaya malaman nila. magfail tayo dahil nalaman na nung mga kalaban. basta sa mga kalaban magugulat na lang sila,” the former chief of Davao City Police Office (DCPO) said.He also asked the public to cooperate with the PNP to accomplish the three –six month campaign.”Sa taumbayan we are pleading for your cooperation. This is the golden moment not only for the PNP but kung hindi for the whole Filipino nation dahil nakikita natin yung desire, so sa PNP we have to exploit the situation. This is the golden opportunity for us to once and for all solve this problem,” De la Rosa said, who was picked by the President elect Rodrigo Duterte to be the next PNP chief.De La Rosa, a member of Philippine Military Academy Class of 1986 hails from Davao City where he also once served as the chief of police, and partnered with Duterte in crushing criminality in the area.

"“God knows there is no truth to that, my conscience is clear,” said Chief Supt. Bernardo Diaz, the former Western Visayas police director named on Tuesday by President Duterte as one of the five officials allegedly involved in criminal drug activities.Diaz said in a telephone interview he did not know why Mr. Duterte had implicated him in illegal drugs.“I will submit myself for investigation in Camp Crame,” he said. “I hope the investigation will be conducted immediately so I can clear my name.”Retired Chief Supt. Vicente Loot, the newly elected mayor of Daanbantayan in northern Cebu, said he would also subject himself to any investigating body and would even see the President to clear himself.“I can never be a protector [of illegal drugs] because I was not involved in any antidrug operations and anticriminality campaign,” he said in an interview over TV Patrol Cebu.Chief Supt. Edgardo Tinio likewise denied he had protected drug peddlers during his term as Quezon City police chief.“I have never dipped my hands in illegal activities, adding that he was open to a lifestyle check.“My concern now is my family who may be affected by this. I know I can defend myself because I know the truth,” Tinio said in an interview over dzMM radio.Chief Supt. Joel Pagdilao, former National Capital Region Police Office chief, said he was “not a protector of illegal drugs” and was saddened by the President’s accusations. “In my 32 years in service, my work has never been tainted,” he said. “Whatever the investigation takes. I am ready to defend myself and my family name.”Worried, saddenedDiaz said he was worried and saddened about how the accusations would affect his parents, siblings and family.“Those who worked with me know my record. I have never been involved or implicated in anything illegal. I am confident that I will be cleared,” he said.Diaz was among those relieved of his post in the reshuffling of the Philippine National Police.He was relieved effective July 1 and replaced by Chief Supt. Jose Gentiles, his classmate in Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Class of 1984.Diaz was not given a new assignment but was ordered to report to Camp Crame.He was assigned as Western Visayas director in June last year and is set to retire from the service in March next year.Diaz was among four top officials who drew controversy after they were spotted by reporters on April 2 at one of the function rooms of the Novotel Manila in Araneta Center with persons identified with Liberal Party (LP) standard-bearer Mar Roxas.Black propagandaThe reporters were attending a press seminar at a separate function room across the room where the police officials were seen in a meeting with LP personalities.Diaz denied to the Inquirer that he was at the hotel.Loot, for his part, lamented that he had always been subject of black propaganda especially during elections since his family members were into politics.His wife, Maria Luisa, was mayor of Daanbantayan—a post that he now occupies after retiring from the police force in 2015. His stepson, Sun Shimura, is provincial board member.In the May 9 polls, Loot defeated incumbent Mayor Augusto Corro by mere seven votes.In a television interview, Loot said the allegations raised by the President may be linked to the 2013 white paper that surfaced when he was about to be selected Manila Police District chief by Mayor Joseph Estrada.It was a letter purportedly from the Office of Rep. Lucy Torres of Leyte’s fourth district, alleging that Loot was protecting the entry of illegal drugs intended for Eastern and Central Visayas. With reports from Nestor P.

"Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said on Tuesday that Wally Sombero, a representative of casino mogul Jack Lam, had cleared him from any involvement in the alleged extortion of P50 million from Lam.Sombero is accused of bribing sacked Deputy Immigration Commissioners Al Argosino and Michael Robles for the release of Lam’s Chinese employees at Fontana hotel and casino in Clark Freeport, Pampanga province. The employees were arrested by immigration agents last November for illegally working in the country.During a hearing of a Senate blue ribbon committee looking into the case, Aguirre disclosed that Sombero sent to him a text message of assurance under questioning by Sen. Leila de Lima. Sombero is in Singapore and was a no-show again when the committee resumed its hearings on Tuesday.“Sir, for the record I’m watching the hearings. I have the same words as General (Charles) Calima had texted you. I’m clearing you of any knowledge of this extortion scandal,” Aguirre quoted Sombero as telling him.He said Sombero told him that he would attend the next hearing set on Feb. 9 and that he had already sent a letter to the committee chair, Sen. Richard Gordon.“We will see until he (Sombero) gets here,” Gordon said. “Sombero is the key person here, because he is the one whose been operating here for a long time.”During the hearing, Inquirer columnist Ramon Tulfo said he sought protective custody for Sombero from the National Bureau of Investigation on Dec. 8 last year because Sombero claimed that he was being hunted by the chief of the Philippine National Police, Director General Ronald dela Rosa.Dela Rosa was said to be acting on the orders of President Duterte to arrest Lam and his associates for bribing Argosino and Robles.NBI Director Dante Gierran confirmed Tulfo’s statement.Director Augusto Marquez of the PNP Directorate of Investigation and Detective Management denied that there was such an order from Dela Rosa.“We will go only after him (Sombero) if there was a warrant of arrest,” Marquez said.Aguirre said the NBI placed Sombero under protective custody without informing him.",1
"Philippine presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte is running on a campaign platform of peace and order, projecting himself as the crime-fighting mayor of Davao City. His supporters often highlight the low crime rate in Davao as proof of his abilities to tackle crime.But a recent report released by the Philippine National Police shows Davao as the fourth among chartered cities with the highest crime rate from 2010 to 2015. Worse, Davao had the highest number of murders.So now begs the question: Are the mayor’s supporters supporting a myth?The other question in people’s minds: Did the Aquino administration have anything to do with the release of this report — just a little over a month before the May 9 elections — in order to boost the low ratings of its anointed candidate Mar Roxas?

"rich, middle class, and poor. The gap between and among these three classes has all but widened over many decades.But finally, Filipino housemaids and drivers have earned their own class distinction. While they are free to interact with the rich, they are not allowed in the same elevators with their employers or bosses. They either have to use service elevators, if available, or use the stairwell.This new social class has emerged as the Philippines continues to experience an infrastructure boom, especially in condominium buildings.Many condominiums in Makati and other Philippine metropolitan areas have implemented a policy barring housemaids, drivers and contractors from using elevators reserved for condo owners and tenants.The new class system surfaced after a memorandum from a condo property manager was posted on Facebook. The memo, addressed to unit owners and tenants, stated:“We would like once again to request all Unit Owners and Tenants to remind their household employees, i.e., drivers, housemaids, outside contractors, to strictly use the Service Elevator only.”“The administration office has had a number of enquiries from owners in the building on why helpers are using the Passenger Elevators when only Unit Owners/Tenants and their guests are allowed to the Passenger Elevators.”Apparently, this is a common practice in many condos in Metro Manila.Overjoyed with their newly-attained class status, housemaids and drivers have expressed relief that finally, they are being afforded the special recognition they have long clamored for.",0
"The Makati Regional Trial Court Branch 150 on Friday deferred granting Sen. Antonio Trillanes 4th’s motion to scrap the arrest order against him, and instead ordered the senator’s camp to file in five days its reply to the Justice department’s opposition.Makati Branch 150 Judge Elmo Alameda made the order after the Department of Justice (DoJ) opposed Trillanes’ motion, which gave the senator’s lawyer Reynaldo Robles a period of 5 days to file his reply to the opposition.Trillanes filed a 19-page omnibus motion for reconsideration by way of special appearance through his counsel Reynaldo Robles last October 1, where he asked the court to void its September 25 order for his arrest as it lacked “legal and factual basis.”It said that Branch 150 made a “grave” mistake in issuing an arrest order which was weighed through the basis of President Rodrigo Duterte’s Proclamation 572 which voided Trillanes’ amnesty ab initio (from the beginning).After both parties have filed their respective pleadings, the court shall deem the motion for resolution.

"In January this year, former President Benigno Aquino III denied having a direct participation in the botched operation in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, by the Special Action Force (SAF) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) that led to the deaths of 44 police commandos on Jan. 25, 2015.Aquino asked the Office of the Ombudsman to dismiss the three complaints filed against him by the relatives of the slain SAF commandos, saying he could not be directly faulted for the deaths of the troopers because of his limited involvement in the operation.He said he was not directly involved in the planning and execution of “Oplan: Exodus,” as these duties fell under the “sole discretion” of the ground commanders. Two al Qaida-linked terror suspects were the targets of the operation. One was eventually killed and the other had escaped.Aquino said the insubordination of SAF commander Director Getulio Napeñas led to the clash with Moro rebels.“If I had a fault as President at the time, it would be this: It never occurred to me that Napeñas would lie to the President of the Philippines,” Aquino said.He said he instructed Napeñas to coordinate with the military for armor, artillery, air and troop support in the event the mission was discovered and Moro rebels responded in force.But Napeñas informed the military about the mission only when the raid was underway, instead of “days before” to give the military time to prepare, he said.Two years after the botched operation, the Ombudsman filed in the Sandiganbayan charges of graft and usurpation of official functions against then PNP Director General Alan Purisima and Napeñas for bypassing the PNP chain of command.",1
"Now it’s Mar-Vi.Interior Secretary Mar Roxas on Saturday said the ruling Liberal Party (LP) was seriously considering Batangas Gov. Vilma Santos-Recto in its search for a vice-presidential running mate for him in next year’s national elections.Roxas, the LP-led administration coalition’s standard-bearer, did not say in a text message to the Inquirer whether he had already talked to Santos-Recto, but expressed confidence that the multiawarded actress-turned-politician would be an “outstanding” and “hard to beat” vice-presidential candidate.Asked if the LP was considering other potential candidates, Roxas said, “I’m smiling … So my lips are not really sealed.”On the “Mar-Vi” tarpaulin banners that have sprouted in many places in Batangas, Roxas said “those tarps are independent initiatives” of the residents of the province.During his July 10 visit to the Batangas provincial capitol, where he distributed patrol jeeps to local governments in the Southern Tagalog region, Roxas said he was open to the idea of a team-up between him and Santos-Recto.“Well, why not? It’s not for me to say. But let us just look at the records,” he told reporters.Long experienceRoxas cited Santos-Recto’s years in public service, first as Lipa City mayor and then as governor of Batangas.“A whole myriad of budgetary deficit to security, to agriculture—she faced all of that so, if we examine the records, she has the experience and capability and she always knows what to do. So it’s up to her and the people of Batangas to decide what happens next,” Roxas said.But what is truly important, he said, is pursuing daang matuwid, the Aquino administration’s reform program.Clean recordMalacañang insiders interviewed for this report agreed that Santos-Recto would be a good choice, noting she was an “outstanding government official and one not tainted with corruption.”A Palace official, who asked not to be named for lack of authority to speak to reporters, said that with her “star power” and “mass appeal,” Santos-Recto would surely boost Roxas’ presidential candidacy.Santos-Recto, who is serving her last term as governor of Batangas, has said the LP has not yet offered the vice-presidential slot to her.“No formal talks yet,” she said in a recent interview, adding she had not received an invitation from Roxas’ camp.Santos-Recto was among more than 2,000 local officials who joined an LP gathering in Greenhills, San Juan City, on Aug. 3 in support of Roxas, who received President Aquino’s endorsement as administration presidential candidate on July 31.In another interview, Santos-Recto said Roxas should personally pick a running mate with whom he could comfortably work with.“He should pick his running mate, not accept someone who is chosen by others or recommended to him. The important thing is that he should be able to work comfortably with a partner who will run the government with him for six years,” she said.She said she was thinking of running for the House of Representatives, but had not made a decision.Her husband, Sen. Ralph Recto, is up for reelection next year. Her son, film and television actor Lucky Manzano, is reportedly considering running for a local office in Batangas.Duterte’s running mateDavao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, a potential presidential candidate but remains undecided, has said Santos-Recto will be a “good choice” of running mate for him.“It can’t be (Sen.) Grace Poe because I think she has decided to run for President,” Duterte said.Poe, who topped the 2013 senatorial election, holds a commanding lead in the voter preference polls for the presidential election, but has not decided whether to run for Malacañang. The LP is trying to convince her to come aboard as Roxas’ vice-presidential running mate.She has said, however, that if she will run, she will be more comfortable running with Sen. Francis Escudero, a statement understood as a rejection of the administration’s offer for her to team up with Roxas, who needs some image burnishing.Roxas is unpopular with voters, placing third or fourth in the voter preference polls, but the LP says President Aquino’s endorsement will improve his ratings.RELATED STORIESRoxas open to running with Vilma Santos in 2016Vilma Santos: No more politics after 2016",1
"A committee created by Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to facilitate the release of benefits to survivors of deceased judges accomplished the opposite as it led to delays of up to two years, the Supreme Court administrator told the House impeachment hearing on Tuesday.Many of the spouses of the deceased judges applying for benefits were already in their 80s or 90s, but the committee did not immediately take action on the applications, according to Jose Midas Marquez.“From October 2015 to Nov. 6, 2017, no application was acted upon. If my calculation is correct, that’s a period of two years one month and five days,” Marquez told the panel.To date, according to the Supreme Court official, only 12 of 29 pending applications for benefits for widows or widowers whose spouses died before 2010 have been granted by the high court since the new system was put in place.Marquez headed the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), which used to solely process the applications for approval of the full court until the Special Committee on Civil Service and Retirement Benefits was formed by Sereno and two other justices in November 2015.Nothing illegalThe two other justices were the chairs of the Second and Third Divisions",1
"Sen. Grace Poe said on Friday that the DNA tests she took with her supposed relatives from Guimaras, Iloilo province, yielded negative results.READ: Guimaras folk not Grace Poe’s kin, DNA test revealsPoe, who has declared her intention to run for President in the May elections, was referring to the tests she said she had with her supposed aunt, Lorena Rodriguez-Dechavez, who approached her when the senator was in Iloilo.Dechavez and her kin offered to have DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) tests with the senator and even allowed the exhumation of the body of Dechavez’s father to determine if they were related to Poe.The senator told reporters accompanying her in Dagupan that “suceeding tests” with Dechavez’s family also did not produce a match.DNA tests give information on the genealogy or personal ancestry of someone. They are taken to determine if two people are biologically related.Poe was found in a church in Iloilo when she was still a baby. She was later adopted by the late actor Fernando Poe Jr. and actress Susan Roces.Her being a foundling was the subject of a petition filed against her seeking to unseat her as a senator and of the disqualification cases filed against her at the Commission on Elections (Comelec).The Comelec later canceled her certificate of candidacy for President because of questions hounding her on her citizenship and residency.Poe said she has not lost hope about her case.Rights of foundlings“In the first place, our argument in the Supreme Court is not based on DNA,” Poe told reporters, speaking in Filipino. “Our case is based on the rights of foundlings to have a status in this country (karapatan ng mga batang napulot na magkaroon ng estado sa bansang ito),” she said.Poe said there were at least three other individuals who had approached her “who wanted to get tested.” But she said that was not the basis of her lawyers’ argument in the Supreme Court.Poe said in a separate interview that even if her blood linkage with her parents was not established, “the important thing is to recognize the rights of foundlings in our country.”Roller coasterShe described her long search for her biological parents as an “emotional roller coaster,” especially when all the results of the DNA tests that she had undertaken with different individuals did not match hers.“It’s an emotional roller coaster. One moment you are hoping, and then another moment, you are not,” she said.Despite this, Poe said she was more confident now that the Supreme Court would favor foundlings like her.“I am more confident about my status at the Supreme Court because other justices see that this fight is not just about me,” she said.Poe and Susan’s love“To my rivals who say that my life is overdramatic, excuse me,” Poe said. “This is reality and it is a fact that the lives of most of our fellow Filipinos are dramatic, too. If mine is dramatic because I am a foundling, the lives of others are dramatic because they are poor or are not recognized by their own parents.”“I am grateful because I was given an opportunity by two people who truly love me,” she said, apparently referring to Poe and Roces.“Let’s not disregard the rights of every Filipino who wishes to serve our country.” ",1

"It’s official! The Material Girl is coming to Manila.Madonna will hold her first concert in the Philippines on February 24, 2016. It is the only country in Asia that is included in the Queen of Pop’s The Rebel Heart World Tour which kicks off in Montreal, Canada this September.Tickets for the Manila concert go on sale starting July 26.Already, both fans and critics are predicting that the concert will be an absolute flop, and here are the top ten reasons why:Filipino Millennials don’t know who the 56-year-old Madonna is; they only know Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus. Religious Filipino Baby Boomers know only one Madonna, the one enshrined in their Catholic parish church holding the baby Jesus. The cheapest concert ticket will sell at P3,150 ($72). That would be six days of work for minimum wage earners. The most expensive concert ticket will sell at P57,750 ($1,313.) That would be 117 days of work for minimum wage earners. The venue at The Mall of Asia seats about 20,000 people. Imagine all the empty seats at this one-night-only concert because of Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 above. Most Filipino concert goers will have to take Manila’s Light Railway, the MRT, to get to the Mall of Asia. Most will not get there on time because of the long lines to get to the trains, not to mention expected train breakdowns along the way. Madonna herself will show up late for the concert. Her limousine will be stuck in Manila traffic. Existing law prohibits celebrities and politicians from using car sirens (‘wang-wang’ in local parlance) to get through traffic jams. It is much cheaper to buy a Madonna DVD. All members of Filipino families and extended families can watch it for a single price. Madonna impersonators abound in the Philippines. And they give free shows all the time. Filipino Madonna impersonators do a better job than Madonna herself. Madonna Concert promoters will have a very small profit margin, after the Philippines’ Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue Kim Henares will have collected tax from the ticket proceeds.",0
"About 300 families have fled three adjoining villages in Datu Salibo town, Maguindanao for fear of getting caught in the crossfire between government forces and the outlawed Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), a military spokesperson said on Tuesday.Capt. Arvin Encinas, Sixth Infantry Division (6th ID) spokesperson, said troops have launched pursuit operations against the BIFF after reports of renewed harassment by the bandit group against government forces and installations in the province.The latest attempt was a strafing incident Tuesday dawn, he said.Encinas said the BIFF also planted four improvised explosive devices (IEDs) along the road in the village of Gawang, Datu Salibo on Monday.Encinas said the recovered IEDs “had the signature” of the BIFF, and were the same kind of explosive they have been using against government forces.Of the four IEDs, one was safely defused, while three others were detonated using igniters.Since last week, the BIFF has been launching “hit and run” attacks on soldiers manning checkpoints and government forces travelling to and from Army bases.The atrocities committed by the BIFF, according to Encinas, left two soldiers slightly wounded.Due to massing of BIFF forces in the so called “SPMS box” or the adjoining towns of Shariff Aguak, Pagatin (Datu Saudi), Mamasapano and Datu Salibo, the military conducted aerial assaults while ground troops scoured the interior of Datu Salibo town.Encinas said reports from village officials and residents showed that “several foreign-looking individuals were seen in the company of the BIFF.”",1

"His wife’s allegation that he amassed P1 billion in ill-gotten wealth was part of her attempt to “extort” from him, Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chair Andres Bautista said on Sunday.Bautista denied the accusations of his wife, Patricia Paz, that he kept certain bank accounts and owned some pieces of property that he failed to state in his 2016 statement of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALN).“It’s a complete lie,” Bautista said.Patricia ransacked his cabinet in their condominium unit in November last year and stole his “financial documents,” including bank passbooks that he believed became the basis for her charges, he said.If anything, Bautista claimed it was his wife who was living an “extravagant, ostentatious” lifestyle and even ran a credit card debt of P3.2 million at one point that he had to pay for.“It’s all about money. She wants to amicably settle; she wants a huge amount, which I don’t have,” he said in an interview at the unit of Patricia’s mother, Baby Cruz Vasquez, and stepfather, Daniel Vasquez, in Makati City.“This is pure extortion,” he added.Bautista said his wife asked for a P620-million settlement from him, which he rejected because he could not afford it.Responding to his wife’s specific allegations that he kept several passbooks with Luzon Development Bank, he said: “I don’t think it was that many. These monies don’t all belong to me. Most of them belong to my parents, to my brother and sister.”As to his foreign currency and peso accounts with Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., he said: “It’s possible. It’s all in the SALN.”He, however, vehemently denied keeping an account with HSBC.“That’s a complete lie,” he said. “I don’t have that. If she can produce it, it’s all hers.”On the condo unit in One Bonifacio High Street, he said that this was declared in his SALN.The property in the District in San Francisco, California, belongs to his sister, Susan Afan, according to Bautista.On allegations that he kept investments abroad, such as in the Bauman Enterprises Ltd., the Comelec chief said he had only one offshore account and that was in Singapore.As for his alleged investments in Mantova International Ltd., he said he was “trying to fix a loan, but it never pushed through.”“I don’t own any of these things. These are all fictitious; they don’t belong to me,” he told the Inquirer in the presence of his parents-in-law, the Vasquez couple.Bautista said he was willing to settle financially with his wife so he could “move on.” He said he had been keeping his “peace” for the sake of their four sons.RELATED VIDEO",1
"these are issues too overwhelming for members of the Senate and House of Representatives in the Republic of the Philippines. Theses issues are so controversial that passage of corresponding bills have become almost impossible. And the Philippine Congress is worried about its emerging reputation as a “Do-Nothing Congress.”So, in their respective current sessions, both houses are busy drafting and hearing numerous bills that would easily gain bi-partisan support, among them:House Bill 3926 to make adobo national dish of the Philippines, authored by Representative Rene Relampagos of the province of Bohol.Senate Bill 1863 seeking to impose fines on establishments that refuse to serve half-cup rice orders, authored by Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr.House Bill 3979 to require bottled water to be included in the menu of restaurants and fast food chains, authored by Representative Lorna Velasco (Partylist, AMA).Marcos’ bill aims to prevent unnecessary waste in the country’s main staple and to ensure enough rice supply even in times of calamity. Velasco’s bill seeks to replace sodas and sweet drinks which are responsible for obesity, diabetes and other health issues faced by Filipinos.In addition to these measures, the bi-partisan committee on ways and means has proposed two resolutions pertaining to the Congress itself:Resolution to change the official name of the Congress of the Philippines to “Restaurant Congress of the Philippines” to better reflect its legislative priorities.Resolution to rename bills to “menu.” So, henceforth, the above bills will be known as House Menu 3926 and 3979, and Senate Menu 1863.",0
"The Department of Transportation (DOTr) on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Singapore government for possible development of an intelligent transport system (ITS) to ease traffic congestion in Metro Manila.Under the memorandum DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade and Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE) Chief Executive Officer Kong Wy Mun agree to help the Philippines improve its traffic systems by sharing Singapore’s practices in traffic and transport management and introducing the ITS.The SCE is an agency formed by the Singaporean Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that aims to promote international trade and to link Singapore companies to other countries.The agreement also states the willingness of both parties to work hand in hand on recommending and adopting suitable traffic management policies and use of the ITS.It includes the installation and implementation of various traffic control systems, as well as the utilization of congestion management, traffic enforcement and surveillance and incident management systems.REICELENE N.

"Unscrupulous individuals or groups are roaming and promising appointment-for-a-fee to those who want to be a barangay (village) chairman, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Ismael Sueno warned on Sunday.Sueno said the DILG does not tolerate ‘shadowy schemes” and village officials who are not facing any pending case or complaint before the Ombudsman, Sangguniang Bayan (Municipal Council) or Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Council) or any other legal body should not worry about losing their post.He cited reports that groups of people are extorting money in exchange for appointment as officer-in-charge of a specific village.“We will not appoint OIC [Officer-in-Charge] barangay officials. And as I have said before, unless there is a pending case against a village chairman from a specific place, he has nothing to worry about. But unless and until that is the scenario, the incumbent chairman, prior to the cancelation of barangay elections last month, will continue serving his or her post in a hold-over capacity,” Sueno said.Earlier, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act 10923 postponing the October 2016 barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council) elections to the fourth Monday of October 2017.Sueno denied allegations that the DILG is extorting money from illegal gambling operators in exchange for protection from police actions like raids.“As a matter of fact, PNP [Philippine National Police] chief Ronald dela Rosa himself had come out openly to pledge that illegal gambling is the next PNP target. In effect, the gambling operators’ days are numbered and they should start looking for legal sources of income as early as now,” he said.Sueno pointed out that then-candidate Duterte promise to eradicate illegal activities.The Interior chief said there is no way the DILG or any department for that matter will tolerate the collection of money in exchange for favors.He also dismissed insinuations that the DILG is “collecting” money for project contracts, such as purchase of firefighting equipment as well as construction of municipal buildings.“We are not selling ‘appointments’ of any official in the local government level, whether for a barangay chairman post or Sangguniang Barangay [Village Council] membership. There is no way that the DILG will collect fees in exchange for any projects,” Sueno said.The DILG chief added that individuals or groups using the DILG to extort money from local officials or individuals can expect the full force of the law.“I have given our intelligence operatives the go-signal to round up these extortionists. We know their location but we still need the support of the public to stand as witnesses against these people,” Sueno said.",1

"Filipinos take their beauty pageants very seriously — especially women who belong to the Hashtag Babae Ako (#BabaeAko) movement, like Mae Paner, a.k.a.

"For 65 days, Dodong did everything to dodge wayward bullets coming from either Maute gunmen or soldiers.But one day, while hiding on the roof of a house from the terrorists that had rampaged through the lakeside city, a bomb fell so close to him that he was hit by shrapnel.The injury wasn’t serious, but the 41-year-old native of Cagayan de Oro City suffered from soft-tissue infection that he tried to bear as the days went by.Dodong, a father of four who came to the city to work as a carpenter only to be trapped in the fighting, said he had to endure the gun battle and the airstrikes until he escaped.“I was so scared. I prayed to God to keep me safe. Whenever the military bombed the enemy position, it was as if my ears would explode too,” he said.The carpenter was among hundreds of civilians who were trapped in the city when fighting erupted between government forces and the Islamic State-inspired militants on May 23.While many fled, he was told by his employer to stay behind, lest he be killed by the Maute gunmen if they saw him. And so he did.From the rooftop of his employer’s house, where he hid, he once saw about 100 young fighters, aged about 19 and younger, on the streets below.“I can see them from my location. They burned the houses. I saw very young fighters with guns,” the carpenter, who asked to be identified only as Dodong, said in Filipino.While on the roof, surviving on food left behind by his employer, a bomb exploded nearby.Dodong said he felt a stinging pain in his left leg. He found out later that he was hit by a splinter.But the fear of the Maute gunmen was more intense than the pain of his wound.Dodong decided to stay in the house even if bombs were exploding around him. As days passed, the number of the gunmen dwindled. Even then, Dodong said he had not dared to go out of hiding.“I can’t get out because a lot of them are just within the vicinity,” he said.But on July 28, he heard the gunmen talking about burning the house he was hiding in. That’s when he decided to escape.“I remember it was late afternoon. They were firing their guns at me while I was running away from the house,” he recounted.Dodong said he tried very hard to avoid being hit, and just kept running.It was about 7 p.m. when Dodong reached the Bangolo Bridge, according to 1Lt. Ace Guintibano of the Army’s 1st Infantry Battalion.“I felt relieved when I saw the soldiers,” he said.Dr. Samsia Dimapinto said the carpenter was in stable condition and might be allowed to go home soon.Dodong said he wanted to go home to Cagayan de Oro City as soon as possible to be reunited with his family.",1
"Philippine presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte threatened to sever ties with the United States once he is elected on May 9 this year, and U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump is thanking him for it.Duterte made the threat after U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg criticized the mayor for comments in a viral video in which he said he should have been first in line in the serial rape of murdered Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill. Duterte made the same threat to Australia whose ambassador also condemned the mayor’s comments.Upon learning of Duterte’s threat, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Trump thanked Duterte for making his job as president much easier.Trump has consistently said in his campaign that as president he will deport all undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.The real estate mogul said he will not only deport TNTs (the Filipino term for undocumented immigrants), but also revoke the naturalization papers of Filipino Americans.Trump, however, said that he is open to U.S.-based Filipinos to apply for political asylym if they can prove that going back to the Philippines will subject them to persecution under a Duterte administration.Latest census figures show that there are about 4 Million Filipinos now living in the United States.",0
"Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos on Friday echoed the statement made by her father, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, that “history was not done yet” with her family, 31 years after they were ousted from power.Opening a forum here on the legacies of Marcos, whose 100th birthday on Sept. 11 had been declared by Malacañang as public holiday in Ilocos Norte province, Imee referred to her late father’s comment when they landed at the Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu after their ouster following the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution.“We were all in tears and everyone said, ‘The end is nigh, it is finished, we are dead and doomed,’” Imee narrated.“My father said, ‘No, children. To my family and to everyone, history is not done with me yet,’” she said at the opening of the two-day Marcos 100 Forum at the Mariano Marcos State University here.The dictator died in 1989 in Hawaii but his body was flown back to the country only in 1993 when then President Fidel Ramos allowed the Marcos family to return.In November last year, President Duterte allowed the family to bury Marcos at Libingan ng mga Bayani in Taguig City despite a public outrage.“Why is it that this debate, this argument of who our President Marcos was, continues to burn unabated, a hundred years after his birth? Indeed, if the north remembers, winter has not come yet for the legacy of Ferdinand Marcos,” she said.Imee said some people had described the Marcos 100 Forum as “very disappointing because it is very simple.” But the family organized a “humble celebration for an extremely austere and simple almost monkish man like my father,” she said.She said: “There will be no parade, like what my mother [former first lady and now Ilocos Norte Rep. Imelda Marcos] wants. No concert, like what [former Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.] wants, and there will be no shows and dancing, like what I want.”Instead, the family and the Ilocos Norte government organized debates, storytelling sessions, and a lecture series “that will define Marcos 100 in this very reflective effort, the Marcos legacy,” she said.The forum began with a lecture by Antonio Contreras, a political science professor of the De La Salle University, on nationalism and how that played a role in Marcos’ 23-year rule of the country.Contreras said Marcos was the “most intellectual president the country ever had.” He said he had made this assertion for so long that his colleagues had branded him as a “Marcos loyalist.”Marcos was elected in 1965 and reelected in 1969. He declared martial law in 1972 and ruled until his ouster in 1986.Activist lawmakers reacted with revulsion to the plan of Marcos’ widow Imelda and her kin to celebrate the late dictator’s 100th birth anniversary at Libingan ng mga Bayani on Monday.Activists invitedSome of the anti-Marcos congressmen even got an invitation to the party.“Yes, I did get an invite and puked on it!” said Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin, who had opposed the burial of Marcos at the heroes’ cemetery in Taguig City.In a message thread, the “Magnificent Seven” member showed reporters a copy of his invitation sent out by Imelda Marcos, now an Ilocos Norte representative.According to the invitation, a Mass will be held at 9:30 in the morning of Sept. 11, to be followed by a short program and lunch.“With President Duterte’s blessings and absolution of their sins, including his push for their immunity from prosecution, the Marcoses are enjoying their heyday since they were booted out by people power,” he said.Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, another Marcos critic who received an invitation to the event, said the planned “party” at Libingan would defile the memory of all the heroes buried in that cemetery.“This planned party celebrating the centennial of his birth defiles the memory of all the legitimate heroes buried in Libingan ng mga Bayani even as it rubs salt on the still-bleeding wounds of the thousands of victims of the Marcoses’ brutalities, atrocities and unparalleled greed and plunder of the national coffers,” he said.Gabriela Rep. Emmi de Jesus, another anti-Marcos activist, said it would be an “irony of ironies” if the Makabayan bloc also got an invite.On Monday, Mr. Duterte issued a proclamation declaring Sept. 11 a holiday in Marcos’ home province of Ilocos Norte to mark his birth anniversary.Holiday treatThis is not the first time Sept. 11 was declared a holiday in Ilocos Norte. In 1999 and 2000, it was declared a special day in the province by former President Joseph Estrada. In 2000, then Ilocos Norte Gov. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. declared it a holiday in the province. In 2008, it was declared a special nonworking day in the province by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.Mr. Duterte has maintained a warm relationship with the Marcos family.He recently revealed that the Marcoses had offered to return part of their hidden wealth, but that it would have to be done in exchange for immunity.A staff of Vice President Leni Robredo said she did not get an invitation to the Marcos party.Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella could not say if Mr. Duterte has been invited to the event, but in any case, the President will not be in Metro Manila on Sept. 11.“He will be in Davao,” Abella said.And “unless he bilocates,” Mr. Duterte was not expected to show up at the heroes’ cemetery, Abella said.Asked if Malacañang would be sending a representative to the event, he said “it is not an official activity as far as the Office of the President is concerned.”Abella said the nonworking day proclamation for Ilocos Norte was a “one-off” event in consideration of the centenary.",1

"THE Department of Labor and Employment (DoLE) has tied up with LinkedIn, one of the top business and employment-oriented social networking sites worldwide, in addressing a mismatch between skills and the actual jobs available in the market.The mismatch is blamed as the prime driver of the country’s growing problem on underemployment.Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd on Friday said LinkedIns would provide windows of opportunity for employers to peek into the skills of its Filipino members.He added that the employment networking site has released its Philippine Skills Report, which shows the top skills of four million LinkedIn Filipino members, to help companies identify employees who fit its hiring criteria.“The Philippine Skills Report of LinkedIn bares the list of in-demand jobs and top skills of around four million of its Filipino members. It will help companies to fulfill their hiring needs and for the job seekers to find right opportunities fitted with their expertise,” Bello said.He added that the skills report will expand jobseekers’ career path decisions with increased job opportunities available in various industries, as the Philippines is currently considered as one of the Asia’s fastest-growing economies.“The Philippines is currently one of the Asia’s fastest-growing economies, but this can only be maintained if companies can find the right talent and skill to foster business growth. In support of the Philippine government’s effort, LinkedIn is helping to bridge this gap and support local business by effectively connecting talent and skill with the right opportunities,” Bello said.In the DoLE’s Labor Market Information (LMI) Report for 2013 to 2020, it identified key 275 occupations as in-demand and 102 occupations are listed as hard-to-fill from among key and emerging industries.In-demand occupations refer to active occupations/job vacancies posted or advertised recurrently. These occupations have high turnover/replacement rate and are essentials in the operations of a company.Organized labor has said that just this year, some 1.2 million college and vocational graduates find difficulty in getting a job because of a growing mismatch between their training and the job skills required by most employers.According to the Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP), through spokesman Alan Tanjusay, the job-skill mismatch crisis in the country continues to grow, resulting in stiffer competition and prompting employers to put additional qualifications into the job descriptions for them to compete.LinkedIn cited the Top 10 industry where its Filipino members came from, with Information and Technology topping the list, followed by Outsourcing, Education, Banking and Financial Services, Telecommunications, Real Estate, Healthcare, Computer Software, Oil and Gas and Manufacturing.It also bared the most hired occupations on its site to guide possible Filipino members to sign up and look for in-demand job opportunities being offered by hiring companies.Some of the most hired occupations on LinkedIn are Sales Professional, Software Developer, Customer Service Specialist, Marketing Specialist, Operations Manager, Recruiter, IT Support Specialist, Human Resource Professional, IT Consultant and Accountant.“DoLE is working hand-in-hand with other partner agencies and organizations, including LinkedIn to address job-skill mismatch in our country. We need to bridge the gap between the skills and job opportunities for better career and economic gains,” Bello said.WILLIAM B. DEPASUPIL",1
"What’s the joke about President Duterte’s promise to ride a Jet Ski to the Spratlys and plant a Philippine flag there to assert the country’s sovereignty over the area?After the President said he was just kidding when he made that vow, his spokesperson Harry Roque said this did not mean that the Chief Executive was reneging on his stand to protect Philippine territory.“The joke there is that he will literally ride a Jet Ski. But his stand remains true,” Roque told reporters.Not literallyHe said Mr. Duterte’s promise should not be taken literally and was symbolic of his position that he was ready to fight—and die—to preserve the country’s sovereignty over the disputed areas in the West Philippine Sea (WPS).“The President’s position has not changed.

"The sale of synthetic rice in the country has raised alarm bells about its effects on the health of people if consumed, prompting the Senate and the health department to investigate the matter.Sen. Cynthia Villar on Thursday said the Senate would look into the possible effects that synthetic rice would have on people’s health.To determine the composition of the “fake rice,” Villar, who chairs the Senate committee on agriculture and food, will invite experts to a hearing scheduled next week.Food safety is a crucial aspect of the issue, she said.“This is … to inform the public what this fake rice really is. We have to understand this so we will be careful. What is the health implication of fake rice?” she said at the Kapihan sa Senado forum.Health authorities are coordinating closely with the National Food Authority (NFA) to get more information on the synthetic rice smuggled into the country.The NFA Food Development Center in Taguig City, where the vNFA sent samples of “fake rice” after someone came out in the open and complained about the rice, will release the results of the laboratory analysis today.Plastic rice was first reported in Davao City.“It’s not supposed to be there but it’s there and some people have eaten it. [We are going to find out] what its possible effects on the human body are,” said Health Undersecretary Kenneth Hartigan-Go.Made in ChinaIn Davao City, NFA officials are urging the public not to panic as they await test results of samples believed to be fake rice.“There’s no cause for alarm yet,” said NFA provincial manager Virgilio Alerta. “We are not yet going to open any warehouse unless we can trace and verify the questionable rice samples.”The synthetic rice—made of potatoes, sweet potatoes and plastic shaped into grains—is reportedly being manufactured in China and exported to Asian countries, like Indonesia and Vietnam. Materials used in making pipes and cables were also allegedly used in the fake grain.Testing samplesHealth Undersecretary Go said the Food and Drug Authority (FDA) would be checking the contents of the fake grains to find out what risk they posed to human health if eaten.The NFA earlier said that scientists were having difficulty testing the samples the agency received because these were less than the one kilo needed for results to be conclusive.“The FDA is coordinating now closely with NFA on its observations and findings in order to ascertain what kind of material this is,” Go told reporters. “But definitely it does not look like food. I have not seen it myself but we are still validating.”Dianne Silva, the Davao director of the NFA, told reporters that most of the complaints the agency were receiving about fake rice were false, although they were awaiting the release on July 3 of the laboratory results of the first samples of alleged fake rice from Davao City.“Once, we traced the source of the questionable rice in Mintal (district), which was also the subject of a complaint. We bought [rice] and tried cooking it, and we did not see anything wrong with it,” Silva said.Be vigilant“Maybe, the consumers were complaining because the rice they got already stayed too long in their hands. So, it was already spoiled,” she added.But Silva urged consumers to remain vigilant and to immediately alert the NFA if they find something abnormal in the rice they buy.Silva said the NFA was closely coordinating with the Bureau of Customs and other concerned government agencies in tightly watching possible points of entry for the reported fake rice.Villar said the synthetic rice might have been smuggled into the country, since the NFA had said that there would be no more import permits to be given to private entities.Mixed with real thingEarlier, Villar called on the Department of Agriculture and NFA to investigate the reported proliferation of synthetic rice. She also warned that the fake rice could be mixed with the real rice.Aside from a nationwide inspection of warehouses and rice shops to determine who is peddling the fake rice, the senator said special attention should be given to small shops in rural areas where synthetic rice could be sold discreetly.Economic sabotageVillar said she was pushing for the approval of a bill that would categorize the smuggling of synthetic rice as economic sabotage. Economic sabotage is a nonbailable offense.The measure will be presented to the plenary when session resumes later this month.She said she expected the measure to be approved soon, adding that she would be surprised if it would not be passed during the Aquino administration.RELATED STORIESNFA, DA urged to go after peddlers of fake riceDuterte to make smugglers eat their fake rice",1
"Something is happening at the historic Club Filipino this week with allies of Interior Secretary Mar Roxas claiming he has President Benigno Aquino III’s endorsement in the bag.A staff member of Club Filipino confirmed with the Inquirer that the Liberal Party (LP) had blocked off the clubhouse’s “Kalayaan Hall” between Wednesday and Friday for an unspecified event.Roxas’ allies Iloilo Rep. Jerry Treñas and Yacap Rep. Carol Jayne Lopez said that LP members would confirm on Wednesday whether the much-anticipated endorsement would be held on Friday.“We’re still waiting for confirmation. What I know is an announcement will be made between July 29 and July 31. We’ll probably know for sure (today),” Treñas said.“We’re sure that Mar is the one. We’re just waiting for the best date and time,” Lopez said in a text message.In a text message to the Inquirer, Roxas said he did not wish to preempt the President.Pass the ball, dribble, dunk“If he passes the ball to me, I will not only dribble it, I will dunk it for daang matuwid (straight path),” Roxas said, repeating remarks to reporters after the President’s State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Monday.Club Filipino is deeply entwined in the country’s political upheavals, such as the inauguration of President Corazon Aquino on Feb. 25, 1986, in the aftermath of the Edsa People Power Revolution; then Ilocos Norte Gov. Luis “Chavit” Singson’s jueteng exposé which led to the ouster of President Joseph Estrada in 2001; and then Senator Aquino’s announcement on Sept. 9, 2009, of his bid to run for President.Passing the torchTwo highly placed sources told the Inquirer that Mr. Aquino “will likely” endorse Roxas’s presidential bid.“The President will likely make public his decision to pass on the torch of the ‘daang matuwid’ to Roxas on Friday,” one source told the Inquirer, referring to the Aquino administration’s anticorruption slogan.The second source, who was privy to the preparation, said Roxas would also formally declare his presidential bid immediately after Mr. Aquino’s endorsement.“Secretary Roxas will declare his readiness to take on the challenge of continuing the reforms initiated by President Aquino,” this source said.He said the date would also coincide with the birthday of Roxas’ mother, Judy Araneta Roxas, who had openly made known her son’s presidential bid.House Majority Leader Neptali Gonzales II said he had not gotten any official invitation, but had heard it would be on Friday.“I still don’t know. I only know what you know. What I heard was Friday,” he said.Any day nowBudget Secretary Florencio Abad, another LP stalwart, said it would either be “Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.”There were reports that the Liberal Party made a reservation at Club Filipino in San Juan City from July 28 to 31, in preparation for Roxas’ anointment as the LP standard-bearer.“I also don’t know if that is the case, because I’m not involved in the preparations,” Abad said. “It’s really between Secretary Mar Roxas and the President who should know that. And if that is the case, I’m in no position to say, I’m sorry.”Caloocan Rep. Edgar Erice, LP political affairs chair, said the President’s endorsement should happen before the weekend.“I think this week will not end before the President officially endorses Roxas,” Erice told Radyo Inquirer 990 AM.Western Samar Rep. Mel Senen Sarmiento, LP secretary general, only said: “Will text you once we get confirmation.”Lavish praiseDuring his speech on Monday, Mr. Aquino lavished praise on Roxas who slid down to Vice President in 2009 to give way to Mr. Aquino’s run.“Whether you are in or out of government, the enemies of the straight path have not stopped criticizing you. Because you count, because your words matter, they have continued to do their best to put you down; through their constant attacks on your character, your critics themselves have proven that they are afraid of your integrity, skill, and ability to do the job,” he said.“It’s only because they have nothing to boast of that they’re trying to bring you down. Mar, you are proving: You can’t put a good man down. Just as my mother and father had faith, so too should you have faith that our countrymen know who truly puts country before self,” the President said. With reports from Marlon Ramos, Jerry E.

"Having migrated in Australia 18 yrs ago was the best decision even if we lived a financially good life in the Philippines as we were both managers in our jobs but wanted a much better life for our son. You are right that in Australia we have this common courtesy, being considerate to others and equality that we tend to forget until we get to come home to the Philippines and we instantly see the race to be 'me first' in line in traffics, queuing and every single areas is so visible and stressful. We remembered what's it like then and still the same today.For those of you that talks about RACISM in Australia, I do believe that you have to travel more within the Philippines and even outside of the Philippines.Working in the popular food chain as a working student, graduating from the University, job- hunting in Manila, starting a desk job till the time I became a manager in a multinational company .... I do believe everyone reading here that racism is much worse and more visibly seen in our PHIL society than it is Australia. Any employers would favor applicants coming from Ateneo, La Salle, UP, St Pauls, San Beda etc and all the top and posh, popular universities and will always give priority in jobs, network of friends and connections. In the PH you can instantly see faces of people and conversations change when you asked ""so what school or university are you from?""The manner in how people conduct themselves, Taglish or full English speaking conversations always have the link of impressing others and a status symbol to identify 'class.' Even the location of our home, subdivision, suburb is an easy profile of who we are and where we belong in the financial and social ladder. Name dropping of relatives or friends in jobs or workplace tends to help push a work application to acceptance is still common practice in the PH. Try to recall all the unfair or sick practices we do that are not common or never practice in Australia..... Then you tell me where Racism is alive and commonly practice and implanted in our PH culture from day 1.To say that Australia is a racist country, you are one individual who never had the chance to meet the wonderful people here who will help you and share a friendship regardless where you live, school or university you came from, even if you don't have a car, doesn't matter what job you do, the way you pronounce English words, whoever you are in the sociology-economic ladder.... Aussies are great friends who don't judge you where you come from and will not need to read your background profile to respect you as a person! People are equal here, even if you are a manager or a carpenter, we are first name basis and same treatment.

"The US president cut a dashing figure when he turned up in a Barong Tagalog, as did other heads of state, at the glitzy gala dinner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit last Sunday night.He even acted the part of the host when he repeatedly raised his glass during the toast, unconsciously upstaging President Rodrigo Duterte.On his prodding, Mr. Duterte even crooned a Filipino favorite, “Ikaw.”Back in Washington, Mr. Trump trumpeted his five-nation swing through Asia as “tremendously successful,” and crowed that US-Philippine relations were back on track, thanks to his “great relationship” with “President Duarte.”Mr. Trump, however, blew his chance at pressing Mr. Duterte on human rights violations and extrajudicial killings when they sat down for a bilateral meeting.US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the trip a “flop.”",1
"A coalition of labor groups on Thursday called on President Rodrigo Duterte to “walk the talk” in ending contractualization (endo), not legitimize it, through Department of Labor and Employment (DoLE) Order 174.At a news conference in Quezon City, Buklurang Manggagawa ng Pilipinas (BMP) Chairman Leody de Guzman said they gave their full support to Duterte, especially when the latter vowed during the 2016 election campaign to put an end to endo (end of contract).For the President to be able to deliver on his promise, de Guzman added, it is a “must” to remove DoLE Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd and three undersecretaries of the department — Dominador Say, Bernard Olalia and Claro Arellano, whom he accused of committing corrupt practices.“If [Duterte] fails to fire Secretary Bello and the others, it is very clear that he is in favor of the capitalists and despite that, we will still talk to the President since we workers are used to having conversation with capitalists but we will still push for the removal of Bello. But of course, it will still hurt our workers if our President will not stick to his promise to end contractualization,” he explained in Filipino.The coalition called the Pagkakaisa ng Manggagawa (Paggawa) stands pat that Bello “benefited” from the “capitalist companies” on not ending contractualization.“It is obvious that the private companies have given Bello this go-signal to legitimize contractualization. We would like to look into this and we hope the President will heed our call,” de Guzman said.The coalition is composed of labor groups from various sectors across the country.These groups are BMP, Association of Genuine Labor Organization (Aglo), Associated Trade Union, Katipunan ng Samahang ng mga Manggagawa, Katipunan ng Makabayang Manggagawa, Kongreso ng Pagkakaisa ng Maralitang Lungsod, Metro East Labor Federation, National Confederation of Labor, National Federation of Labor, National Federation of Labor Unions, National Union of Building and Construction Workers, Pagkakaisa ng Manggagawa sa Transportasyon, Sosyalista, Solidarity of Unions in the Philippines for Empowerment and Reform, Teachers Dignity Coalition and United Filipino Service Workers.Before Bello implemented DO 174, the Labor chief first talked with employers through the Department of Trade and Industry on the points that would be indicated in the order that “only seeks to allow contractualization,” Jaime Miralles, national president of AGLO, said.Miralles said Bello should have consulted groups or workers themselves first on the drafting of DO 174.He and de Guzman said their support for Duterte “might be at stake” if he would not fire the Labor secretary.",1
"Following massive, persistent problems being encountered by the Metro Rail Transit (MRT), Malacañang on Thursday urged Metro Manila commuters to try other modes of transportation — like tricycles.“Yung MRT lang ba ang puwedeng sakyan doon sa mga rutang dinadaanan nito? Baka naman puwedeng matuklasan yung iba pang mga options,” Presidential Communications Operations Office head Herminio Coloma Jr. said during a press briefing. (Is the MRT the only means of transportation to your destination? Perhaps you can try to discover other options.)The Aquino administration specifically encouraged commuters to try riding tricycles which abound in Metro Manila. “These motorized pedicabs have been a very reliable mode of transportation in the Philippines for generations,” Coloma said.No more long lines. No more waiting. No more delays. No more accidents.",0
"Most Americans who watched almost eleven hours of yesterday’s Congressional committee hearing on Benghazi felt sorry for the Republicans who failed miserably in their mission to take down Hillary Clinton and derail her campaign for the presidency.But there is no reason to feel sorry for the former First Lady and Secretary of State. She enjoyed the free airtime to promote her presidential quest.But that’s not all.Clinton was also able to promote her book, thanks to this exchange with committee chair, Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy:GOWDY: Madam Secretary, you’re welcome to answer the question if you’d like to.CLINTON: Well, I wrote a whole chapter about this in my book, “Hard Choices.” I’d be glad to send it to you Congressman.”We can’t wait to see the results of the next presidential poll, as well as an update on The New York Times’ “Best Seller” list.",0
"He might get into trouble for it, renowned marine biologist Wilfredo Licuanan himself admitted, but he just had to say it: “The No. 1 destroyer of coral reefs in the Philippines is the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).”By exposing and eroding the topsoil into the sea when the agency builds roads and bridges, the DPWH has been steadily destroying the country’s coral reefs, said Licuanan, who has at least 30 years’ worth of marine studies under his belt.The Philippines lies at the apex of the coral triangle and is considered the richest place on earth in terms of marine biodiversity.To help update policies affecting the country’s marine ecosystem, Licuanan and four other scientists launched a three-year nationwide assessment of the reefs starting July 2014.By June 2017, the team has covered 200 sites in 31 provinces where most corals are found.The preliminary result, which was the subject of Licuanan’s talk yesterday, showed that “the corals are disappearing and reefs are having fewer organisms.”‘Obsolete’ studiesThe last nationwide assessment was done 40 years ago, and according to Licuanan, some of the methods being used to nurse the corals back to health, including coral gardening, have not been enough to reverse or slow down their decline. Policies on marine ecosystem were also based on “obsolete” studies, he added.In fact, Licuanan said, all the coral reefs placed under “excellent” category 40 years ago are gone, while about 90 percent of country’s reefs are now under “poor” or “fair” conditions.Road building projectsAside from unmanaged coastal development, blast fishing and overfishing, massive coral bleaching caused by climate change, and typhoon damage, Licuanan cited another reason behind the decline of the country’s coral reefs: road building projects that ignore problems arising from soil erosion.“Imagine (how the DPWH crew) would cut a portion of the hill to build the road. The lower portion of the road cut would be asphalted, but the upper portion, which is soil, would be left exposed,” Licuanan said.The exposed soil eventually erodes, especially during landslides, and the silt is deposited to the sea. Once the silt hits the corals, the marine creatures die “in a matter of hours,” he explained.Just rocksTo make matters worse, Licuanan said, the DPWH has engineers who are unaware that corals are live sea creatures essential to food production and a healthy marine ecosystem.Blame it on the education system that requires only licensed engineers to teach engineering students, he added.“Some engineers think corals are just rocks,” Licuanan said.The recent assessment, which aims to give the public “a snapshot of the current state of Philippine reefs,” could be used to craft policies and amend laws not only to prevent the death of coral reefs, but also to repair the damaged ones.It takes thousands of years for coral reefs to form and its current conditions could not be solved overnight, Licuanan said.“We cannot save all these reefs, but we can do something about it. We need to involve everyone. The scientists cannot do it alone. We need the local community, the management and the politicians working on these things,” he added.",1
"Senator Antonio Trillanes IV was interviewed by Stephen Sackur at BBC’s HARDtalk and shared his thoughts about President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration.Trillanes, a known critic of Duterte, criticized the current administration’s policy especially his war against illegal drugs that allegedly killed thousands of drug addicts and pushers.Sackur asked Trillanes if he can confirm that the public chose Duterte as their President because of the illegal drug problem in the Philippines.“Isn’t the truth senator Trillanes, that the Filipino public elected Duterte to the presidency because they wanted a tough guy, they wanted a guy who can impose order in the Philippines, if one looks back in the situation of the Philippines when he took over the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency stated last year that 92% of the districts in Manila for example where affected by drugs, the overwhelming drug choice is being crystal meth” Sackur said.The TV Host also said that the increasing crime rate because of illegal drugs was the reason why the people chosen President Duterte who said that he’s the one who can solve the problem.Trillanes explained that President Rodrigo Duterte ‘created his own crisis’ and he explained that despite of having 98% affected places in Metro Manila, the whole country only have “27% of the barangays” affected by illegal drugs.He also claimed that only 1.8% of the whole population in the Philippines were addicted to illegal drugs and most of them are using ‘marijuana’.“In terms of national statistics, we only have 1.8% of the population that has used illegal drugs, most of it are Marijuana compared to the global average of 5% so in fact our drug problem is not as bad as it seems” Trillanes said.Trillanes statistics that he shared to the international media was different to the statistics claimed by the Duterte administration which showed that there are almost four million addicts to crystal meth also known as Shabu in the Philippines.According to Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB), Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (shabu) remains to be the most abused illegal drugs in the Philippines.The senator also said that illegal drugs must not be prioritized by the government.“While we agree that it should be address, but it is not the primary or the only problem in our country,” Trillanes said.Since President Rodrigo Duterte became the leader of the Philippines, senator Trillanes together with his allies from Liberal Party criticized the current administration’s war on drugs and it’s alleged human rights abuses.During the election period, problem on illegal drugs became the main topic of the netizens which they believe that became the cause of many heinous crimes in the Philippines.Most Filipinos believe that illegal drugs destroyed the brain of it’s user, but Professor Carl Hart from Columbia University and U.N Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard claimed that it’s only a hoax.It’s reportedly that Shabu industry in the Philippines valued at P250 billion annually.According to PDEA. from 2010 to 2015, there are 623 government officials and employees arrested for drug possession and the Duterte administration released a thick list of government officials who allegedly involved in illegal drug business that included five Philippine National Police generals.From July 1, 2016 – May 9, 2017, there are 1,266,966 self-confessed drug addicts surrendered to the authorities, 72,812 were arrested and 2,949 were killed during anti-drug operations.",0
"Militant lawmakers are not about to step on the brakes in their sharp riposte to former Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile’s thoughts about the iron-hand rule of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.Enrile, as defense chief, was the martial law administrator during the Marcos regime.Kabataan Rep. Sarah Elago said Enrile’s recollection about the martial law regime, which he made during an interview with former Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., was a “clear attempt to deceive and misinform the public.”Elago said it was “a grave insult” to those who had died fighting the Marcos dictatorship, regarded as one of the darkest periods in the country’s history.“This deliberate attempt to whitewash and erase their existence and demise is part of the Marcoses’ calibrated efforts to rehabilitate themselves and go back to power,” she said in a statement.“The youth and the people will frustrate this great treachery. We can and will never forget our martyrs and the generations before us who fought valiantly for our rights, freedoms against the mad dictator,” she said.‘Fake history’Act Teachers Rep. Antonio Tinio said Enrile’s claim that nobody was tortured or arrested for criticizing Marcos was a travesty of the memories of those who fought to end the 14-year military rule, a period characterized by massive human rights abuses and corruption.“If President Duterte has fake news, the Marcos family and Enrile have fake history,” Tinio said.He assailed Marcos and Enrile for making public the video of their conversation as the nation marked the 46th year of the declaration of martial law.“The message that thousands of Filipinos who attended the martial law anniversary wanted to send to Marcos, Enrile and Duterte is this: ‘There will be a day of reckoning for you,’” Tinio said.",1
"Donald Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe Organization, has proposed that Miss Colombia and Miss Philippines should be proclaimed “co-winners” in last Sunday’s Miss Universe pageant.The Republican presidential candidate was asked by Matt Lauer on NBC’s “Today Show” what his solution would have been following the crowning error in which host Steve Harvey first announced that Miss Colombia had won the pageant, only to reverse himself minutes later, saying that Miss Philippines had actually won.“I’ll tell you what I think I’d do. I think I’d make them a co-winner (sic). It’d be very cool,” he said.The Adobo Chronicles caught up with Trump as he was leaving his Trump Towers in Las Vegas today.We asked him what would happen with a single crown if there were two winners.“I will donate a second crown. Even if I no longer own the Miss Universe organization, I am happy to resolve this embarrassing situation,” Trump said.This year’s Miss Universe crown was designed by Diamonds International Corporation (DIC), one of the pageant’s sponsors. It is inspired by DIC’s Czech roots and the pageant’s home base, New York City.The crown is made up of 33 Bohemian crystals, five blue topaz stones, 198 blue sapphires, and 311 diamonds. It is estimated to cost $300,000.“The cost for a second crown would be peanuts to me. I’m very rich,” Trump reminded us.The new owners of Miss Universe, WME/IMG, have not indicated whether they will accept Trump’s suggestion and donation.",0

"A school security guard fired a warning shot in a bid to stop a brawl that broke out among students of opposing schools at the end of a basketball game in Quezon City on Friday.In video taken and posted on Facebook by Mony Santos, it can be seen that students were throwing punches and plastic chairs at one another in the middle of the basketball court.Shortly after, a security guard stands at center court and fires a warning shot, apparently to diffuse the free-for-all.Santos explains in his Facebook post: “Championship game ng basketball yan..medyo mainit ang labanan..actually tapos na yong laro nagkamayan na nga…may mga students na nagkaasaran.. ayon nagkatulukan.. nagkagulo na (That’s a championship game… a bit intense. Actually, the game was over and there were handshakes… but some students resorted to teasing… then shoving, and all hell broke loose).”In the same post, Santos identifies the location of the brawl as Saint Patrick School of Quezon City and the visiting team as AMA University.“Nagulat nga kami bakit kailangan magpaputok ng guwardiya sa gitna ng gym.. puro mga bata lang yon at ’di criminal (We were shocked why the guard had to fire a shot in the middle of the gym… they were kids, not criminals),” Santos, an uncle of one of the students present at the game, said in his post.He also bewailed how some adults even joined the brawl instead of help stop the chaos.“Sana ’yong ibang katulad namin matanda tumulong na lang sa amin umawat… kaso tumulong pa makipag away at mambato ng upuan (Other adults like us should have helped pacify the fight… but instead of doing so, they joined the fray and threw chairs).”The Manila Bulletin has reached out to the two schools involved in the incident to get their side, but has yet to receive a response as of posting.",1

"Despite having P15 billion at its disposal, the Manila airport authority admitted Wednesday that it did not provide food, water or accommodation to passengers who were stranded at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) after a Xiamen Air Boeing had skidded off the runway.General Manager Eddie Monreal of the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) made the admission upon questioning by Senator Ralph Recto at the Senate hearing on the accident.The heavily damaged Xiamen Air plane led to the closure of the runway starting lateAug. 16, bringing chaos to airport operations for several days and misery to a quarter million passengers whose flights were canceled, diverted or delayed for hours.Thousands of passengers, including overseas Filipino workers, were stranded at Naia for days and were left to their own devices.Better treatmentSenators called for better treatment of stranded and affected passengers, such as providing them food and accommodation even if the reason for flight delays was force majeure.Responding to Recto’s query, Monreal estimated that around 250,000 passengers had been affected by the mishap.Naia serves some 115,000 passengers a day. Monreal noted that a smaller runway continued operating.The senators also questioned airport authorities about the entry of 61 uncoordinated flights at Naia that further exacerbated the disruption created by the runway closure.“Many of us saw the big mistakes of the management of the airport and of the [Department of Transportation],” Senator Grace Poe, chair of the public services committee that led the hearing, told reporters.At the hearing, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said that he came to the Naia only a day after the Xiamen Air plane had skidded off the runway.But Tugade said he did not visit the accident site.Senator Nancy Binay said Tugade should have been at the scene.“You were never seen during the critical moments of the crisis. Isn’t it that being on top means being there?” Binay said of Tugade.Tugade said he had been “on top of the situation,” and was in constant coordination with airport authorities.“I didn’t go to the airport because I didn’t want to slow them down. If I go there, the people might just be distracted,” he said.According to him, he did not want to go to the site of the accident because he might just give out orders that would contradict directives given by the crisis committee.Tugade said airport officials called him past 1 a.m., shortly after the runway accident on Aug. 16 and had been in constant communication with them over the phone.He said he was in touch with Monreal.Monreal said he and Director General Jim Sydiongco of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines were at the scene as Tugade’s lieutenants.“Me and the DG, the two of us had 80 years of experience combined. [Tugade] was giving me instructions,” he said.Uncoordinated flightsBinay, though, was unconvinced. “How can you say you were on top of things when 61 flights were able to get past you?”Monreal said these were flights that failed to coordinate with airport authorities 24 hours before their arrival, as protocol dictates.The airlines may have been eager to send new flights to help the affected passengers, he said.But since the airlines did not follow protocol, they will be fined, the MIAA official said.",1
"International Women’s Day was quite a day for Philippine Senator Grace Poe. On this very day, the Supreme Court ruled, by a 9-6 vote in her favor, paving the way for the foundling and former dual citizen to run for president. The high court threw out the disqualification case against her by respondents who claimed she was not a natural-born citizen and lacked the residency requirement to run for the country’s highest office.Just hours after she learned of the court decision, Poe received an overseas call from Hillary Clinton, former U.S. First Lady, Secretary of State and now candidate for U.S. president.,During that 3 a.m. call, Clinton informed Poe that she was endorsing her candidacy for Philippine president and that she was looking forward to meeting her in person when both of them have become presidents of their respective countries. “I would love to be your roommate during the world leader summits that we will be both attending,” Clinton told Poe.Today, Poe returned the favor and officially declared that she was endorsing Clinton not only for the Democratic nomination but for the presidency.Poe said she is looking forward to be in the company of many women world leaders, adding that it was about time that women were taken more seriously to be heads of state.If elected, Clinton will be the first female U.S. president, while Poe will be the Philippines’ third, following in the footsteps of Cory Aquino and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.",0

"LINGAYEN, Pangasinan—Some 100 poor but deserving incoming college students, who will top the qualifying examination on May 12, will receive financial assistance for the academic year under the Provincial Scholarship Program (PSP).Chief Administrative Officer Irmina Francisco, PSP management, evaluation and excellence committee chairperson in an interview Thursday, said PSP has been stopped for two years due to the implementation of senior high school under the K-12 curriculum of the Department of Education (DepEd), thus there were no incoming college freshmen students for the last two years.On May 12, about 2,486 incoming first year college students will simultaneously take the exam in Pangasinan National High School in Lingayen (for districts 1-3) and Juan G.

"A ROMAN Catholic Church official on Monday said the call of Pope Francis for the Church and Christian communities to apologize for their treatment of gays and other groups throughout history did not mean a change in the Church doctrine on homosexuality.Fr. Jerome Secillano, executive secretary of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) Episcopal Commission on Public Affairs, said Francis’ statements expressing compassion for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) community again showed his humility.“But it has to be emphasized that the Pope’s apology is not in any way related to the doctrine of the Church on homosexuality,” Secillano said in a text message to reporters on Monday.Respect, compassion“What the apology implies is that homosexuals should also be treated with respect, compassion and with high regard for their dignity as human beings,” he added.In an earlier pastoral statement, the CBCP expressed compassion for homosexuals and stressed that sexual attraction toward a person of the same sex was not a sin but “objectively disordered” in light of its understanding of marriage based on the catechism of the Catholic Church.‘Contrary to natural’In August last year, the CBCP president, Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas, stated in a pastoral letter that homosexual acts or practices were “contrary to the natural” and “hence, they are, from the perspective of natural law, gravely disordered and considered ‘sins gravely contrary to chastity.’”The pastoral statement was issued last year as LGBT activists pushed to have same-sex unions legalized, which would require a law to be passed in the Philippines where divorce and abortion are still illegal mainly due to Church pressure.",1
"China has agreed to support talks on crafting the proposed code of conduct in the South China Sea, and reaffirmed its respect for freedom of navigation in the vital maritime route.Chinese President Xi Jinping relayed this message to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte in a bilateral meeting in Da Nang, Vietnam, which was described as “frank” by Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque.The two leaders held bilateral talks on bilateral cooperation and other concerns at the end of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.“Dalawang punto ang napag-usapan ano ang mangyayari sa code of conduct. Ang sinagot ni President Xi ay nagkasundo na sa framework of code of conduct at ipagpapatuloy ang usapin at inaasahan niyang matatapos na ito (Two points were discussed. First, what will happen to the code of conduct. President Xi said there has been an agreement on the framework on the code of conduct, and the talks will continue. He expects the talks will be completed soon),” Roque said after the meeting between the two leaders.Heads of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China earlier adopted the framework for further negotiations on the code of conduct in the disputed South China Sea. Leaders from these nations are expected to announce the actual start of the negations during a regional summit this week.Duterte earlier said he intended to ask Xi to finally agree to the code of conduct to avoid conflict and ease tension in the South China Sea. He also wanted to raise the regional bloc’s “wary and worry” over China’s growing militarization in the disputed territories.Xi also assured Duterte that China does not object to the principle of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, according to Roque.“Ang sabi ni Xi ay walang banta sa freedom of navigation naririyan yan. Wala silang pipigilin (Xi said there is no threat to freedom of navigation. It’s still there. They will not stop anyone),” Roque said.On the tension in the Korean peninsula, Roque said Xi pushed for a peaceful dialogue among concerned parties to resolve the conflict. He said Xi assured China does not want any escalation of the conflict in the area.“They are encouraging na magusap ang US at ang North Korea. Responsablemg bayan ang Tsina, member ng UN sec council at ipapatupad ang mga security council resolution [They are encouraging a dialogue between United States and North Korea. China is a responsible country, a member of the Security Council and will implement the Security Council resolutions],” he said.Roque said Xi also affirmed China’s strong relations with the Philippines would continue. He said China promised to continue to provide assistance and support to the Philippines.“Because of the new and strong relationship between China and the Philippines, economic, military, cultural and other ties will be ever stronger,” Roque said.Xi also commended Duterte’s leadership in the region, citing the “excellent” relations between China and the ASEAN. The Philippines will host the regional summit next week.Roque said Duterte also invited Xi to visit the Philippines during their meeting. The Chinese leader reciprocated the gesture by inviting Duterte to visit China again.",1
"Senators and former leaders paid tribute to the late Sen. Edgardo Angara on Wednesday for being a great visionary, an exemplary public servant and a trailblazer when it comes to legislating laws that will be benefit generations of Filipinos.Angara was at the Senate on Wednesday for the last time, his home for almost 20 years. The ceremony was attended by his wife, Gloria, and children Alexandra Leia, Katerina Gloria, Anna Rosalyn and Sen. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, relatives, colleagues from the law profession, and friends.Angara, 83, suffered from a heart attack on Sunday in his Tagaytay resthouse.Former presidents Joseph “Erap” Estrada, now the mayor of Manila, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, now a representative of Pampanga, were among Angara’s former colleagues who delivered their eulogies.Estrada described Angara as “a tool to change lives.” The late senator was part of his Cabinet as agriculture secretary and executive secretary months before he was ousted.“We’ve lost a public servant of the highest integrity and a legislator with compassion, an intellectual with the heart for the poor, a champion for the cause of education,” Estrada said.“It was a great honor to be his friend. I have such high hopes when I chose him as my running mate in 1998 presidential elections. I knew that I can rely on his loyalty, intelligence and desire to uplift the Filipinos from poverty,” he added.Arroyo recalled that when Angara became a member of the 1971 Constitutional Convention, her father, former president Diosdado Macapagal, “identified him as one of the young turks destined to a bright political future.”“Indeed he went on to achieve so much for so many especially education, for the economy, the farmers, and the elderly. In 1992 when he was chairman of the Senate committee on finance, he sponsored the Mt. Pinatubo law, to provide P10 billion to rehabilitate my disaster-torn region,” she said.“Principle and strategic direction guided his legislation. His congressional commission on education led to his well thought out laws creating CHEd (Commission on Education) and TESDA (Technical Education and Skills Development Authority),” Arroyo added.Former Senate president Aquilino “Nene” Pimentel Jr., as well as former Senators Rene Saguisag and Pia Cayetano also delivered their eulogies.In response to the accolades given to his late father, Sonny Angara said that the former “loved the Senate.”The late senator will be buried in his hometown in Baler, Aurora on Saturday, May 19.“He treasured the time he spent here. He called them the best years of his life and the relationships he formed and the bonds he formed with many of you here meant so much to him,” Sonny said.Sen. Franklin Drilon said Angara’s sterling accomplishments in the fields of politics, public service, law, and the academe cemented his niche in the nation’s life and history.“The impact of the laws he authored, such as the Free High School Act, the Senior Citizen’s Act, PhilHealth Act and many more, will be deeply felt and appreciated by generations of Filipinos,” he said.The Senate presented Resolution 105 to Angara’s family that highlighted his achievements in government service, including the landmark laws that he authored.Angara was the longest serving senator in the post-EDSA Senate. Except for a mandatory term break, he was elected to four consecutive terms of six years each.He started his political career when he was elected in Quezon province as one of the youngest delegates to the 1971 Constitutional Convention. A year later, he founded together with an enterprising group of law classmates what would become one of the country’s top law firms, the Accra Law Offices.Angara pushed for the passage of some of the country’s most memorable laws such as the Free High School Act, Commission on Higher Education (CHEd), Technical Education and Skill Development Authority (Tesda), the National Health Insurance Act (Philhealth), Senior Citizens Act, the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA), the Renewable Energy Act and the Procurement Reform Act.He also authored and sponsor of the laws creating the National Museum, the National Commission on Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the Natatanging Manlilikha Award which bestows honor on the Filipino folk and traditional artists. He also authored the National Book Publishing Industry Development Act and the National Cultural Heritage Law.",1
"Today, Palm Sunday, is the official start of the Roman Catholic Church’s Holy Week, culminating next Sunday, Easter.Baguio City, the nation’s summer capital, is starting to get really crowded as people from the lowlands — including politicians and celebrities — troop to this mountain resort to escape the scorching heat and enjoy Baguio’s cool weather.Just in time for this solemn season, Pope Francis has just announced that he has entered the world of Instagram. This, in addition to his existing Twitter account. It was welcome news for many Catholics visiting Baguio.In just under twelve hours, Francis’ Instagram account generated more than 1 Million likes and is expected to equal, if not surpass his Twitter likes of 26 Million.And guess who’s not happy about all this? AlDub (the sensational love team of Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza, stars of the kalye serye on the noon-timle show ‘Eat Bulaga.’)Although AlDub is credited for a record 39 Million tweets, thrashing the 35.6 Million record of the 2014 FIFA World Cup slemi-final match bvetween Germany and Brazil, their “likes” on both their Twitter and Instagram accounts have a lot to be desired.Depending on which AlDub site you’re following, the couple’s (and their fans’) Twitter page likes is anywhere between 88,000 and 350,000. Their Instagram page likes is about 230,000. Both are a far cry from the Pope’s Twitter record and expected Instagram following.Well, AlDub fans, you can’t have it all.In the meantime, AlDub’s competitor TV celebrity, Vice Ganda, is reportedly about to launch an unprecedented social media campaign to outdo AlDub’s record (she has been trying for so long).

"Byaheng Bukid Series of Manny PiñolIn a quick visit to the Cagayan Valley Provincial Capitol on the way back to to Manila from Apayao on Friday, I met with the new Governor, Manny Mamba, to bring him good news.The Philippine Rural Development Program, a project funded by the World Bank with counterparts from the national government and the local government, has approved three major road projects for Cagayan Valley amounting to over P600-M.These huge infrastructure projects which support agriculture are:– Alcala East Farm to Market Road in Alcala town composed of 13.1 kilometres of road concreting and an 87 lineal meter long bridge worth P200.025-M.This project has already been bidder out and is scheduled to be awarded to the winning contractor.– Namabbalan Norte-Baliuag-Bical-Cabbo Farm to Market Road in Tuguegarao City with 17.4 kilometres of concrete road and 57 lineal meters of bridge amounting to P200.613-M.This project is scheduled for rebidding since the first bidding failed.– Iraga-Bayabat Farm to Market Road in Amulung and Solana towns with 20.25 kilometres of concrete road and 143 lineal meters of bridge worth P203.195-M.This project is up for bidding.There were initial concerns over the implementation of the project because these are located in the bailiwicks of the political opponents of Gov. Mamba.The new Governor, however, displayed statesmanship by declaring that the implementation of development projects in his province would not be tainted by politics.On Friday, I turned over to Gov. Mamba the documents covering the three projects which would contribute greatly to agricultural production in the very large and rich province of Cagayan Valley.The PRDP is one of the major foreign-funded projects being implemented by the Dept. of Agriculture. It includes the construction of roads and bridges, financing for livelihood projects and facilities which would contribute to greater productivity.Not many people know this, but the PRDP actually is the national version of the Mindanao Rural Development Program which was started in Mindanao covering five provinces including North Cotabato.This was launched when I was Governor of North Cotabato and I was deeply involved in the conceptualisation, planning and implementation of the first MRDP program.In fact, the first headquarters of the MRDP was situated in Kidapawan City, North Cotabato and I proudly declare that North Cotabato was the outstanding performer during the first implementation of MRDP.Owing to the success of MRDP, the World Bank and the Philippine Government decided to implement it nationwide calling it the PRDP.Recently, I signed new loan documents involving the allocation of an additional $450-M financing from the World Bank for the extension of the PRDP.In my sorties, I have emphasised to the local government leaders that they should participate in the PRDP program because the implementation of the projects is excellent owing to the safety nets observed by the PRDP-World Bank because of its vast experience in implementation rural development projects.While I did not stay very long in the provincial capitol, I assured Gov. Mamba that I will be back in the third week of September for a series of consultations called “Tapatan: Gobyerno at Mamamayan” which would cover Cagayan Valley, Isabela and Kalinga.Any thoughts?

"Two US-based Filipino nurses have been sentenced to spend several months in jail for performing sexual acts with each other in front of their 98-year-old female charge in 2011.Alfredo Ruiz and Russel Torralba, both 43, were sentenced to 325 and 365 days in prison, respectively, according to a report by Times of San Diego. In addition to the jail time, the two were also sentenced to five years of probation.Both had pleaded guilty to the felony charge of inflicting mental suffering on an elderly person last February 5.The Adobo Chronicles caught up with the the two nurses after their court sentencing. They said they thought that the camera that recorded their sexual act was a live cam that was broadcast on the Internet. “We were hoping porn film producers would see the live video and offer us lucrative roles in porn films. We heard porn actors are paid very well, more than the minimum wage we get as caregivers for the sick and elderly.”Now, that’s really sick, we think.",0
"with stipends to boot. We’re asking why all these have not been done to SCU students who are also “iskolar ng bayan” and on whose shoulders the nation puts lots of expectations.Rep. Elago is correct: The tuition-free policy is indeed a game changer for SCUs. SCUs will finally stop telling students the same false arguments private schools tell about high quality education supposedly costing more and that the public should directly bear its cost.For with this tuition-free policy in SCUs, Congress addresses the adverse impact of the Education Act of the Marcos dictatorship and the Higher Education Modernization Act of the post-Marcos administrations. These laws provided SCUs the license to impose runaway increases in tuition and other school fees that betray the mandate of public tertiary schools.It remains an issue of investment, and realigning public funds to such a productive and socially beneficial expenditure. Between alloting funds to revive the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant and adding more funds to SCUs, it is a no-brainer that we would be better off investing in the education of more engineers and scientists. The first is crazy and possibly corrupt. The second could lead us to a future with adequate green energy, poverty alleviation, and social mobility among many benefitsSome might say P8 billion is already too much, and additional funds may adversely affect other expenditures and investments. Yet we should only remember that the previous administration corrupted P200 billion in taxpayer money for presidential pork barrel. Even doubling, tripling or quadrupling the P8 billion to upgrade and expand SCUs would sound infinitely more reasonable and more responsible.National democrats and progressives should demand more in terms of funding so that SCU students could really be more like actual scholars. The National Union of Students of the Philippines and the College Editors Guild of the Philippines have reported that miscellaneous other school fees now outpace basic tuition in many SCUs. How would the new Congress policy address this?We also hope colleges and universities under local governments follow the lead of Congress, and totally defray costs that they now pass on to students.It is understandable that many are in a state of disbelief. They cannot yet accept the news and instead raise a whole lot of questions, like whether this is true 100 percent or worrying how it would be implemented.For instance: Would the University of the Philippines be covered or would the government keep UP students the highest-paying “scholars” in the country? Change must come to UP too; UP must stop thinking like a private school when it comes to tuition.This is a radical step in course-correction. Thus, it would be messy, as we could sense from the disbelief of many, because it seeks to overturn how tuition and other school fees are pegged in SCUs. We could only tell them to keep calm and accept this positive change, and to discard the wrong notions about who should bear the costs of public education.Rep. Elago and the youth movement led by the NUSP and the CEGP are out there. They have a keen eye not just on the next steps. They are also vigilant on the possible “resbak” of capitalist educators inside and outside SCUs who view students as customers, education as a mere commodity, and schools as merely a conveyor belt that produces cheap and docile workers for the backward and pre-industrial economy.We must embrace tuition-free SCUs as a first bold step towards a national, scientific and mass-oriented education that the country needs and wants, and away from the colonial, commercialized, and repressive education that we know suffer from.Follow me on Twitter @tonyocruz and check out my blog tonyocruz.com",1
"ADMINISTRATION standard-bearer Mar Roxas and Vice President Jejomar Binay on Monday signed a “covenant for truth” Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle and his diocese put together for candidates in the May 9 elections.“It is not enough to seek blessing without responsibility,” Tagle said in his homily during the Mass to mark the signing of the TRUTH (Truthful, Responsible, Upright, Transparent and Honest) covenant for the upcoming elections initiated by the Archdiocese of Manila, through its radio network Radio Veritas.Tagle reminded candidates vying for various government posts that public trust was a blessing that came with serious responsibilities and obligations.He said that while elected officials of the land had the freedom to act and think, they had the duty to listen to the people.Radio Veritas invited all the candidates for national elective positions for the signing of the covenant, but only Roxas and Binay showed up among the five presidential candidates.Sen. Grace Poe said scheduling problems prevented her from attending the event. She said she had requested a meeting with the organizers so she could sign the covenant.“From the very beginning, I’m for unity, I’m for peace, especially when it comes to our elections, it has to be peaceful,” she said.Vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo could not attend the event but she sent a representative, her niece Dr. Gaile Robredo-Vitas.Senatorial betsFifteen senatorial candidates from various political parties were also in attendance, including Martin Romualdez.“I praise their (Catholic Church) compassion for the Filipinos and I believe that the Comelec will not compromise the future of this country by ensuring just, honest, clean, and peaceful elections,” Romualdez said.He said that voters themselves should remain vigilant and support the Commission on Elections in its efforts to prevent cheating.In his sermon, Tagle said the candidates had the obligation to make it clear to themselves what human dignity and human rights meant to them and what they thought the common good entailed.“If voters need to study [their candidates], candidates must also study… the needs of the people who trust them and this already transcends party politics in the interest of the common good,” he said.“To all the candidates present here, being a candidate is in itself a blessing. But if the nation puts its trust on you and you get elected, you represent its dreams and the common good. You are blessed but you have a great responsibility,” he added.‘Don’t waste vote’In the same breath, Tagle also exhorted the Filipino people—rich or poor, literate or illiterate, esteemed or not—not to waste their right to vote and the opportunity to participate in forging the country’s destiny, which in other parts of the world remained a dream.But he said “participatory voting” should also be exercised with “great responsibility” by also carefully scrutinizing the candidates. “Let go of selfishness and think about what is for the common good,” Tagle said.It was in recognition of this freedom to participate that Catholic bishops do not impose voting for particular candidates, Tagle said.“We don’t want to preach participation at the same time curtail the people’s capacity to participate intellectually, rationally and with conscience,” he said.But he underscored the importance of being well informed before participating in the collective effort of building a good future for the country.“How can we participate if we don’t study or scrutinize? How can we participate if the values that should set our standard are unclear?” he asked.Answerable to peopleAfter the elections next week, Filipinos should still continue to participate in the democratic process by making the elected officials answerable to the people, and should their response be found wanting, the people could make their voices be heard again by not voting for them in the next elections, he said.“A democracy is a project of never-ending participation and in between elections, it takes the form of making our representatives answerable to the people,” Tagle said.“Whether our choice won in the elections, our responsibility to participate does not end after we cast our ballots … participation in a democratic process is a daily event [so] make your voice heard and make our representatives accountable to the common good,” he added.

Justice must be immediately delivered,” Pelligrini said.Acorda, 36, died on May 31 from injuries he sustained after he was beaten up by the suspect.“The Philippines expresses its appreciation to Prime Minister Peter Pelligrini for assuring us that justice will be served for the death of our kababayan (compatriot) Henry John Acorda,” Cayetano said.Ambassador Ma.

"Dumbfounding and disturbing.Several lawmakers on Friday were appalled at the decision of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to include alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles in its witness protection program (WPP), a step closer to making her a state witness.“What an unbelievable, crazy development,” said Senate President Koko Pimentel.“Do some people in the DOJ really believe that Janet Lim-Napoles is qualified to be a state witness in the PDAF (Priority Development Assistance Fund) scam, which she herself invented, organized and perpetuated?” the Senate leader said in a text message to reporters.Confidential affidavitNapoles was admitted provisionally into the WPP on Feb. 27 but the DOJ’s move was disclosed only on Friday.Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II clarified on Friday that she was still not a state witness as prosecutors were still assessing a confidential affidavit she had submitted.Being covered by the WPP would allow her transfer to a more secure and comfortable accommodation from her Bureau of Jail Management and Penology detention cell in Bicutan where she is being held while on trial.Napoles is facing five plunder cases along with several other graft and malversation charges in connection with scams involving PDAF and Malampaya funds—the government’s share from the natural gas wells off Palawan that was supposed to be used for victims of two major storms in 2009.Sen. Risa Hontiveros called the DOJ move a “travesty of justice,” which she said was not surprising under President Duterte.“After all, this is the same government that used the testimonies of convicted and self-confessed drug lords (who have everything to gain and nothing to lose) to intimidate and unjustly incarcerate one of the leading figures of the political opposition,” she said, referring to Sen. Leila de Lima.Hontiveros and fellow opposition lawmakers Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano and Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin believe Napoles may now be used by the Duterte administration to go after its enemies.“The government’s provision of witness protection for Janet Lim-Napoles would now afford her means to just point and put blame on anyone as has been the habit of this administration,” Alejano said.Sen. JV Ejercito said he was “disturbed and dismayed” by the reports.“This is a setback in our fight against corruption and the pork barrel system. I am not prepared to accept the idea that Mrs. Napoles is the least guilty in the PDAF scam. Napoles rigged the system in order to enrich herself and others at the expense of the public,” he said.Review DOJ performanceEjercito, whose half-brother, former Sen. Jinggoy Estrada, is among those charged in the pork barrel scam, urged Mr. Duterte to review the DOJ’s performance.Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales said Napoles’ new status “has no effect on the cases under trial in court.”Sen. Panfilo Lacson tried to calm his fellow lawmakers, saying the Ombudsman, not the DOJ, was prosecuting the PDAF cases, “which means that the DOJ has no control whatsoever over (Napoles’) possible discharge as a state witness.”He said it would be the court that would decide whether she may be dropped from the case and used as a witness.“What is interesting in this move of the DOJ is, who Ms Napoles will implicate who have not been investigated and charged yet,” he said.Villarin said the justice system was being “weaponized” to silence the political opposition by the DOJ under Aguirre.“After the DOJ prosecutors absolved confessed drug lord Kerwin Espinosa, Peter Lim, Peter Co, among others, and after using them against Sen. Leila de Lima, now Aguirre is setting up Napoles as state witness to implicate former officials of the Aquino administration, including incumbent elected officials,” he said.Some of the whistle-blowers who were key witnesses in the pork barrel racket were alarmed and confused by the DOJ’s decision, their lawyer, Stephen Cascolan, said.‘Cases may be diluted’“Where is this leading to?” Cascolan asked. “After looking at the official certification of the DOJ, we only got confused because her (provisional) admission did not mention to which cases she would be used as witness.”He said there was no need for the DOJ to place her under the WPP since she was already being held in a state facility.The whistle-blowers were worried that Napoles’ possible testimony would only lead to the dismissal of the pork barrel scam cases, he said.“The cases may be diluted and their credibility as witnesses would be eroded,” Cascolan said.",1
"THE Bureau of Customs (BOC) will continue processing and releasing of all imported meat products even as the Department of Agriculture (DA) has ordered recall and revalidation of all import permits for meat and agricultural products after it was uncovered that they were being used as tools in technical smuggling.A United Nations report showed that bulk of the imported meat products that entered the country were declared as offal–by-products of a butchered animal–as compared to good meat.Offal is levied only a 5-percent tariff as compared to 35 percent for good meat.“As per UN report there is a big discrepancy between the good meat and offal that we received in the country. There is a huge increase in offal importation because offal has only 5 percent tariff, while good meat is 35 percent. There is technical smuggling,” Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said over the weekend.It was also discovered that import permits were being recycled and reused, and sold for millions of pesos to unscrupulous importers.But stakeholders have raised concerns on having to pay undue demurrage and storage fees amounting to P4,500 per day for every container van.Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon clarified that he is yet to receive any official order/memorandum from the Agriculture department regarding the recall.“We will not hesitate to comply with orders, and we’ll not contradict other regulatory agencies. But for this one, we have to clarify with them because no memo has reached my office yet. For now, we will continue with the status quo,” Faeldon said.He assured importers that there will be no port congestion and undue delay in the release of their shipment so as not to compromise the supply of and demand for meat in time for the holidays.As of end November, Pinol said, the DA had already validated some 4,000 import permits.",1
"Current Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo’s public relations team or, shall we say, propaganda machine is working overtime. They found an opportunity to try and put her image in a good light after President Rodrigo Duterte decided to skip the 119th commemoration of Philippine Independence Day. Photos of her in salute pose during the recent ceremony have been circulating the Net with her supporters gushing and so impressed by her appearance. Even if Robredo is just standing and taking part in a ceremonial duty, her supporters are simply the kind of people who get taken by appearances no matter how shallow.Robredo’s supporters seem to have taken the cue from the President’s staunch critic Senator Antonio Trillanes who lambasted Duterte for not attending the rites and who even went as far as saying that Duterte lacks discipline. That’s rich coming from a convicted mutineer. The senator’s own lack of discipline was evident when he mounted a coup d’état against former President Gloria Arroyo in 2003. He certainly knows how to break the rules.Duterte’s critics – most of whom are actually Robredo’s supporters — are scraping the bottom of the barrel. Now they are saying Duterte couldn’t even be bothered to wake up early to commemorate the country’s Independence Day. As if Duterte not attending the ceremony is going to cause the Philippine economy to collapse or foment something more catastrophic.It was in the news that he was consoling the relatives of the fallen soldiers whose bodies arrived from Marawi City the night before the Independence Day commemoration. Photos of the President being emotional and hugging the relatives were shown on various news outlets. Immediately afterwards, it was also reported that he proceeded to the Philippine Marines headquarters at Fort Bonifacio to visit the wake of two of the slain Marines whose remains were flown earlier. Duterte obviously had a very rough and emotional night consoling grieving families. It is not surprising that he decided to skip the early morning ceremony the next day.Duterte’s critics are hoping that highlighting the President’s absence would work towards knocking down his popularity. Unfortunately, Duterte’s supporters know and understand why he was away. They are actually glad that he rested instead of attending the Independence Day rites. In other words, criticising Duterte for skipping the yearly event was a futile attempt to bring him down.Lately, Duterte’s critics have taken up this habit of highlighting the times he is absent from important events. They have become very desperate, nitpicking just about anything he does. This is part of the reason why they do not have credibility. They have taken a leaf from what happened to former President BS Aquino in 2015 when he was severely-criticised after he decided to skip the welcome honours for the bodies of the fallen Special Action Force (SAF) officers of the Philippine National Police at Villamor Airbase and chose instead to attend a Mitsubishi plant inauguration held on the same day. Because BS Aquino’s popularity suffered after that event, Duterte’s critics are trying hard to copy that phenomenon and now anticipate that it could work to bring Duterte down too.Despite knowing where Duterte was the night before, his critics still speculate on why he was absent from the Independence Day rites. It’s as if his critics have lost all sense of reality and prefer to believe their own fabricated stories. One critic speculated that he’s just too lazy and couldn’t be bothered getting up early. Another one said Duterte is just not patriotic enough. They are mistaking attending ceremonial duties to actual work. Besides, Filipinos can’t even agree on what date the Philippines actually became independent. Some say it should be commemorated on the 4th July because it was on that date in 1946 when the Americans actually granted the country its independence. In other words, this new date – the 12th of June – is an artificial construct. Some Filipinos just decided that it should be the country’s Independence Day since it was the date we supposedly won our independence from the Spaniards in 1898. But this date doesn’t acknowledge the fact that the country was colonised by the Americans afterwards. Meaning, Filipinos were not truly “independent” until the 4th of July 1946.As a matter of fact, the Philippines is not yet independent in the true sense of the word. Filipinos still rely on other countries to help when the country is in trouble especially when the country is hit by devastating typhoons. A lot of Filipinos also expect that the Americans will come to their rescue if ever a foreign invasion happens. There are even Filipinos who were disappointed that the United States did not help scare China away from occupying the disputed islands in the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Recently, the news that members of the US military have been helping the Philippine military with “technical” aspects in the battle against the Maute terrorist group in Marawi City does not even surprise most Filipinos. It’s generally accepted that the US is always around to help out. This arrangement is something most “independent” nations don’t have. In the Philippines, it’s normal.Indeed, the concept of “independence” or being independent is something most Filipinos do not seem to understand. The Philippines is far from being independent. The fact that thousands of Filipinos are forced to go overseas for work and livelihood is already proof of this. The fact that we have to rely on the generosity of other countries for aid to sustain the country’s needs means the annual Independence Day commemorations ranks right up there with having Robredo as Vice President – all for show, but lacking in substance. Perhaps Duterte was right in skipping it all along.",0
"Who can forget Leni Robredo’s bold suggestion to preserve the ruins of the terrorist siege on Marawi City? The Vice President’s brilliant idea was met with both praise and criticism.But now, Robredo is criticizing the government of Japan for its offer to help the Philippines rebuild war-torn Marawi.The offer was made during President Rodrigo Duterte’s second official visit to Japan.In a statement issued exclusively to Rappler, Inquirer, ABS-CBN, GMA 7 and The Adobo Chronicles, Robredo lamented the fact that foreign governments like Japan are interfering with the internal affairs of the Philippines.”We are independent and we should have the exclusive right to determine what’s best for our country and people,” Robredo said.",0

"The scale of destruction caused by super-typhoon Yolanda in 2013 awakened Filipinos and the world to the consequence of inaction and divisiveness on climate change. Seven million individuals were affected by disaster, more than 5 million jobs were lost, and more than 4 million people were displaced. Billions of pesos were needed for medical aid and rebuilding efforts, and death counts unbearable even for a country visited annually by 20 storms. All these pointed to the stark truth that our planet is under threat.That year, the Philippines topped the Global Climate Risk Index’s list of countries most vulnerable to weather-related disasters. The storm’s aftermath revealed more complex realities borne of disasters. Blocked roads and bridges limited the access to food rations from outside, supplies dipped, and hunger rose in affected communities. Children’s groups shared fears for the wellbeing of those left orphan by the storm and living in relocation sites.The country’s economy was not spared. Yolanda ripped power lines from as far as Laguna and Zamboanga del Sur to the hardest-hit areas like Leyte, Samar, and Bohol. Disconnected from the national grid, agricultural and service-oriented industries were paralyzed for months. The National Economic and Development Authority registered inflation rates as high as 6% and a 1.6% rise in poverty incidence which set poverty levels at 47.3% in Leyte.Geography has always put a known risk on the country. Its archipelagic nature leave parcels of land open to the battering of strong currents, but a more worrying phenomenon has risen since. The Philippine Exposure Map on Climate Change, drafted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, detailed the dwindling sources of water for the upper regions, while provinces in the Visayas and Mindanao face the combined threat of “extreme heat and rising sea levels.”To mitigate the risks that come with climate change and global warming, the Philippines pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 70% and encourage the shift from coal to more sustainable sources of energy. The accord achieved during the 2015 United Nation’s Climate Change Conference in Paris, is scheduled to take effect this November.A year after, discussions on the Paris agreement and its effectivity and scope are still on the table. The commitment to reduce the national emission is being contested, but vital areas like climate justice is making its way to the mainstream discourse. In May, 2016, typhoon victims filed a case against carbon-emitters, a landmark case for human rights related to climate.People are taking action, refusing the dim future that looms on the horizon. They are becoming more conscientious in their use of energy and carbon footprint. Many are exploring transportation options like carpooling and demanding cities to reserve spaces for bike lanes. Even industrial designs are reflecting this predisposition to cleaner, more earth-friendly buildings, as well as energy-saving machines.More forums are being hosted, among them Climate Reality Project’s sponsorship of top climate change advocate Al Gore. Climate Reality Project, a global multi-sectoral alliance, enjoins more Filipinos in its cause for the environment.",1
"According to some pundits, President Rodrigo Duterte is waging not just a “war on drugs” in the streets of major Philippine cities. He is, they insist, also waging a war on social media, commanding an “Internet army” that disseminates content supposedly meant to discredit his enemies.Are these assertions based on fact?For one thing, that other lament of the Opposition, the eruption of a spate of “extrajudicial killings” perpetrated by forces supposedly inspired by Duterte’s “encouraging words” against “drug personalities” has also gained limited popularity but remains starved of factual bases. Reporting homicides on the morning paper is one thing. Proving these are state-sanctioned or “extrajudicial” in nature is another. So far, the Opposition has been unable to prove the latter beyond reasonable doubt. A murder prosecution (much more a conviction), after all, demands stringent standards of quality in the evidence presented by the accuser.That track record of issuing shrieky assertions seems to have extended to the fantasy of this “Internet army” Duterte supposedly commands. From my vantage point, to be fair, clever memes and cutting-edge blogs have been churned out clarifying some matters in a manner not particularly flattering to Duterte’s detractors. And I’ve seen Duterte’s detractors and other prominent members of the Opposition reduced to calling for those who publish that content to just shut the f–k up. That call of last resort likely describes the profound frustration of an Opposition in disarray — whose most prominent thought leaders find themselves overwhelmed by the edge, sharp wit, and unmatched prolificacy of this imagined “internet army”.Unfortunately for the Opposition, the administration of former President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III still casts a long shadow of dysfunction across Philippine society with much of the legacies of his mismanagement still felt by a struggling general public. As such, the irony of how the Opposition camp continues to make it easy for such content to be produced and disseminated to willing consumers seems to escape those who can do no more than gnash their teeth in frustration.More importantly, none in the Opposition have put up any credible and broadly-organised challenge to this fantastic “Internet army”. It is like China’s annexation of South China Sea territory all over again. Rather than put up a good fight, the Opposition have been reduced to pathetic and incessant whining about the “unfairness” of it all. Rather than respond with an equal and opposite force, the Opposition, instead, choose to withdraw into their cloistered communities of like-minded mutual-highfivin’ amigas to assure themselves that they continue to be the prayerful “good guys” while all the rest are the “bad guys”.The Opposition needs to man up, take stock, and get a grip. Put up a real fight rather than continue delivering that long drawn-out whine we’ve been seeing and hearing for months.This is, after all, the Internet age and, more specifically, the age of social media. This is the landscape that once-credible “social media experts” trumpeted as the age of the “free market of ideas” — where a free flow and exchange of ideas and concepts are subject to the corrective forces of a level battlefield with each side applying critical thinking faculties to evaluate what is valuable and what is rubbish. This is an age that was supposed to have heralded the rise of a more informed citizenry and, out of that, a smarter electorate.Then again, maybe it did just that and what we are seeing today may, in fact, be that smarter choice now in power and at work. Who’s to say, after all, that Duterte was the wrong choice? For that matter, who’s to say that there even is such an “Internet army”? By what authority do those who say so say so?There is no evidence.Evidently, some of these erstwhile prophets of free-market information brokering seem to now be backpedalling on their earlier pronouncements — that social media is now being used as a tool to misinform rather than inform. That is quite a presumptuous assertion to make. The big assumption underlying all that whining about this supposedly “misinformed” public is the idea that the Internet is being co-opted by Duterte’s sinister forces to bend people’s minds to their nefarious will. Perhaps. But the simpler explanation is likely to be more confronting — that the Opposition, quite simply, failed to step up to the occasion and put up a credible and organised challenge.",0
" A 3-year-old girl had been sitting quietly in a hospital bed for about 30 hours with a fractured arm, one of the 44 survivors of the horrific bus crash on a mountain road in Nueva Ecija this week.The staff at Veterans Regional Hospital (VRH) in Bayombong had no way to identify her so they posted her photo on social media in hopes that relatives would recognize her and come forward.On Wednesday afternoon, the girl’s grandmother informed the hospital that her father had also survived the crash and was being treated at Nueva Vizcaya Provincial Hospital, also in Bayombong.“The little girl caught everyone’s attention because people started calling her an angel for surviving the fall,” said a hospital staff who declined to give his name. “It was a relief to learn her father was alive and that they would be reunited soon.”Death toll now 35The girl’s predicament highlighted the daunting task of identifying the victims of the Leomarick Trans bus crash, whose death toll had risen to 35 on Wednesday.So far, police and health workers have identified only 10 of the dead, including bus driver Rolando Mangaoang and conductor Cesar Perang.It was one of the deadliest road accidents in Northern Luzon in the last five years. (See In the Know) The crash was so violent it tore off the roof of the bus and flung the passengers out of the vehicle even before the twisted wreck hit the bottom of the ravine.The number of dead and injured indicated the bus carried over 70 passengers, more than its allowed maximum of 45, said Ernesto Corpuz Jr. of the franchise monitoring office of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in Central Luzon.The overloaded bus was negotiating the Maharlika Highway-Cagayan Valley Road after leaving Isabela province for Candon City in Ilocos Sur province when it struck a road barrier and fell into the 24-meter ravine around 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday in Barangay Capintalan in Carranglan.“It was a miracle,” said passenger Ralph Grajo of his survival.The Nueva Vizcaya resident, who was treated at VRH, said he had sensed something was wrong when the bus suddenly accelerated.He said the driver had alerted the passengers that the brakes were not working moments before the bus veered off the road.Grajo also said one of the front wheels blew up as Mangaoang tried to stop the bus by driving toward houses along the road. The vehicle instead struck a barrier and then plunged into the ravine, he said.As the bus careened down the road, the passengers were screaming in horror, rousing Ruby Ann Senis from her nap. Senis, her 7-year-old child and her sister survived with cuts and bruises.30-day suspensionCorpuz said the LTFRB slapped a 30-day suspension on Leomarick Trans, owned by Leonardo Patulot, pending results of an investigation.Patulot, in a radio interview, offered support and compensation to the passengers.In Manila, lawmakers called for an investigation of the crash while expressing condolences to the families of the victims.Quezon City Rep. Alfred Vargas said a law should be passed to keep old and malfunctioning buses off the roads and urged the LTFRB to take punitive actions against the bus company.“Our authorities in the transportation sector must once and for all act stronger against buses that are not roadworthy. These coffins with wheels must no longer be allowed to take passengers,” Vargas said.A thorough investigation was needed, said Sen. Grace Poe, “so that those who are at fault could be held liable and the victims be given justice.”The crash reinforced the need to create a National Transport Safety Board that would conduct independent probes of accidents and formulate policies and programs to ensure safe travels, she said.The 47-kilometer stretch from San Jose City in Nueva Ecija to Dalton Pass of this mountain highway is a busy route. Dalton Pass, where the Sierra Madre and Caraballo Sur mountain ranges meet, serves as the gateway to Cagayan Valley and the rice terraces of Ifugao.After the July 1990 earthquake that rocked Northern Luzon, mudslides became a problem in many portions of the highway during the rainy season. The maintenance engineering office of the Department of Public Works and Highways explained that the shaking had loosened the soil on top of the denuded mountains.",1
"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) have started bracing for the “Undas” season (All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day) in the country.All Saints’ Day is marked every November 1 and All Souls’ Day, every November 2.On those two days, Filipinos visit the graves of their dearly departed.LTFRB spokesman Aileen Lizada on Wednesday said the agency has already received 420 special permit applications from 1,043 buses for the “Undas” season from companies plying routes in Northern Luzon, Southern Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao.In a text message, Lizada said they will inspect bus terminals on Monday.During the inspection, she added, transportation units and terminal facilities will be checked to ensure that buses are safe and convenient for passengers.“Enforcers and employees will also be deployed to terminals in Pasay City, Cubao [in Quezon City] and Sampaloc [in Manila] to extend passenger support and hear their complaints and queries,” Lizada said.Coinciding with the inspection, the board said, is the launch of “Oplan Isnabero,” an annual campaign that urges to public to report complaints against taxi drivers who violate safety rules and refuse to transport passengers.A standee will be placed at taxi bays in malls where commuters can fill out forms containing reports against the taxi drivers.Lizada said the LTFRB will issue a show-cause order against non-compliant terminals and units.At the country’s premier Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) airport authorities and concerned agencies are also getting ready for implementation of “Oplan Undas” on Friday.Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) General Manager Ed Monreal said help desks, additional police personnel, doctors and nurses and staff from the Public Affairs Division will assist passengers with their flight schedules and information especially domestic flights.He added that all terminal managers and assistant managers are expected to perform their regular functions even during the days declared as holidays.These managers are expected to address the needs of passengers, monitor possible traffic congestion and ensure the safety of the public, according to Monreal.To avoid such congestion, check-in counters for domestic flights will open two hours before departure and three hours for international flights because of an expected increased volume of passengers this week.with BENJIE L.

"House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas on Tuesday said the tax exemption of cooperatives would be retained, a looming victory for those who opposed its repeal in House Bill No. 5636 or the Tax Reform Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN), the tax reform package of the Duterte administration.Fariñas told reporters that Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez III “has granted the request of cooperatives” not to remove the value-added tax (VAT) exemption granted by the National Internal Revenue Code to cooperatives. This provision has yet to be discussed at plenary.The VAT exemption stays “with some amendments acceptable to all concerned,” Fariñas said. The amendments mentioned by the House leader have yet to be released at press time.The proposed removal of the 12-percent VAT exemption of cooperatives is one of the more contentious issues in the Duterte administration’s tax reform package.Members of various cooperatives have attended the House plenary for the past two days to urge lawmakers to retain the exemption in the proposed tax reform package.The 47-strong party-list coalition has also called for the retention of the VAT exemption of cooperatives.Ifugao Rep. Teddy Baguilat, an opposition lawmaker, said some 150 congressmen had also expressed support for the retention of the VAT exemption of cooperatives.Coop-Natcco Rep. Anthony Bravo immediately took the floor to interpellate the bill’s sponsor, Quirino Rep. Dakila Cua, on the proposed repeal of the VAT exemption of cooperatives. Cua chairs the House ways and means committee.Bravo said removing the VAT exemption privilege would result in “stifling the development of cooperatives and denying them the benefits” under the National Internal Revenue Code.Bravo added that the removal of the VAT exemption would be tantamount to a violation of the Constitution, which provides for the development of social enterprises.But Cua replied that the “intention” of TRAIN “is also to raise revenue intended to subsidize many programs, including those of cooperatives.”“We want them to grow and be an integral part of the local economy and therefore there is more than one way to do such. It is not only by tax incentives but more effectively subsidies and programs to empower cooperatives,” Cua said.The House of Representatives began tackling in plenary session the tax reform package amid criticisms that the bill was full of promises but short on specifics that would ensure its smooth implementation once enacted into law.“It’s not unknown to us here in Congress that our tax system is complicated and has many loopholes. Let us change it. The ways and means committee studied the bill thoroughly for the development of the Philippines and our countrymen,” Cua said in a brief sponsorship speech.Nueva Ecija Rep. Estrellita Suansing, in her sponsorship speech, called for the imposition of a P10 tax on sugar-sweetened beverage, which would increase by 4 percent every year.Suansing urged her colleagues to view this new tax imposition as a “health measure.”Sugar-sweetened beverages include soft drinks, nonalcoholic flavored, carbonated and noncarbonated beverages, fruit drinks, sports and energy drinks, and sweetened tea and coffee.Motherhood statementsAlbay Rep. Edcel Lagman said there was no question that the government needed the additional revenue for infrastructure projects and socioeconomic programs, but lamented that the tax reform package contained only “motherhood statements.”“There is nothing specific [that] would give us a definitive insight on what is going to happen,” Lagman said.He called on the House leadership not to pass the tax reform package “with undue haste,” adding that approving the bill before Congress adjourns on June 2 would deprive congressmen of a “deliberative and exhaustive consideration of a very important tax measure.”Lagman said he would oppose the bill in “its current form” but would support it if he saw the specific provisions that would clearly define how the tax reform package would be implemented.For example, he said he would want to see a specific provision on the “linkage between the incremental revenues and the expenditures” earmarked for infrastructure, transportation, health, education and social protection.The promise of a social benefits card for the vulnerable sector in the bill is not enough as well, Lagman said.“We could not possibly extrapolate the benefits from these vague conditions. Who are qualified? That is not answered. How much would be given? That is not answered. What is the frequency of the disbursement? That is not there [in the bill],” he said.Lagman said the bill stated that “not more than” 40 percent of the revenue from excise tax on petroleum products would go to the proposed social benefits card meant to cushion the impact of the resulting higher prices of commodities.But he said the implementing rules and regulation of the proposed law could actually “go down to the lowest level.”Lagman said even the additional P10 excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages appeared to be antipoor because soft drinks were among the few “luxuries” of the underprivileged.In a separate press conference, Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao said antipoverty measures like the social benefit card were vulnerable to corruption and abuse.",1
"if we the people stand united and unleash all that power that is in our hands.”Iowa voters learned that another 2020 prospect, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, was canceling a weekend appearance in the leadoff presidential caucus state to attend a demonstration at a refugee tent city along the U.S-Mexico border.In an interview, Castro said Trump’s new order is a valid remedy only if children are immediately and humanely reunited with their parents. Republicans have no hope of retaining the congressional majority this fall, Castro predicted, should they continue to adopt restrictive immigration measures.“The president may be signing an executive order backing down, which he never does, because he’s offended our sense of morality,” Castro said. “He’s crossed a line, whether he realizes he’s crossed it or not.”Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran for president in 2016 and may do so again, lashed out at the Trump administration’s family separation policy as a “human rights violation” that’s doing lasting damage to the families involved. He suggested that only the “very naive” would believe that Trump’s executive order had completely resolved the problem.Sanders said several Trump Cabinet members should step down in general, including Nielsen. He doesn’t blame her for the latest controversy, however.“The issue right now is President Trump,” Sanders said. “It’s not her. Trump makes the decision.”California Sen. Kamala Harris, who called earlier this week for Nielsen’s resignation, plans to visit a San Diego detention facility Friday and meet privately with mothers who have been separated from their children.“This executive order in no way deals with reuniting the (asterisk)two thousand three hundred(asterisk) children who have been torn away from their parents and remain separated,” she wrote on Twitter. “When will they see their parents again? They must be reunited immediately.”In a conference call with reporters, liberal activists promised to begin running ads in key House races that would highlight audio recordings of crying immigrant children being mocked by immigration officials. They also raised a series of new questions for the Trump administration, including whether White House policy director Stephen Miller, who helped design the family-separation policy, would be disciplined.“The public outrage and grassroots fury about families being ripped apart has blown past even the health care fight. I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Ben Wikler of the group MoveOn. “These fights tend to shift the underlying political ground.”",1
"Okay, I know I’ve already established myself clearly as an opponent against a Mar Roxas presidency but now, it’s time to move on to another candidate to bash. Granted, I really hate Mar Roxas for his association with the Aquino family but Grace Poe has earned quite a bit of suspicion due to a good number of factors which I will discuss here. Truth be told even, I have some suspicion that she could very well be an alternate candidate should Mar Roxas lose the election which is now more than likely considering how much ire he and his party has earned from the people of the Philippines.Her DisloyaltyNow before I begin, I’m going to say that I don’t have anything against Americans. I was raised by an American and yes, a lot of my good friends in my gaming community are Americans. However, after telling them about Grace Poe, they tell me not to put my trust in people like Grace Poe.Her sudden change of citizenship just for the convenience of it should ring some kind of alarm in some people because its telling of what kind of personality she really has. Unlike the many OFWs who are slaving away in other countries, Grace Poe is already the daughter of a rich and famous action star. Her residence in the United States was done out of convenience and comfort rather than necessity.However now that it seems like she can make a name for herself as a president in the Philippines, she wishes to once again become a true-blue Filipina. Indeed, her claim that her stay in America was a “sacrifice” almost feels like an insult to Filipinos who travel to the United States just to make sure their kids eat three meals a day even if it means having to scrub toilets and worse.Let me make it clear to you: Grace Poe never sacrificed anything for the Filipino people when she lived in the United States and she will probably return there should she lose this year’s election.Her Lack Of SubstanceAnother sad fact about Grace Poe is that her biggest bet in the presidential election is that her father died. Truth be told, while her father did make some memorable movies, I don’t think that’s a qualification for being president. This isn’t all that different from President Aquino’s reason for running (and winning) in the 2010 election or Leni Robredo using her husband’s death to get voted into vice presidency.Indeed, whenever Grace Poe says “I will continue what my father started!”, I want to ask her what did her father start asides from starring in a film where he was a heroic blacksmith.Her NaiveteDuring the presidential debate, I remember Mayor Duterte asking her about how she would handle the troubles of the West Philippine Sea. Like a typical beauty pageant contestant, Grace Poe replied that she would seek out diplomatic solutions among our Southeast Asian neighbors.The problem here is that, as history has proven over the years, diplomacy can only go so far. While I don’t like the idea of an open war with China, if we continue to just be passive-aggressive in our efforts to regain our lost territories, then we might as well say goodbye to our islands in the West Philippine Sea. Grace Poe has forgotten the reality that not everything is negotiable and not everyone is willing to negotiate.",0
"Retired nurse Alta Alfiche was singing “What a Beautiful Morning” despite being drenched by heavy rain while waiting outside the gate of Pope Francis Center for the Poor in Palo town, Leyte province, on Saturday.Alfiche, 78, who flew from California to Tacloban City to see Pope Francis, had been lining up for more than two hours under pelting rain brought by Tropical Storm “Amang” (international name: Mekkhala).A pilgrim registered in Zone A, Palo, Alfiche said she had been outside the gate since 5:30 a.m.Security was tight and she endured the rain with hundreds of others, including infants and elderly people, who were also waiting at the gate.Presidential Security Group personnel were painstakingly slow in checking the names on the IDs against their lists.But no one left.To ward off the cold, Alfiche began to sing: Oh what a beautiful mornin’Oh what a beautiful dayI’ve got a beautiful feelingEverything’s going my wayOh what a beautiful day.People around her, who were also wet, were amused.No regretsAlfiche told the Inquirer that she didn’t regret coming to Palo despite the rain because she wanted to see the Pope.“It is why we are here,” she said.Liezel Sorilla was carrying her 14-month-old daughter, Maria Katrina Leizel, in the rain.“She is used to the rain,” said Sorilla, of Arado village in Palo, whose family survived Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan). That’s the reason why the child didn’t cry despite getting wet. Sorilla said she had to bring the child because she had to breastfeed her. With Sorilla were her husband and two other daughters aged 10 and 8.Sorilla said the whole family wanted to see the Pope and be blessed after surviving Yolanda, whose 250-kilometers-per-hour winds generated 7-meter storm surges, flattened entire communities, killed more than 6,300 people, and left thousands missing on Nov. 8, 2013.At 7:30 a.m., the gates were thrown open and Alfiche, the Sorillas and the rest went in to wait for the arrival of the Pope.Francis had planned to see for himself the devastation left by Yolanda, but the approach of Amang accelerated the papal Mass at the airport and the remainder of the program—a visit to Palo for a meeting with the local clergy, lunch with the typhoon survivors, and the blessing of the center for the poor named after the Pontiff—was compacted so he could leave four hours early and avoid worse weather.Vatican’s decisionInterior Secretary Mar Roxas said it was Vatican officials who decided to cut short the Pope’s visit to Tacloban and Palo.Roxas said Amang was forecast to make landfall in Borongan City, Eastern Samar, just hours before the Pope’s original schedule to fly back to Manila.The return flight was accelerated by four hours to prevent the Pope and his delegation from being stranded in Tacloban, Roxas said.“The events in Leyte had to be shortened to allow the Pope to return to Manila much earlier not because of security threat, but as adjustment to the weather,” Roxas told reporters in Manila.He said the government simply implemented the changes made by Vatican officials.Disappointment in PaloPressed for time, the papal motorcade sped to Palo, but with Francis, wearing his yellow plastic raincoat, acknowledging the greetings and cheers from the multitude that had lined the road since early morning waiting to see him despite the beating rain.Soon after arriving at the Palo Cathedral, Francis took the microphone and told a surprised crowd that he would have to leave at 1 p.m., four hours ahead of schedule.“I apologize to all of you,” he said, speaking in Italian through a translator. “I am sad about this, truly saddened, because I had something prepared especially for you.”Some of the priests, nuns and others in the cathedral groaned, though mostly in a good-humored way.Instead of addressing the local clergy, Francis led them in praying the “Hail Mary” then proceeded outside to bless the center for the poor named after him.Alfiche, the Sorillas and the rest of the Palo folk were disappointed when told by Fr. Manuel Baybay, the event organizer, that the Pope would not be able to meet them because of his shortened schedule.Baybay told them, however, that the Pontiff blessed the center and to lift their spirits, he cheered, “Viva il Papa!”“Viva!” the crowd of about 2,000 responded.Built by Cor Unum, the Vatican aid agency, the Pope Francis Center for the Poor aims to help orphans and elderly people.The Vatican’s spokesperson, Fr. Federico Lombardi, said the Pope made an unprogrammed visit to the house of a local family. He talked with the family and blessed them before leaving, Lombardi said.The unscheduled visit followed Friday’s surprise visit of Francis to a shelter for homeless children in Manila after celebrating Mass at the Manila Cathedral.In Palo, after a quick exchange of gifts with the local church leaders, in which Francis received a wood image of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception made from the debris from the typhoon-damaged cathedral, the Pope’s motorcade sped to the airport in Tacloban for the flight back to Manila.The papal plane made the flight back to Manila safely.Although the Pope cut short his visit to Leyte, many were pleased.Sister Gemma Abunda Silvero of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart said she was moved by the Pontiff’s visit.A former Augustinian Recollect sister, Silvero, 74, said her homegrown congregation was involved in the ministry for poor people.She said that although her order got canonical approval from the late Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin, its apostolate was focused on Eastern Visayas, where some of the Philippines’ poorest provinces are located.Silvero said her order lost all of its schools during Yolanda, and was trying to rebuild them.A nephew, television talk show host Boy Abunda, is helping raise funds for the rebuilding, she said.Silvero said that although the Pope’s visit was brief, it was a moral booster.“We continue to have faith in God,” she said.Saturday’s storm, which was expected to make landfall on nearby island province of Samar in the late afternoon with winds of 100 kph to 130 kph, was an eerie reminder of Yolanda, but it did not stop Francis from traveling to Tacloban. But it forced him to leave Manila early and abbreviate his visit with the typhoon survivors to four hours, from the planned seven hours.The Philippine Airlines Airbus A320 carrying the Pontiff took off from Villamor Air Base in Pasay City at 7:35 a.m., ahead of the originally planned departure at 8:15 a.m.The plane arrived at Tacloban airport an hour later, and Francis, donning a yellow, translucent plastic raincoat, plunged in his popemobile into the wet but festive crowd that had built up overnight to welcome him.“Viva il Papa (Long live the Pope),” the people chanted as Francis rode to the open field near the airport where he was to say Mass for the victims and survivors of Yolanda.A police official estimated the crowd at the airport at 150,000 and said tens of thousands more were lined up outside the airport and along the route of the Pope’s motorcade to Palo.Tacloban had a population of about 200,000 before Yolanda.Climate change encyclicalFrancis’ trip to ground zero was to have given him the opportunity to speak about climate change ahead the release of his encyclical on the environment.The Pope said the encyclical was almost finished and that he hoped it would be published in June, ahead of the UN climate talks in Paris in November.Francis waded into the climate change debate on Thursday, telling reporters on the plane to Manila that he believed that man was primarily responsible for it and that he hoped this year’s UN climate meeting would take a courageous stand to protect the environment.“I don’t know if it is all [man’s fault] but the majority is. For the most part, it is man who continuously slaps down nature,” he said. With reports from Niña P. Calleja and Marlon Ramos in Manila; Lito B. Zulueta in Tacloban; Nestor P.

"The Commission on Audit (COA) on Monday bade goodbye to its first woman chair, Grace Pulido-Tan, who considered the institutional reforms she introduced to weed out “misfits” in the agency among her greatest accomplishments during her four-year stint.But Tan, who was named by President Aquino to head the COA in April 2011, would perhaps be best remembered for leading the special audit of the Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF) of lawmakers that led to the detention of three senators and the filing of criminal charges against other government officials and private individuals.A lawyer and a certified public accountant, Tan served the unexpired seven-year term of Reynaldo Villar, who resigned in February 2011 following the controversy over his appointment by then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2008.Farewell speechIn a farewell speech at the flag-raising ceremony at the COA headquarters in Quezon City, she thanked COA employees in helping her improve the credibility of the commission.Along with Justice Secretary Leila de Lima and Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales, Tan was recently named by the Inquirer “Filipino of the Year” for 2014. The newspaper called them the “3 Furies.”“You are the real Commission on Audit, you who have made COA your life career and calling, and have sworn to serve with utmost dedication and faithfulness,” Tan told the employees of the constitutional commission tasked with looking into the financial transactions of all public offices.“Let it therefore be also your pride and fulfillment. As such, make it so. Its future is in your hands and minds and hearts. Chairpersons and even commissioners will come and go… But the mandate and independence of the commission are etched in the Constitution and will remain so until our people say otherwise,” she said.Tan said the cooperation of COA personnel made it possible for her to make the commission a more professional organization and “a truly independent COA” despite its limited resources.IntegrityShe said the agency could proudly claim that its goal to make the COA personnel “a truly efficient, dedicated and faithful workforce,” which valued “integrity as a way of life,” was “no longer just dreams or aspirations. We have made them possible in very concrete and palpable ways.”She said that she would be leaving the COA after “three years and 290 days” with “joy and fulfillment” and that she was happy to be “able to do what I told you then we would [do] together.”Gems discovered“We asked our own ranks to account for their lapses and outright misconduct, and did not hesitate to impose corresponding disciplinary action,” Tan said.“We ended the culture of political patronage, fellowship and debt of gratitude for self-aggrandizement. I told you to believe in your own qualities and qualifications, not in the endorsements of politicians… With these, we were also able to discover gems of public servants among you, long denied their rightful recognition,” she said.She said the reforms that the COA implemented during her term were instrumental in allowing the agency get a positive 22 rating during a survey of best performing anticorruption agencies by Social Weather Station in 2013, up from positive 8 four years earlier.In 2014, Tan said the COA ranked 12th in the Makati Business Club’s perception of government performance, a big leap from 31st place two years before.CPA, Bright SpotUnder her watch, the commission launched in November 2012 a Citizen Participatory Audit (CPA) that received reports, comments and suggestions from citizens. The participatory audit received great interest from COA counterparts in other countries.Because of the CPA, the COA was chosen on Nov. 1, 2013 the “Bright Spot” at the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Summit in London. The Bright Spots competition recognizes the most inspiring examples of how open and accountable government is changing people’s lives.The OGP is an initiative that seeks “to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, fight corruption and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.”RELATED STORIESGrace Pulido-Tan to bow out in Feb; Palace looking for next COA chiefFilipino of the year: ‘3 Furies’ deceptively simple",1
"The National Bureau of Investigation has a copy of closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage that recorded the actual shooting of former Inquirer correspondent Melinda “Mei” Magsino.“The footage showed that the suspect was waiting for Magsino at a street corner near her rented apartment,” Calabarzon NBI head Constantino Joson said.He said Magsino could be seen in the CCTV as she emerged from her rented apartment and how she was shot in the nape by a gunman whose face was not covered.Joson said that at this time they could still not establish the motive of the killing but he said what is certain was the killer was a hired gun.Joson said the personal belongings of Magsino were given to the NBI by her family.He said the NBI had interviewed witnesses of the shooting but most of them declined to give an official statement.Forensic examinationJoson said Magsino’s family maintained that she was killed because of her exposés on alleged irregularities in the local government of Bauan town in Batangas rather than the love triangle angle being floated by people who could have something to do with her death.The NBI has started the forensic examination of the cell phone and laptop of Magsino, according to the bureau’s computer division head.“We are retrieving deleted messages and calls for investigators to analyze the data,” NBI-Cybercrime head agent Ronald Aguto Jr. told the Inquirer.Aguto said that based on the contents of the cell phone and the laptop, investigators could determine who could be the mastermind of the journalist’s death.“It would give investigators an idea of her activities that could provide leads,” Aguto said.Recto’s initiativeAt the Senate, Sen. Ralph Recto on Wednesday urged the government to create a fund for information that would lead to the capture of the killers of Magsino, adding that he was donating P100,000 to the fund.Recto, who is married to Batangas Gov. Vilma Santos, joined those who had condemned Magsino’s killing and called on law enforcers to immediately bring justice for her death. The government should also end the impunity surrounding the killings of journalists, he said.Magsino, 40, was shot dead a few meters from her apartment in Batangas City on Monday.Police are looking at several possible motives for the killing.According to Recto, Magsino was gutsy and “gave Batangueños an image of what a crusading and courageous journalist should be.”Sharp as ‘balisong’“As a member of the press, Mei practiced her craft with guts and grit, her prose and insight as sharp as a balisong (fan knife), which she used to peel the falsehoods that hid the truth, and prick the conscience of the people and the ego of the powerful,” the senator said in a statement.He said that even if Magsino was no longer with a media organization, this had not stopped her from social commentary. Her words brought about the change that she wanted to see in her province, he added.“She died with her boots on, ‘comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable’ to the end, and it was her desire to search for and speak out the truth that led her enemies to cowardly censor her forever,” he said.Recto also said Magsino’s killing should not be one of those cases in which journalists were killed for reporting the truth.She was the 32nd journalist killed in the country under the Aquino administration, and the 173rd journalist slain since 1986.RELATED STORIESNBI looks at love angle in ex-reporter Magsino murderEx-PDI reporter spoke of threat to her life 2 years ago, says friend",1
"Was it a simple case of misreading an official data, or an intentional political overture against her political rivals just to score points against them?Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos on Tuesday said she thinks that it was politics that took the better of Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, whom she chided for doing the math wrongly in a recent engagement in the United Kingdom.Marcos corrected Robredo, who portrayed several provinces as among those in the Top 20 poorest provinces in her speech at the London School of Economics last Friday.Citing a so-called recent study by Ronald Mendoza, the dean of the Ateneo School of Government, Robredo said10 provinces with the highest dynastic share in the 2016 elections have consistently ranked in the Top 20 poorest provinces since 2004.These provinces, according to the Vice President, are Maguindanao, Sulu and Lanao del Sur in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao; Batangas and Rizal in Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon); Pampanga, Bulacan and Nueva Ecija in Central Luzon; and Pangasinan and Ilocos Norte in Ilocos Region.She even made the conclusion that these provinces are poor because of the existence of political dynasties.But Marcos quickly pointed out that Ilocos Norte is “definitely not among the Top 20 poorest provinces” in the Philippines, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).“She [Robredo] can easily check her data with experts, especially government agencies like the National Economic and Development Authority or the [PSA] if she wants a more accurate reading on the state of poverty in the provinces,” the governor said.“For the record, Ilocos Norte has been one of the provinces with the lowest poverty incidence estimates in the past decade and was not one among the Top 20 poorest provinces, “ Marcos added.Official PSA data shows that Ilocos Norte has 13.7 percent poverty incidence estimate in 2006, 11.1 percent in 2009, 8.4 percent in 2012 and 3.3 percent in 2015.The Ilocos Norte provincial government recently said it achieved a 16.7 percent economic growth in 2013-2014 compared to the 5.72 percent regional growth and 6.13 percent on a national level.Ilocos Norte significantly decreased its unemployment rate from 37 percent in 2010 to 4.2 percent today, it added.Marcos said the province is now one of the few provinces to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the poverty rate.Also, official records from the Ilocos Norte tourism office put at more than 1.6 million the number of local and foreign tourists who visited the province in 2015 compared to the 259,148 recorded in 2012.Marcos said Robredo already visited Ilocos Norte twice with her children in tow, “so I guess she should have observed the developments in the province and the lives of the people.”",1
"The Philippine National Police chief turned gun-shy on Monday about running for the Senate in 2019, after the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) poll showed him nowhere in the Top 12.Fielding questions from reporters during a news conference at PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa declined to talk about politics, saying he was focused on his job during the three-month extension of his term as PNP chief.“For now, I will just work. We need to focus on work because if you say that I will run, all my decision making would be described as political, that Bato’s brain is just about politics, that he only wants to look good,” Dela Rosa said when asked about his fall from the ranks of potential winners in the 2019 Senate race.“It will ruin my plans and strategy [for the PNP], that’s why I won’t comment (about his senatorial plans). I will work the best way I can help the President bring about reforms,” he added.The SWS poll, taken from Dec. 8 to 16, showed Senators Grace Poe, Cynthia Villar, Nancy Binay, JV Ejercito and Sonny Angara, Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte and former Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. among voters’ Top 12 picks for the Senate in the 2019 midterm elections.Top 20Dela Rosa was ranked 10-12 in the SWS November survey. But he fell from that spot in the December poll, although he remained in the Top 20, according to SWS.The PNP chief said he would be grateful if he would be considered for the Senate—presumably by President Duterte’s party, PDP-Laban—but added that he “should not consider this very seriously because I might be lured toward saying that I am eyeing [a Senate seat].”Pressed further and asked what would be his platform should he decide to run, Dela Rosa said: “I will answer that in due time if I need to answer that question.”",1
"Philippine army’s commanding general, Lieutenant General Rolando Joselito Bautista on Friday pledged full support to the people of Lanao del Sur until completion of Marawi rehabilitation.Bautista said there will be no trials that cannot be conquered in a united society, thus he said Marawi and the Maranaos will rise again.“Nawa’y ang ating pagkakaisa at pagtutulungan ay manaig at magbukas sa pintuan ng tunay na kapayapaan” Bautista said.He stated that the augmentation forces was been added fast-track the rehabilitation of Marawi.The pronouncement came after he formally accepted the honor to become an adopted son of Shakba Ko Lawasaig in a thanksgiving program held at the Multi-purpose complex here, July 6.Bautista in his acceptance message said he was deeply honored and proud of being an adopted son. “Sa araw na ito taos puso at malugod kung tinatanggap ang karangalang maging isang anak ng Shakba ng Lanao. Ito ay aking ipinagmalaki bilang isang sundalo at isang Pilipino”.He said this acknowledgement is profound as this means you have open your doors so to accept and embrace me as your family.“Mula sa aking puso, maraming-maraming salamat po sa inyo sa pagkakikilala at sa kandoring (Kandori-thanskgiving) inyong isinagawa para sa inyong lingkod”.Assemblyman Zia Alonto Adiong said the sultan of Ditsaan and sultan of Ramain along with the provincial government of Lanao del Sur chose the venue here in the heart of Shakba ko Lawasaig.Because this area symbolizes the old maranaw politic, the center of power which provides authority to the two institutions surviving for more than 300 years, said Adiong.These two institution were actually the titular head of one of the sovereign states of the four principalities of Ranaw, the Mala A Bayabao, he said.Having said that Lieutenant general Rolando Joselito Bautista is now of noble blood and heritage.Butig mayor Atty. Dimnatang Pansar said the occasion is just part of their expressed gratitude to the armed forces of the Philippines on their efforts to crushed out the Maute group during the marawi siege.Bautista was considered a military hero considering the goodness he has done to the maranao people. “Honoring a military hero, hindi matutumbasan ang kanyang ginawa na kabutihan sa mga maranao”, Dimnatang said.Meanwhile, Bautista also acknowledged and expressed gratitude to the Tarlac Heritage Foundation founder Doña Isabel Cojuangco Suntay and her daughter Dr. Isa C. Suntay for the help they extended to the internally displaced persons caused by the Marawi crisis through a temporary shelters called Bahay Pag-asa which were built in barangays Buadi Itowa and Mipaga in Marawi City.“Ganyan nila kamahal ang mga kapatid na taga-Mindanao lalung-lalo na po ang kapatid nating mga maranaw”. he said.",1
"Under a drizzle, 1st Lt. Sarah Jane Bagasol patiently waited for the signal man for clearance to drop the 4.5-kilogram shell she was holding into the 81-millimeter mortar.She got it and seconds later there was a loud explosion.The spotter, on an elevated position, radioed a direct hit on the target—a house some 800 meters away, where Maute gunmen had taken shelter that day.Bagasol, 26, is one of seven female soldiers in the Army’s 1st Infantry Battalion, which was plucked out of Luzon on June 1 to fight the Maute group and its allies in Marawi.One of their tasks is to provide indirect combat support during special operations, such as taking down an enemy lair.Education graduateBeing an Army soldier was farthest from her mind though she completed the Reserve Officers Training Course (ROTC), Bagasol told the Inquirer.She obtained an education degree from the state-run University of Southern Mindanao in Kabacan, North Cotabato province.She passed the licensure examination for teachers, hoping to land a permanent teaching position in a public school.“I wanted to have a stable job. Then my former ROTC commandant told me that I should probably try entering the Army. He told me that soldiery is the noblest profession and, in jest, added that there is no capital involved in it except your life,” she said.When she failed to get a plantilla position even after several months of teaching in a public school, Bagasol followed her former commandant’s advice. She applied with the Army’s 2nd Infantry Division based in Tanay, Rizal province.First combat experienceBagasol was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the 1st Infantry Battalion, then based in Infanta, Quezon province.In her sixth year of soldiering, her entire battalion was sent to Marawi on June 1.Like Bagasol, Pvt. Anjanette Mayang, 23, gives indirect combat support as a gunner, handling 81-mm and the smaller 60-mm mortars, and joins battle operations.Barely into her first year in service, Mayang, a native of Laguna province, said the Marawi crisis was her first actual combat experience.“I took ROTC while in college and decided to be formally drafted into the Army. I graduated with a criminology degree in 2016 and applied to the 2nd Infantry Division,” she said.Mayang, the eldest in a brood of eight, said her father, a security guard, and her mother told her they were proud of what she was doing here.Fighting with menShe also draws strength from the plight of women and children who fled Marawi and are now in evacuation centers. “They also serve as my inspiration to continue fighting even with the risk of enemy fire hitting me,” she said.When they were not at their mortar posts, the female soldiers join their male comrades in actual combat and exchange fire with the enemies.“I also get nervous, but this is combat. What the male soldiers experience, we also get to experience,” Bagasol said.In combat, she said, men and women are in the same boat. “We fight during wars and we serve in other ways when there is peace.”Mayang said her being a woman had not hindered her from performing her job. While she is happy to serve, it saddens her to learn that women are also fighting on the side of the Maute group.Reports about female Maute snipers first surfaced during the early days of the fighting.Target of snipers“Recently, we have also become the target of enemy snipers. We were conducting mortar fire along with our battalion commander (Lt. Col. Christopher Tampus) and we were targeted,” Bagasol recounted.Pantao Ragat Mayor Lacson Lantud, whose half-brother Hata is among the terrorists, said his sibling had told him about having female fighters there.“They’re fighting for a lost cause,” Mayang said. “My message to them is to return to the fold of the law and not add to the suffering of the people.”Bagasol said she did not regret her decision to become a soldier.“I was shaped into a better person, who is capable of doing things beyond what was thought of me. I am now a more critical thinker, more optimistic, more responsible and tough,” she said.Model for youthsShe said she was able to meet and befriend many people, and had helped more because of her job. “It also feels great to know that many people, especially the youth, are now looking up to me as their model.”Being in the Army also made her experience how to help the needy, especially during medical and dental missions, relief operations, Army-led, gift-giving activities and feeding operations.“That’s why even if I am far from my family, I did not lack love and care because of people I have helped,” Bagasol said.“My sworn job, serving the people, securing the land,” she said.",1
"SOME overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Sydney, Australia are not pleased with how politicians and groups not allied with the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte try to project the image of the Philippines to the international community and they made sure minority Sen. Risa Hontiveros got the message.In her recent meeting with the Filipino community held at the Philippine Consulate Office in Sydney, which was posted on the Internet, Hontiveros was asked by an OFW on how they can help improve the image of the Philippines when there are people including the senator who keep on trying to malign the country before the world.The OFW, who identified herself as Luwalhati, particularly cited Hontivero’s recent demand on Duterte for him to allow the United Nations to come to the Philippines and investigate reported unexplained killings in the country.She was referring to a recent statement of Hontiveros urging the Duterte administration to invite representatives of the UN and the European Union to verify allegations of extrajudicial killings in the country.“Where is the honor in that? How can we be honorable when we malign our own community, our own people and suggesting that there are crimes going on done by the government against its own people?” Luwalhati asked Hontiveros.She said it is unfair for OFWs all over the world who are doing their best to help change the image of Filipinos and the Philippines before the international community and yet there are elected officials like her who continuously try to bring the country down.“We are the ones who are directly affected. We are in the frontline and we have to put up with that,” Luwalhati added.“You’re a senator so people will listen to you whether we like it or not, so how can we change the image [of the Philippines] if there are people who keep on destroying it,” she said.Hontiveros reacted by saying she only urged the government to invite representatives from the United Nations to visit the country and investigate, not demand they they be allowed to enter the Philipines.She added that figures on drug-related deaths were based on data of the Philippine National Police wherein 60 percent of deaths were from legitimate police operations while 40 percent were considered deaths under investigation (DUI).Hontiveros, part of the Senate minority bloc, explained that she made the call for the government to invite the UN representatives because of earlier claims of the Duterte administration that the international community had been misled on the real score in the war on drugs.“So that was the spirit of my statement urging government [to issue an invitation] and with all due respect also I’m not maligning [the government], it’s an attempt as a legislator to call the attention of the executive,” she pointed out.She said as a member of a separate and co-equal branch of the government, it is her duty to point out things that may need correction or gap that may need filling by the executive.",1
"Supermarket shoppers won’t see three popular items on the shelves the next time they go grocery shopping.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has totally banned the sale of wine, rice and Mac n Cheese following reports that these have been tainted with health hazards.Both wine and rice have been reported to contain dangerous levels or arsenic, the chemical that is present in poison. Mac n Cheese, on the other hand, has been found to contain metal scraps and had to be recalled by its manufacturer.“We know this would be upsetting to many American consumers because of the enormous popularity of these items,” an FDA spokesman said.“However, there are many alternatives that are available to consumers,” the spokesman added. “These include quinoa as substitute for rice, beer as substitute for wine, and Chinese noodles (chow mein) as substitute for Mac n Cheese.”The FDA asked consumers to be patient as it conducts a thorough investigation of the tainted items.",0
"A climate change expert from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said there was a need for local and national government agencies to be proactive in seeking funding for climate-adaptive projects.Ancha Srinivasan, ADB principal climate change specialist, said local government units (LGUs) in the country were not proactive enough in asking for funding for projects.According to the ADB expert, there are at least $6 billion in funds available for climate adaptation measures that are not being fully utilized due to the lack of requests from LGUs and even the national government.Srinivasan noted that this was noted “in areas where there are floods, not only because of rain but because of the poor management of risks.”The ADB official said communities were not aware they could tap resources even within the government’s purse, such as the People’s Survival Fund.The Local Government Code and other national laws such as the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Law, meanwhile, allow for the building of infrastructure for climate change adaptation measures.Donations to Philippine projects barely reached $50 million, the official said.By default, local governments are mandated to prepare their Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP), Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP), and the Local Climate Change Action Plan (LCCAP), among others.The LCCAP, for one, requires the participation of all barangays as it is within the localities of the barangay officials.Oftentimes, agencies such as Davao City’s Central 911 and the barangay’s local disaster committee are at odds, especially during disasters with decisions such as evacuations and rescue planning.",1
"The lawyer of suspected pork barrel queen Janet Lim-Napoles announced that her client has agreed to a plea bargain in the criminal case filed against her by accepting a penalty of “community service,” in order to avoid jail time.Along with top congressional leaders, Napoles was charged with plunder in a 10-billion peso pork barrel scam in which taxpayer funds were funneled into bogus non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and into the personal accounts of Napoles and top legislators and government officials.Attorney Lorna Kapunan told The Adobo Chronicles that Napoles has agreed to perform community service for life instead of rotting in jail for her crime.Asked about what kind of community service would be involved, Kapunan said that her client will serve as a housemaid for Dominga Cadelina, Napoles’ former househelp who was jailed last February for alleged qualified theft filed against her by Napoles.Cadelina was recently ordered released from jail by the Makati City Regional Trial Court for lack of merit on the theft case filed against her.This unprecedented plea bargain is the first known such case in which, in Kapunan’s words, “the master and servant roles are totally reversed.",0
"The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) has started its own due diligence and vetting of three Chinese contractors submitted by China to the Department of Finance for the P18.75-billion Kaliwa dam project, one of President Duterte’s flagship water security projects.MWSS Administrator Reynaldo Velasco said this was in compliance with the directive of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III for “MWSS to conduct its own due diligence in vetting the said Chinese companies/contractors subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations.”In a letter to Dominguez last September, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua submitted the three shortlisted Chinese contractors and companies namely, China Engineering Co.

Ltd.Velasco met earlier with Chinese Commercial Counselor Jin Yuan who accompanied representatives of the three Chinese companies to present their credentials to the MWSS Technical Working Group.In a letter to the MWSS chief, Dominguez underscored the need to immediately start the procurement process and undertake limited competitive bidding among the said Chinese companies and contractors [following applicable procedures and documents under Republic Act. No. 9184, or Government Procurement Reform Act.”The Kaliwa dam project, which has a total cost of P18.75 billion, is situated in towns of General Nakar and Infanta in Quezon province. The project involves the construction of a dam with a discharge capacity of 600 million liters per day and a 27.7-kilometer raw water conveyance tunnel with a design capacity of 2.4 million liters per day.According to Velasco, the Chinese government has committed P10.2 billion in official development assistance (ODA) to fund the Kaliwa dam project.Velasco said the financing for the project would now be in the form of ODA loan, instead of a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme.The MWSS is also vigorously pursuing the Laiban dam project, which is three times bigger than the Kaliwa dam, for the overall water security of Metro Manila which sources 95.6 percent of potable water requirements from Angat and Ipo dams.",1

"I have been thinking about this phenomenon of laziness in the Philippines and have wondered what could be the cause or origin of this prevalent attitude and behavior. An idea came to me as a result of spending time on the farm. I noticed in the Philippines, especially in the upland area of Cavite, the soil is rich and fertile due to its volcanic nature (synthetic fertilizer is not needed, and instead damages the soil). What I found most interesting is how easy it is for plants to grow! I can stick about any plant or seed in the ground (as long as they can handle the climate) and it grows! Amazing! It’s effortless planting. The ideal combination of temperature, soil and humidity is conducive to plant growth and fruit bearing.The question is what was life like in the Philippines pre-colonial days? The population was significantly smaller (1 million or less?). Life was simpler. Natural resources were abundant. Perhaps when hungry, one simply picked fruit from trees or speared fish in shallow waters. There was no shortage of food. There was no reason to store. Food was plentiful.Perhaps, as the picture above depicts, one could just lay under a tree with mouth wide open to catch falling fruits (not advisable under coconut trees). Could this scenario be the origin as to why there is a dominant lazy attitude in the culture — a remnant behavior from the distant past and from a culture and environment that no longer exists?…just my thoughts.This is a GRP Featured Comment. --------------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"Jesus Is Lord church founder Bro.

Despite that support, Villanueva slammed in 2017 the alleged extrajudicial killings in the government’s war on drugs, but put the blame on “police scalawags.”This time, the firebrand Christian leader had much to say about the President’s “stupid God” remark, which he said was tantamount to “blasphemy in the highest order.”The President’s animosity toward the Church is nothing new, as he has repeatedly recounted being sexually molested by a Catholic priest when he was in high school.He also previously cursed the Pope publicly for causing traffic when he visited Manila.",1

But females undergo a more serious matter that their male counterparts don't have to go through: the menstruation period.When going through this monthly period, women have a number of important precautions to consider. For example, you can't do as much active work as you regularly do without period.

She feeds them at least twice a day.Farming and raising livestock are the major sources of livelihood in this mountainour area. Women also make colorful beaded jewelry and tend their loom to produce handwoven textiles.Although Apo Whang-ud doesn’t have a family of her own, she takes care of other relatives and is actually very motherly. She is usually in her kitchen cooking using firewood.When tourists come for their tattoos after more than 12 hours travel by bus, jeepney and habal-habal (motorized bike), they find that there are no hotels, only homestays with the locals.Staying in Apo Whang-ud’s house means sleeping on handwoven mats on the floor and gazing up on portraits of this cultural icon that were sent her by previous visitors.After finishing her chores, the old woman takes a break by playing a nose flute in the silong (basement) of her house. For some reason, she loves playing sad music.Visitors to the area are well-advised that Apo Whang-ud and the people of her tribe do not speak English or Filipino, so it would be best to get a guide from Tabuk or Buscalan who speaks their Kalinga dialect.There’s also spotty cellphone signal in the area, but there’s postcard-pretty scenery so keep your phones and cameras charged and ready to shoot.Since the area is quite remote, the Apo and her Butbut tribe would really appreciate some treats from guests. A box or two of matches would make the elders happy, while the children would love some candies or chocolates.",1
"‘is giving dim prospects for Cha-Cha.Davao City 1st Rep. Karlo Nograles, one of the House members who facilitated Arroyo’s rise to the Speakership, said earlier this week that the Senate didn’t want to cooperate.“They don’t want to constitute the Constitute Assembly (proposed by Arroyo). The Speaker herself has already made the decision that we cannot move to shift to a federal form of government without the participation of the Senate,” Nograles was quoted as saying.“We pretty much gave up on it,” added the House Appropriations Committee chairman.",1
"1%In reporting the survey results, the COMELEC noted that Filipinos who suggested the pig were convinced that it best represents the pork barrel scam that has rocked the country and the political system in recent years. The crocodile, according to its proponents, represents the greed that seems to be a consistent characteristic of most politicians and government officials. As far as the mermaid is concerned, the COMELEC said Filipinos thought it best represents the marine and fisheries industry that is the prime source of livelihood for majority of the population. Observers, however, think that the choice of the mermaid was prompted by a new television series on the mythical creature that is about to make its debut in the Philippines. The TV series is titled “Dyesebel.”",0
"PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte is reconsidering the lifting of his veto on temporary suspension of the use of express lane charges collected by the Bureau of Immigration (BI) in reaction to a letter of appeal from the bureau’s rank-and-file.“It has been referred by Malacañang to the Department of Budget and Management [DBM] for further study and consideration,” BI spokesman Antonette Mangrobang told The Manila Times.Express lane charges are additional costs being paid by a foreigner who wants to fast- track processing of his documents.They are used as a source of funding to pay for the services of the bureau’s confidential agents, contractual employees and other job orders and for overtime pay.According to Mangrobang, lower salary grade employees were the most affected by the presidential veto on the use of the express lane charges, particularly those receiving less than the minimum wage.“There are immigration employees whose salary grade level is only P9,000 a month, which is below the minimum wage,” she said. “Their morale is low.”As a consequence of the President’s veto, immigration employees were no longer paid for overtime work as payments collected from the express lane charges were remitted to the National Treasury.Sources said many employees have already resigned, further depleting the BI’s manpower, while others who opted to remain were either always absent or going under time.Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre 2nd of the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a letter to the President, pointed out that the elimination of express lane fees has serious implications in the delivery of the BI’s mandate.“The deposit of express lane charges to the general fund will automatically result inthe displacement about 1,000 or 73 percent of the bureau’s workforce by next week. The only source of income of these BI personnel is the express lane fees. Without the express lane fees, they will automatically lose their jobs and will join the unemployed population of the country, ” the letter of appeal said.At present, the BI has 2,671 personnel composed of 1,696 organic/permanent, presidential appointees, and 975 confidential agents, job orders and computer personnel.It supposedly needs at least 4,000 workers.The employment of 63 personnel ends when the term of the incumbent commissioner expires.The BI is in danger of losing 81 percent of the remaining personnel because of a meager net pay of about P6,000 to P13,000 for 24/7 duties.Use of express charges collected by the bureau is allowed under the DOJ-BI Special Provision No. 3, which is based on Section 7-A of Commonwealth Act 613 or the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940.The BI fears a collapse or paralysis of its operations anytime, which may compromise national security as a result of the veto that barred the agency from using its income for operational purposes.",1
