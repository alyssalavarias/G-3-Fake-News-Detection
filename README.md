# G-3-Fake-News-Detection
**Limitations**
<br> The news content from the learning datasets is primarily composed of specific classifications of news. As such, news tested for legitimacy using this prototype should also be under the same classifications for optimal results. The top 4 largest classifications for the news are: (1) Current Affairs, (2) Politics & Government, (3) International News, (4) Entertainment & Lifestyle.<br>
**Warning:**
<br> Running the code from the start will randomize the raw dataset again, which means that results may vary significantly from our presented results. To get results closer to ours, run the code cells that will load the attached csv files for the processed dataset and testing dataset instead.
