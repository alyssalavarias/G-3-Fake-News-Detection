"To be competitive, Filipino seafarers must be highly skilled and computer savvy, according to the Maritime Industry Authority (Marina).Marina Administrator Marcial Quirico Amaro 3rd stated this during the launching of the 10-year Maritime Industry Development Program (MIDP) Program at the SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City last week. Amaro said the country needs to produce more computer literate seafarers and port workers because of changing technology in ship management.“We want to be able to produce doable and sustainable programs coming from all stakeholders in the industry to be able to produce highly qualified seafarers. We also want to create a robust shipbuilding industry, a dynamic shipping hub and sustainable fishing sector to make the Philippines a major maritime country not just in Asia but the world,” Amaro said during the event that was held in partnership with the SM Global Pinoy.He said it was the first time in decades that the Department of Transportation through Marina is formulating a 10-year development plan for the entire maritime industry, which includes manpower training and development, regulations, shipyard, local and overseas shipping and fishing.The Marina head pointed out that while the Philippines is an archipelagic country, it has not maximized itsstrategic location in Asia to become a major maritime and seafaring nation. He pointed out that there are many challenges in the maritime industry, especially with respect to development of seafarers and port workers.He said there is a need to retool seamen on the latest technology to keep their competitiveness in the world market. “We are still among the leading providers of seafarers in the world but many countries are studying to be equally competitive if not more competitive and are ready to take our place if we fail to cope with the changing times. They are just waiting to lose our competitiveness,” Marcial added.Filipino seafarers contribute around P270 billion a year to the Philippine economy. Currently there is a shortage of 16,500 merchant marine officers . The figure is expected to increase to 92,000 in 2020 and balloon to 147,000 in 2025 from increasing demand.In order to address the need for more highly qualified workers for shipboard assignments and shore-based jobs, Amaro said Marina is set to take over the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP), the government’s training center for the maritime industry located in Tacloban City, Leyte.He said NMP, currently under the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), should not be competing with the private sector in training maritime workers but should instead be a tool to make existing workers more competitive for the local and international market.",1
"I've seen Pinoys in Britain over-react, because of simple misunderstanding of British comedy. Being able to take a joke is important, to fitting in and adapting to a country like Britain (or any Anglo country). It's something older Filipinos seem to miss, but that does not mean they are not pilloried by comedians. I much prefer a Filipino comic to insult Filipino culture, because there is a context. It's so hard to miss when you are describing another culture.In 2013, when asked ""unlikely lines from a cosmetics commercial"", comic Katherine Ryan replied ""We don't test any of our products on animals. We use Filipino Children"".It was obviously not intended as an insult towards Filipino children, but I had trouble with her bitter retaliation over the misunderstood, but badly judged joke, in her 2017 special.She used a stereotypical Chinese accent to pillory Filipinos, and said that the ghost of Joan Rivers told her that Filipinos are ""as bad at understanding satire as they are at running away from tsunamis"". Why did she have to hide behind the spectre of Joan Rivers to further insult people who did nothing to her to begin with?It's easy to mock a minority who have no voice in Britain, and can't respond through the platform of a comedy special. You will NEVER ever hear a British comedian mock Jamaicans or Indians in this manner, even though both those countries have child slave labour, because comedians like Ryan are cowards. They will claim that they don't single anyone out, and say things about all races, but this is BS. It's a very rare, and brave comedian, who will mock all races equally.Maybe it's hard to understand why it is not hilarious to attack children living in poverty, making clothes for people like Katherine Ryan, who gladly defends her cruelty towards animals because its ""not illegal, just frowned upon"".A bit like racism.She may claim, that she was attacking cosmetic companies. Fair enough, but she invalidates that argument when she doubles down on a bigoted remark. She is a comedian, in multicultural London, and she has no idea what Filipino's sound like? They don't have Chinese accents. It's just sloppy to assign a Chinese accent to Filipinos, (this in itself, is a racist caricature).I get that the irony was sadly missed by Filipinos. But she chose to just lash out at a group that in her calculation, and in the calculation of many white British people, is OK to be bigoted towards. Just don't make fun of Jamaicans, Africans, Indians, Pakistani's, and other former subjects of the British empire. It's open season on every other ethnic group.She could have said that Filipinos can no more outrun a tsunami than the Irish can flee from a bottle of whiskey?You're an immigrant Katherine Ryan, but you have adopted a nasty British vice - insulting immigrants, while simultaneously forgetting that you yourself are one.--------------------------------------This is a GRP Featured Commment.

"Netizen Dan Jimenez posted a special report made by authors hiding in pseudonym ‘Dimasalang’, ‘Mulawin’ and ‘Judea’ on how the Filipino journalist and foreign correspondents allegedly earned money by making up stories to discredit the war on drugs of the current administration.According to the unpublished book written by an unnamed reporter from Reuters, payment inside fat envoloes were delivered to the journalists who wrote the most discrediting stories about President Rodrigo Duterte.Media outlets who picked up the discrediting stories with unsubstantiated claims allegedly received $50,000 (PHP 2,500,000) from the people who funded the destabilization against President Duterte.A whistleblower journalist who claimed that he cannot live with the lies and deceit anymore revealed some of the informations about the alleged payments received by media outlets to discredit the current administration.Unnamed source also said that the people who funded the discrediting stories about President Duterte’s War On Drugs are likely the people who will benefitted by the failure of the current administration.He also revealed the news organizations,allegedly involved in the orchestrated move to discredit the war on drugs of President Duterte.The source cited four international media companies and two media companies based in the Philippines these are the list:Time Magazine (International)The Washington Post (International)The New York Times (International)The Daily Mail (International)The Inquirer (Local)ABS-CBN (Local)This are the full post wrote by Dan Jimenez:Special Report: Journalists describe lie rewards, made up crime stories in Duterte’s drug war By Dimasalang, Mulawin & Judea Philippine Journalists and foreign correspondents have received cash payments for making up stories and reporting unsubstantiated claims to discredit Duterte’s war on drugs. Detailed in a yet unpublished book written by an unnamed Reuters’ reporter, payments in fat envelopes were delivered almost like clockwork to those who wrote the most outrageous claims. False stories that are picked up by main media outlets and syndicated shows mete the most money to the tune of $50,000 per story at least. The whistle blower journalist confessed that he could not live with the lies and the deceit anymore and that truth which he had sworn to uphold became the first casualty in Duterte’s war on drugs. How prevalent is the payola? Our unnamed source confirmed that there are a lot more money to be had and that news organizations are dipping like crazy into the pot. He cited the competition provided by social media as one of traditional media’s killer, thus the impetus to look for another source of income. Asked who are the financiers in the effort to discredit the war on drugs, he categorically stated, those who will profit from its failure. And that the drug killings attributed to Duterte are the best arguments to oust him whether such can be proven or not. Asked to name the news organizations involved in the orchestrated move to discredit the drug war, he cited Reuters, Time Magazine, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Daily Mail, The Inquirer and ABS-CBN. Attempts to get reactions from the said media outlets remain unanswered as of this writing.Since President Duterte started it’s bloody war on drugs, he was already bombarded by criticisms and negative stories from several media outlets.Supporters of President Duterte attacked the media outlets and accused of being paid by drug lords to write stories against the war on drugs.President Duterte itself criticized two media outlets for writing ‘unfair stories’ about his actions against criminals.",0
"The Philippine Constitution Association (Philconsa) has urged the Supreme Court (SC) to intervene in an apparent feud between the House of Representatives and the Court of Appeals (CA) over the continuing detention of six employees of the Ilocos Norte provincial government.In a statement, Philconsa over the weekend asked the SC to “defend, preserve and protect the Constitution,” particularly by urging the High Court to act on a letter of three CA justices seeking an advisory opinion on the “unexpected, unorthodox reaction” of the House leadership after the appellate court issued a writ of habeas corpus in favor of the “Ilocos 6” and ordered their release on bail.Philconsa chairman Manuel Lazaro and president Ferdinand Martin Romualdez called on the SC to resolve the CA justice’s letter as an administrative matter and issue a decision to settle the conflict.“This is the judicial process/vehicle to enable the Supreme Court [to] resolve the clashing postures, in order to avert a constitutional crisis,” Philconsa explained.It said the SC is mandated under the Constitution to act “as the final arbiter of constitutional questions/legal controversies.”The SC has a duty to “interpret and allocate the jurisdictional boundaries of the rights and obligations of the parties involved when a writ of habeas corpus is issued,” Philconsa added.It maintained that the House is duty-bound to abide by whatever decision the SC will render on the matter.“In the remote event the House still refuses to honor and execute the resolution/decision of the Supreme Court in the administrative matter, the President shall undoubtedly execute or implement the decision of the Supreme Court, as mandated by his oath of office to preserve and defend the Constitution and execute its laws,” Philconsa said.The “Ilocos Six” have been detained since May 29 at the Batasang Pambansa in Quezon City for their alleged refusal to shed light on the reported misuse of P66.45 million in tobacco levy funds to buy vehicles under the watch of Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos.Through their counsel, former Solicitor General Estelito Mendoza, they were able to convince the CA to issue a writ of habeas corpus in their favor and order their release on bail.In response, the House leadership threatened to hold three CA justices in contempt, arguing that their issuance of the cited writ constituted an intrusion into the exclusive power of Congress to conduct investigations in aid of legislation.The CA justices are Associate Justices Stephen Cruz, Edwin Sorongon and Nina Antonio-Valenzuela.The six Ilocos Norte provincial workers are Pedro Agcaoili (Provincial Planning and Development Office chairman); Josephine Calajate (provincial treasurer); Eden Battulayan, Encarnacion Gaor and Genedine Jambaro (Provincial Treasurer’s Office staff); and Evangeline Tabulog (provincial budget officer).",1
"also has punished Russia for its provocations in Ukraine. Voicing the view of many in Europe, May said, “We believe the sanctions should continue.”Vice President Mike Pence was expected to join the call, but not others that Trump planned on Saturday with the leaders of Japan, Germany, France and Australia.Two Republican senators —Arizona’s John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Ohio’s Rob Portman, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee —also warned the White House about easing any punishments on Moscow and they pledged to turn the sanctions into law.“I hope President Trump will put an end to this speculation and reject such a reckless course,” McCain said in a statement. “If he does not, I will work with my colleagues to codify sanctions against Russia into law.”Portman said lifting the sanctions “for any reason other than a change in the behavior that led to those sanctions in the first place would send a dangerous message to a world already questioning the value of American leadership and the credibility of our commitments after eight years of Obama administration policies.”Russia’s security chief, Nikolai Patrushev, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying he had high hopes for the call. “Everything will be positive,” Patrushev said.U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump become president.Obama in late December ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds and expelled 35 diplomats that the United States said were really spies. The new penalties add to existing U.S. sanctions over Russia’s actions in Ukraine, which have damaged Russia’s economy but only limited impact on Putin’s behavior.In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea in Ukraine, drawing widespread condemnation in Europe and the United States and a raft of penalties.McCain has emerged as a frequent critic of Trump among Capitol Hill Republicans. He takes a dim view of trying to reset relations with Moscow and says Trump should remember that Putin is “a murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American national security interests at every turn.”“For our commander in chief to think otherwise would be naive and dangerous,” McCain said.McCain and Portman are part of a bipartisan group of senators who have introduced legislation designed to go beyond the punishments against Russia already levied by Obama and to demonstrate to Trump that forcefully responding to Moscow’s meddling isn’t a partisan issue.The bill would impose mandatory visa bans and freeze the financial assets of anyone who carries out cyberattacks against public or private computer systems and democratic institutions.The legislation also mandates sanctions in Russia’s all-important energy sector and on investments in the development of civil nuclear projects to rebuke Moscow for its provocations in eastern Ukraine and military support for Syrian President Bashar Assad.",1
"The Sandiganbayan’s Fifth Division will start trying in September graft cases filed against former senator Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada and several other individuals in connection with the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) or pork barrel scam.Pretrial of the cases was terminated on Monday as the prosecution and the defense finished marking evidence that they intend to present during trial.The court set the trial on September 4 and every other Monday thereafter.It ordered issuance of the pretrial order, which will be signed by the parties and their lawyers.A pretrial order lists the number of hearing dates, as well as the witnesses to be presented and the issues to be resolved during the trial.Meanwhile, the pretrial of the related plunder case was terminated last month and the court will begin trying this case on June 19.Estrada was charged with plunder along with his former aide Pauline Labayen (at large) as well as Janet Lim-Napoles and John Raymund de Asis.The former senator was charged with graft along with Labayen; Napoles; de Asis; former Department of Budget and Management Undersecretary Mario Relampagos as well as Marilou Bare, Lalaine Paule and Rosario Nuñez, who were DBM employees at the time material to the cases; former National Agribusiness Corp.President Allan Javellana and former Nabcor employees Maria Julie Villaralvo-Johnson, Rhodora Mendoza, Victor Cacal, Maria Ninez Guañizo and Romulo Relevo; former Technology Resource Center Directors General Antonio Ortiz and Dennis Cunanan as well as former TRC employees Francisco Figura, Marivic Jover, Ma.

"Hundreds of unarmed Japanese Americans took over the Longacre Theater beginning midnight today to protest the impending closure of the Broadway Musical Allegiance.The musical will end its run on February 14, after only 37 previews and 113 performances.Allegiance, starring Tony Award-winning actress Lea Salonga and George Takei, tackles the issue of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.The protesters stormed the theater and occupied every seat — every single one of the 1,091 seats.A spokesperson for the protesters said they got the idea from the recent occupation by an armed militia group of the headquarters of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.Neither the New York Police Department nor the Federal Bureau of Investigation has acted on the Broadway occupation, saying they considered it a peaceful protest and definitely not an act of terrorism.The Japanese American protesters said they will continue to occupy the theater until the producers agree to extend the run of the musical indefinitely. “The musical is a once-in-lifetime opportunity for Americans and others to be educated about the internment of our friends and relatives during the war,” they said.The protesters also set up an online crowdsourcing page in order to raise funds to pay for a daily full house at the theater for a long time.In the meantime, the protesters are requesting the public and supporters to send them enough supply of SPAM sushi and sake to keep them nourished during their sit-in protest.",0
"One of the most viral videos this month was uploaded by Ralph Davenz Altea, a netizen who claimed that he and his brother was manhandled by a Pasay cop identified as PO2 Manuel Taytayon during a road rage incident in Malibay Pasay on Wednesday.The video reached hundreds of thousands of reactions and shares from the netizens, but not all of them criticized the cop, instead they defended him because of the provocative actions by the two brothers in the video.A netizen who watched the video claimed that he witnessed the whole incident of the road rage in Pasay and revealed what really happened behind the video recorded and uploaded by Altea on Facebook.Meli, a concerned citizen commented on one of the video reports uploaded by GMA News in their Facebook fanpage said that he witnessed how the ‘boastful’ Altea brothers provoked the old cop.In his comment, Meli said that after the accompanied his girlfriend to Malibay, Pasay, he saw the Altea brothers trying to provoke PO2 Taytayonand trying to bully the old cop to make him more angry.He also said that it’s not true that PO2 Taytayon who’s going to retire next year pointed his gun to the brothers which Ralph Altea claimed in the video.“Nanjan ako non, hinatid ko ang girflriend ko sa Malibay [pasay]. Hindi naman sila tinutukan eh. Mayabang yung magkapatid, pino-provoke nila si manong, binubully para lalong magalit,” Meli said.“Nag video para kunwari sila ang biktima, pero ang totoo sila talaga yung mayayabang. Kung ayaw nyo maniwala, kita naman sa salita sa video, maangas at mayabang talaga.” he added.Meli also narrated how the Altea brothers confronted the car of PO2 Taytayon after the cop honked his car horn to them three times. He said that he witnessed everything even before the Altea brothers used their phone to record the whole incident.The netizen believes that no good cop would point his gun in a crowded place just because of a traffic argument.He said that PO2 Taytayong might got provoked by the Altea brothers because the two shouted at his wife.“Actually madaming tao diyan. Sino namang matinong pulis ang manunutok ng baril sa simpleng pagsaway lang sa kanila? Masikip kasi yung daanan diyan, nung nabusinahan sila, kinatok nila at sinigawan yung nasa loob ng kotse, bumaba si manong kasi misis niya yung nasa part na sinigawan. Di pa naglalabas ng video ang mga bata that time,” Meli said.Meli said that he understand why PO2 Taytayon confronted the Altea brothers, because the Pasay cop only wanted to defend his wife from the people who shouted at her.He also said that when the brothers saw that PO2 Taytayon was armed by a gun, they started to record a video to provoke the Pasay cop.“Normal na galit lang si manong kasi nabastos misis niya, hanggang sa mainis na si manong kasi mayayabang talaga yung magkapatid lalo na yung nagsasalita. Kung makita nila na may naka sukbit na baril, naglabas ng video pero di naman tinutok, inaasar talaga nila, yun lang.” he said.The version of Meli is the same of what PO2 Taytayon told GMA news. In an interview Taytayon said that the brothers knocked at his car window and after he opened it, the two shouted at them and cursed them.We reached Meli and he said that he doesn’t want to be called by the police to ask for his official testimony because he’s ‘busy’“Pagkatok ni sir dito, [car window] ang lakas matapos noong ibinaba ko eh nandito ang asawa ko sabi niya eh.. ano ha? ******!” Taytayon told GMA news.Some netizens reacted on the testimony of Meli, saying that the side of the cop must be heard also.“Hays kawawa si manong” Martha D. Sim said after he read the comment of Meli on Facebook.NCRPO chief Director Oscar Albayalde also confirmed the relief of Police Officer 2 Manuel Taytayon after the road rage incident that went viral on social media.He ordered the Regional Investigation and Detective Management Division (RIDMD) to conduct a thorough and speedy investigation of the case against Taytayon.“Kung mapapatunayan na may paglabag si PO2 Taytayon, ay hindi po mangingimi ang NCRPO na patawan sya ng karampatang parusa,” he said.PART 1:<iframe style=”border: none; overflow: hidden;” src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fralph.davenz%2Fvideos%2F10207687754592068%2F&show_text=0&width=225″ width=”225″ height=”400″ frameborder=”0″ scrolling=”no” allowfullscreen=”allowfullscreen”></iframe>PART 2:<iframe style=”border: none; overflow: hidden;” src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fralph.davenz%2Fvideos%2F10207687755632094%2F&show_text=0&width=225″ width=”225″ height=”400″ frameborder=”0″ scrolling=”no” allowfullscreen=”allowfullscreen”></iframe>PART3:<iframe style=”border: none; overflow: hidden;” src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fralph.davenz%2Fvideos%2F10207687756472115%2F&show_text=0&width=225″ width=”225″ height=”400″ frameborder=”0″ scrolling=”no” allowfullscreen=”allowfullscreen”></iframe>PO2 Taytayon also filed Cyberbullying and Online Libel charges against the two brothers who destroyed his reputation.However, another video taken several months ago showed that PO2 Taytayon confronted a group of cyclists in Mall of Asia.The uploader of the video said that they were threatened by PO2 Taytayon after they violated some rules of the place.",0
"The Office of the Ombudsman has dismissed a graft complaint filed by the Lapanday Foods Corporation (LFC) against Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Secretary Rafael Mariano and Undersecretary Luis Pañgulayan.LFC had also accused the two DAR officials of grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and oppression/grave abuse of authority in the complaint that it filed last month.According to a Notice of Dismissal addressed to the firm, the Office of the Ombudsman said in part, “A resolution on the allegations of the complaint cannot be done by the office without passing upon the issues concerning the validity of the issuances and the writ’s implementation. Stated differently, complainant is indirectly assailing in this complaint the legality of the issuances and the writ’s implementation, which the Office cannot take cognizance of since these issues should be addressed to the proper forum.”“Clearly, complainant is presently seeking reliefs from the Regional Trial Court [RTC] of Davao City through its pending petition for indirect contempt and from the Court of Appeals (8th Division) in its pending petition for certiorari. These are adequate remedies that are available to complainant and which it is indeed currently availing of in the regular courts,” it added.The Office of the Ombudsman thus dismissed the complaint outright “for want of palpable merit and complainant has an adequate remedy in another forum.”LFC alleged in its complaint that Mariano committed graft when he issued a cease and desist order last December which, according to LFC, prohibited it from evicting the members of the Madaum Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association Inc. [Marbai] from their “occupied” areas.The order “gave a stamp of approval to the forcible taking by MarbaiI members of the Sanid area” and “emboldened the Marbai members to chop the bananas of HEARBCO-1, and to destroy the facilities of LFC in the banana plantation,” the firm also alleged.HEARBCO-1 is the Hijo Employees Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative-1.LFC also alleged that Pañgulayan committed graft when he supposedly “publicly announced to the Marbai members on December 19, 2016 that by virtue of the cease and desist order, the Marbai members could already harvest the bananas in the Sanid area and sell them to third parties despite knowing that LFC has the exclusive right to manage the Sanid area and to purchase the Cavendish bananas of HEARBCO-1, pursuant to a final and executory Order of the RTC of Davao City, and that the DAR has no authority to annul a final and executory order of the regular courts.”The firm was referring to a meeting called last December 19 by the Office of the City Mayor of Tagum City between LFC, HEARBCO-1, and Marbai to discuss a possible win-win solution.The 157.5-hectare Sanid area refers to areas in HEARBCO-1’s banana plantation that had suffered deterioration and that were turned over to LFC management for rehabilitation and operation.According to the complaint, LFC is the exclusive buyer of Cavendish bananas produced from the banana plantation.A disease outbreak in 2004 spoiled the bananas in the farm and caused production to drop, which led to the deterioration of the plantation.According to the complaint, the “No Group” members who organized themselves as Marbai in 2012 did not want to honor a compromise agreement between HEARBCO-1 and LFC that was signed in 2011.“In the compromise agreement, the areas of HEARBCO-1’s banana plantation which suffered deterioration were denominated as ‘Poor Areas’ while those which remained in good condition were termed as ‘Good Areas.’The poor areas consisting of 157.5 hectares were turned over to the management of LFC for rehabilitation and operation. This area is called the Sanid Area. LFC likewise advanced the operational requirements of the farm in order to ensure that the farm receives adequate farm inputs and technical support,” LFC said.",1
"Vice President Leni Robredo was dismayed over the deportation of Australian nun Patricia Fox, whom she believed was “more Filipino” from her decades of missionary work in the country.“Nakakalungkot na pinaalis siya dito sa atin. Sabi ko nga, parang mas Pilipino pa siya kaysa sa marami sa atin (It is disappointing that she was deported from our country. In my opinion, she seemed more like a true Filipino than many of us here),” Robredo said in her weekly radio show.Robredo added that she was disappointed with the “political” decision of the government to expel Fox out of the country.“Nakakalungkot na pulitika iyong naging dahilan. Nakakalungkot na iyong pagpahayag ng mga saloobin, parang, kailangan parati mong pagbayaran (It is saddening how politics became the reason behind all this. It is saddening how voicing out one’s opinion against the government has to pay for it all the time),” the Vice President said.Fox left the country on Saturday night and headed back to Australia after months of legal battle with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) that ordered her deportation and downgraded her missionary visa.President Rodrigo Duterte had accused Fox of “meddling with internal politics” from her participation in a series of protests in Mindanao.The 71-year-old nun, who has stayed in the country for 27 years, previously reiterated that participating in assemblies of farmers and workers, who demand for just wages and humane work conditions, are not political activities but moves to help protect the rights of the poor and the needy.Robredo, on the other hand, said that Fox’s departure will likely be temporary.“Parating sa huli, kabutihan ang mananaig. Kaya tingin ko dadating iyong panahon na babalik din si Sister sa atin at ipagpapatuloy iyong misyon niya para tulungan iyong mga Pilipino (In the end, the good always prevails. That is why I think that there will come a time when Sister will come back to us and continue her mission to help the Filipinos),” she said.Rights and labor groups also thanked Fox for her “exemplary service” dedicated to their sectors.“Sister Pat’s exemplary service to the Filipino people through her missionary work among the country’s poor communities cannot be denied. Only those who detest the poor would want [her] out of the Philippines,” Karapatan Alliance for the Advancement of People’s Rights said in a statement.Anakpawis Party-list Rep. Ariel Casilao added that Fox’s advocacy for “a just Filipino society” will continue even after leaving the country.“Definitely this is not the end but rather another chapter of her advocacy for further advancing not only human rights but also needed social reforms for the poor sectors of our country,” he added.",1
"Malacañang on Thursday assailed the camp of Vice President Jejomar Binay anew for allegedly dishing out another lie—that the Palace was responsible for the removal of a mural of the police’s Special Action Force (SAF) 44 from the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA) in Silang, Cavite.Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma told reporters that there is no proof or truth to the allegation that the Office of the President had a hand in moving the mural even as he emphasized the need to “let the public know the truth.”Binay’s office had issued a press release saying the Office of the President was behind the mural’s pullout from the PNPA, where it was initially unveiled.“Chief Supt. Armand Ramolete, the PNPA director, had reported to Philippine Public Safety College president General [Ricardo] de Leon that the subject mural was pulled out from the PNPA by the owner of the Erehwon Center for the Arts which made the art piece,” Coloma said, after the owner had reportedly cited the absence of an appropriate space to store it.Coloma, who also heads the Presidential Communications Operations Office, also disclosed that “a statue honoring the SAF 44 has been put up at the Camp Mariano Castañeda in Silang, Cavite.”Binay’s staff brought the SAF 44 mural to the Cavite State University, where the Vice President delivered his “true” State of the Nation Address (Tsona) on Monday.Binay spokesman Joel Salgado told reporters that the Office of the Vice President now hosts the mural after “someone higher up” ordered the PNPA to put it down.Binay saluted the mural during and after his speech, where he repeatedly lambasted what he described as an inept Aquino administration.The highlight of his Tsona was his roll call of the names of the slain police commandos at the end of his address.Politicizing their heroismSaid Binay in his speech: “In Mamasapano, 44 SAF troopers laid down their lives while many were wounded. But even just for a short time, their heroism was not mentioned in the State of the Nation Address [of the President]. Even a thank you, there’s none. Good for the President’s hair stylist and fashion designer, they were part of the long list of people he thanked.”Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, the administration’s standard-bearer in the 2016 elections, had slammed Binay for politicizing the heroism of the SAF 44.“For five years, [Binay] applauded the administration he’s been part of. Now this? But worst of all, he politicized the heroism of the SAF 44. This is not right,” Roxas said in a text message to reporters.Presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda has repeatedly slammed Binay’s camp for “dishing out lies” about the administration.He dared Binay’s group to “bring it on,” saying that the Vice President and his allies were attacking Aquino because they could not respond to the allegations of corruption and ill-gotten wealth against him.“We have yet to hear a response other than ‘it’s just politics,’” Lacierda said.",1
"at the highest levels of government by the biggest newspaper in London,” Clooney said about the film project.“The pork scandal in the Philippines has the potential of being a film epic because of its magnitude and the number of people, agencies and companies that were involved,” Clooney said.Clooney himself will play the role of Bong Revilla, Jr. It is rumored that TV host and presidential sister Kris Aquino will play the role of businesswoman and pork barrel mastermind Janet Lim Napoles.",0
"DAMAGE to infrastructure and agriculture from Typhoon “Nona” (international name: Melor) has exceeded P2 billion, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).At the same time, the death toll from Nona and Tropical Depression “Onyok,” which battered the country in succession last week, rose to 45 on Sunday, disaster monitoring officials said. But the NDRRMC said only 35 fatalities had been confirmed.Damage to agriculture accounted for 89 percent of the P2,070,034,469.20 in total damage so far.Destroyed agricultural crops and high-value commercial crops were valued at P1,836,065,865.20, and damaged infrastructure, P233,968,604.A total 168,439 houses were either damaged or destroyed in Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol and Eastern Visayas.The NDRRMC also reported that 35 health facilities in Bicol and Eastern Visayas, including three barangay health stations in Northern Samar province, were damaged.

"THE reconstruction of damaged schools in Marawi City will start next month, according to a consultant of the Department of Education.Nonnie Jeruta, who works as a consultant for the department’s disaster risk reduction management service under the office of Undersecretary Alain Pascua, said the reconstruction of schools on ground zero was initially scheduled on June 15, but was moved to next month.On May 23, Education Secretary Leonor Briones and other DepEd officials visited the Amai Pakpak Central School in Marawi City to launch Oplan Balik Eskwela sa Marawi.“We were able to enter the area because we were with Secretary Briones. We can’t go there without the go signal of the military,” Jeruta said.The DepEd said at least 20 schools have to be repaired. Some needs total reconstruction.“Currently ang ginagawa namin ngayon dun nire-recover namin lahat ng mga usable equipment sa schools like armchairs and tables at dinadala namin yan sa mga temporary learning spaces para magamit doon (We have recovered all usable equipment in these schools like armchairs and tables and we brought these to the temporary learning spaces”,” Jeruta added.“Ten schools were totally damaged, and we have three or four schools that need to be repaired,” he added.Jeruta said it will take more than five years to finish the reconstruction of schools in Marawi City.",1
"The caretaker of a Nueva Ecija farm owned by the Catholic priest who survived an ambush last week in Calamba City is now a person of interest, according to police.Investigators are looking for Rocky Bal-ot after the priest, Rey Urmeneta Jr., 64, told them that the caretaker owed him money for farm equipment he sold to him. The priest refused to tell police how much Bal-ot owed him.“This person allegedly wouldn’t pay up. [Urmeneta] believed he was the only one who may have a grudge against him,” Senior Supt. Kirby Kraft, Laguna police director, said on Monday.2 bullet woundsUrmeneta, who is assigned to St. Michael the Archangel Parish in Calamba, was in his car with his secretary when a gunman approached them and shot him twice on June 6.The priest survived two bullet wounds in the arm and back. He requested police investigators more time to recover before giving a statement.Although this serves as the only “lead” the police have so far, Bal-ot is not yet considered a suspect but a person of interest in the case, according to Kraft.“We don’t have evidence yet to back up what [Urmeneta] has so far given us,” he said.‘Sensational’On Monday, the Diocese of San Pablo in Laguna issued a statement condemning the attack.“We call on our authorities to bring to justice those who did such action. We continuously pray for the immediate recovery of Fr. Rey (Urmeneta),” the diocese said.According to the statement, “Urmeneta was not incardinated to the Diocese of San Pablo, but has contributed to the pastoral needs of our faithful by performing his priestly ministry in some parishes in Calamba, Laguna. After his retirement as chaplain in the Military Ordinariate of the Philippines, he opted to reside in Calamba.”Under police guardUrmeneta is staying at a private hotel in Batangas, guarded by four policemen. He had requested twice to be transferred from the hospital in Laguna to Batangas.The police have yet to identify the gunman who was caught on CCTV.Urmeneta, a retired police chaplain who had served in Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) region, hails from Cagayan Valley, according to police sources.",1

" Wait it out. Do not attack. We do not want to kill people.Surprisingly, the words came from President Rodrigo Duterte who, on Friday, asked the military not to rush things in Marawi City lest they endanger the lives of some 300 hostages still being held by the Maute gunmen.Speaking before businessmen during an investment conference in Davao City, the President said he had asked the military not to launch a major offensive against the terrorist group and their allies who were holed up in a mosque inside the war zone in Marawi City.“I said we have to wait it out. I said do not attack. You can fire shots, but if you launch an assault, they’re going to behead people there,” the President said.The lives of the hostages are equally important, Mr. Duterte added. “It’s not important to me if they’re Moro, Christian or Vietnamese. (What’s) important is we do not want to kill people.”It was the government’s “moral duty” to make sure the hostages were alive, even if the war drags on for a year, Mr. Duterte said.“So, even if it’s expensive … if you see someone running, you can open fire. But no assault. That’s 300 lives. If you have to wait there for one year, let us wait for one year,” the President said.The military should also allow food to reach the hostages. “Not bullets. Only food,” Mr. Duterte said. “It’s our moral duty to see to it that they live and that they are fed,” he added.Despite the cautious approach, the President expressed confidence that the gunfight, which has so far killed 99 soldiers, 421 militants and 45 civilians, would end soon.“The fighting in Marawi would soon be over. The one thing that’s stopping us now is the mosque. It’s a big one (and) it has underground tunnels. (It’s) not so much about (the terrorists), but they have 300 hostages,” Mr. Duterte said.The military said targeting Muslims hiding inside the mosque could be costly to them.“If we target them, the Maute group will succeed in convincing people that this fight is against Muslims,” Lt. Col. Jo-ar Herrera, Task Force Marawi spokesperson, said. “It’s against terror,” he clarified.Maranao Army officers said that the Maute group had been twisting facts to pursue its own agenda of widening the gap between Muslims and Christians.In his social media post, Semion Almujaheed, the self-styled propagandist of the Maute group, said those fighting against them were “soldiers of the cross” or members of the “crusader army.”But Capt. Abdullah Mocsana of the Army’s 103rd Infantry Brigade denied this. “We’re not soldiers of the cross as they have been claiming. We are here fighting evil.”He added: “Islam itself means peace and Muslims are peaceful people. When you kill women, children and the defenseless, you are not a Muslim anymore. You have denounced Islam and you become apostate. That’s what they have been doing.”",1
"FOR his failure to explain why he snubbed Wednesday’s inquiry into his alleged unexplained wealth, former Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman Andres Bautista would be issued a subpoena by the Senate to compel him to attend the next public hearing in January 2018.Sen. Francis Escudero, chairman of the Senate Committee on Banks, said the panel would request Senate President Aquilino Pimentel 3rd to issue the subpoena to Bautista.Escudero resumed the public hearing on the reported ill-gotten Wealth of Bautista after Malacañang officially accepted the latter’s resignation and the House of Representatives terminated impeachment proceedings against him.He began on August 23 the investigation of Bautista’s possible violation of the Anti-Money Laundering Act after his estranged wife, Patricia, claimed that the resigned poll chief had amassed around P1 billion in hidden wealth that includes condominium units and cash deposits with the Luzon Development Bank (LDB).Escudero said Bautista, during his chairmanship of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) during the previous Aquino administration, violated Department of Finance’s regulations when he allegedly transferred some PCGG-sequestered assets to the LDB.He would ask the PCGG to issue a waiver to allow the Senate panel probing Bautista’s alleged hidden wealth to scrutinize these sequestered assets deposited with the LDB.Escudero noted that the LDB is not an authorized government depository bank.“It is a big question why Chairman Bautista transferred the accounts of sequestered corporations to a private bank despite regulations which mandate that these must be placed in government depository bank such as the Land Bank [of the Philippines] and DBP [Development Bank of the Philippines].”Escudero said his committee cannot force the LDB to reveal Bautista’s alleged peso and foreign currency accounts there without violating the Bank Secrecy Law.",1

"Anakbayan University of the Philippines-Cebu claimed that the members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines were spying inside the said campus to conduct a surveillance on several student activist.On Tuesday, Anakbayan UP Cebu Facebook page posted a photo of a uniformed soldier, walking beside the highway and the militant group claimed that the soldier entered the campus premises.They said that the soldier disguised of withdrawing money from an automatic teller machine inside the campus and they believed that the soldier entered the university area to gather intelligence about the activities of the students.To prove their accusation, they claimed that a witness saw the soldier withdrawing only 100 pesos at the ATM and quickly left.“Military elements were spotted in UP Cebu this afternoon. In the guise of withdrawing money from the ATM inside the campus, these AFP personnel are shamelessly attempting to conduct a lowkey surveillance on UP students.” Anakbayan UP Cebu Facebook page wrote.“According to witnesses, they withdrew only a hundred pesos and left after riding a police patrol car.” they added.It seems that the militants were already paranoid because the members of Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and New People’s Army (NPA) were already tagged as terrorist by the government.Meanwhile, several netizens ridiculed the claim of the militant group and some said that they’re only inventing a story to destroy the image of the Armed Forces who fought against the NPA terrorists.“If AFP elements do conduct Recon and Surveillance…..they wont be inuniform. You wont even know they are there!” Netizen Adrian Sidras Aifafara said.“And UP CEBU IS STILL GOVERNMENT LAND! THEY ARE MORE THAN ELLIGIBLE TO PASS those areas. They might be checking out the ROTC unit of the university.”“Paranoia spotted. That is why they like to dwell in university campuses and cry harassment in the name of academic freedom.” Cristobal Flores said.These are the other comments of some netizens:Comments by the netizens on the claims of Anakbayan Photo:FacebookThis is not the first time that the militant group accused the army of conducting a surveillance inside U.P campus.Last year, Anakbayan U.P Diliman accused the military of intimidating and spying students after an army truck was spotted inside their campus.However, some netizen said that the military trucks were only passing by on that area.“mga pasista mamamatay tao!” Anakbayan wrote last year.",0
"The stakes were just too much—even for a bold risk-taker who stood to win millions of dollars—to let the opportunity slip away when President Duterte threw a tantrum.The Miss Universe Organization (MUO) had initially canceled the country’s hosting of the 2016 franchise after President Rodrigo Duterte spouted expletives at then US President Barack Obama, according to businessman-politician Luis “Chavit” Singson.At the Meet Inquirer Multimedia forum on Wednesday, Singson also revealed that he could easily pocket $10 million in damages for the cancellation—on top of the $12-million franchise fee that would be returned to him—but he refused to file charges and asked the MUO to reconsider.“It became political,” said the 75-year-old Singson, chair of the LCS Group of Companies, recalling that it was around that time when Mr. Duterte was making fiery speeches distancing himself from the United States and pushing for a stronger relations with regional giant China.In October last year, rumors swirled that the Philippine hosting of the pageant would no longer push through, but this was vehemently denied by the Department of Tourism.PH-US relationsOn Wednesday, Singson said the icy relations between Washington and Manila had affected the MUO, whose owner was the sibling of Obama’s former chief of staff.“I told them that the Philippines already made the full payment [for the franchise] and we signed the contract,” he said.In the following meeting with Tourism Secretary Wanda Teo sometime last October, the MUO announced by speakerphone that it was officially canceling the staging in the Philippines of the 65th Miss Universe pageant.During that conversation, Teo pointed out that the move would be a breach of contract. “They said, ‘We know but the owner canceled it. We’re just employees,’” Singson recounted.Damage suit threatMUO president Paula Shugart also said the MUO owners were aware that Singson could sue for damages but they were still officially canceling the event.“My lawyers were happy because I was to get no less than $10 million and I would also get the $12 million I paid for the franchise without effort. But I showed them that I was not interested in the money. I told them I will not file any damage but they have to reconsider,” he said.Singson said he wrote the MUO management to convince them to push through with the Philippine hosting “because I’ve talked to a lot of corporations and to a lot of people. I’ll lose my credibility and Miss Universe will also lose credibility canceling a signed contract.”Luckily, the MUO changed its mind, also with a little help from some of his Jewish contacts, he said, noting that the MUO owner is Jewish.‘Perfect’ hostingBut by the time the MUO decided to push through with the contract, some of the Philippine sponsors had backed out because “it was too late” and the pageant was beginning mid-January, he said.Overall, Singson spent $15 million to stage what the MUO later described as a “perfect” hosting of the 2016 Miss Universe franchise. The pageant started on Jan. 15 and culminated on Jan. 30 at SM Mall of Asia Arena.On top of this amount, Singson disclosed that he bought 30 new buses for use of the 86 Miss Universe titleholders and a yacht, reportedly amounting to $12 million.The money he plunked down was not a financial loss but rather an investment, he insisted.“As long as tourists will start arriving in the country, it’s a win for all of us. I’m very positive that it will be easy to recover the amount as long as there will be many tourists because I have transportation, an airline and a hotel,” he said.Even when he was notified that the government had nothing to spend for the event, Singson said he pushed through with his bid for the sake of the country.“It’s the biggest promotion the country can ever have with around 200 nations and half a billion viewers watching,” he said.",1

"Focus on the Word of God instead of idle chatter, Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle reminded the Catholic faithful on Ash Wednesday as they began to observe the 40-day penitential season of Lent.Catholics had their foreheads applied with ash during Mass on the first day of Lent as a reminder of human sinfulness and mortality and as a sign of mourning and repentance.The ash came from burned palms, which priests blessed on Palm Sunday last year.Lent, a season of fasting, reflection and prayer, culminates in the commemoration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter.“Sometimes, we give too much time to all kinds of words. These do not come from God, but we give importance to these. We react and respond to words that do not come from God,” Tagle said in his homily during Mass at Arzobispado de Manila.“People listen and respond to incessant idle chatter, but if it’s the Word of God, is there anyone responding? Is there anybody interested?” he said.Misuse of social mediaIn an apparent reference to widespread misuse of social media, Tagle said many people were good only at idle chatter, the only thing they listened to and spread.“But do they cause change in society?” he said.Tagle said he hoped the faithful would use Lent to pray, read and listen intensely to the Word of God.“Do not be ashamed to spread the Word of God. May we find within ourselves that the Word of God is a gift from Him. When I put ashes on your forehead as I say, ‘Repent and believe in the Gospel,’ have a change of heart, be sorry for your sins and have faith in the Word of God,” he said.The cardinal also reminded the faithful that genuine change must start within themselves.“Perhaps our most important contribution to the country and the world today is a change of heart,” Tagle said.“If we do not see that much change in our society, we need to look within ourselves,” he added.Genuine charityTagle also reminded the faithful about genuine charity, which does not call attention to the donor.“One important aspect of change of heart is that it does not focus on oneself. It focuses on God, through his Word, and focuses on others,” he said, as he spoke about an anonymous donor who on Monday fed 3,000 families in the slum community of Parola, in Manila’s Tondo district, who lost their houses in a fire last month.He compared the anonymous donor to people who usually had their photos taken when they made a donation.Tagle reiterated his appeal to the faithul to observe Lent by fasting and by donating the money saved to the feeding program of the Catholic Church.“Once again, we humbly ask you to help us in this undertaking. We appeal to you to support Fast2Feed of Pondo ng Pinoy’s Hapag-Asa program,” he said.Fast2Feed is a project that aims to combat hunger and malnutrition among Filipino children by encouraging people to fast during Lent and to donate the money they save by skipping meals to the program.",1
"The Senate is set to investigate the P15.5-billion Philippine warships deal, amid allegations that Special Assistant to the President Bong Go intervened in the project.The minority bloc filed Senate Resolution 584 on January 16, directing the Senate committee on national defense and security and the congressional oversight committee on the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Act to conduct an inquiry on the status of its implementation, including the acquisition of the two Philippine Navy frigates.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, and Senators Francis Pangilinan, Risa Hontiveros, Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, Antonio Trillanes IV, and Leila de Lima signed the resolution.An Adobo Chronicles nationwide survey shows that almost all Filipinos — a whoppping 99% — support the appearance of Go in the Senate Inquiry.While none of those surveyed think that Go had anything to do with the questionable warships deal, the survey respondents said that they would very much like to hear the voice of Duterte’s “right-hand man.”While Go is always seen in public with the President, very few Filipinos have even heard him speak.’This will perhaps be our only chance to hear him speak,” the respondents said.The big question: is Bong Go a tenor or a baritone?Meanwhile, it has been reported that Trillanes is GOing abroad and won’t be back until February.",0
"Some officials of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), including Solicitor General Jose Calida, were paid honoraria or allowances that exceeded 50 percent of their annual basic salary, the Commission on Audit (CoA) said.According to CoA’s audit report on the OSG for 2017, the excess sums that they received totaled P10.77 million.“The honoraria/allowances paid to some OSG officials for legal services and advices rendered to client agencies had exceeded the fifty percent of the annual basic salary by ₱10,774,283.92 contrary to Item 4 of COA Circular No. 85-25-E dated April 25 1985,” CoA said.According to the audit report, Calida’s allowances exceeded 50 percent of his annual basic salary, or by P7.46 million.The others and the amounts received in excess of 50 percent of their basic salary were: Henry Angeles (P697,039.15), Herman Cimafranca (P62,454), James Cundangan (P448,707.83), Renan Ramos (P837,252), Rex Bernardo Pascual (P9,394), Bernard Hernandez (P136,814.72), Ma.

Section 1(i) of P.D. (Presidential Decree) No. 478 and Section 35(9), Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of E.O. (Executive Order) No. 292, authorize the OSG lawyers to receive allowances and honoraria for the legal services they render without qualification, in addition to their regular compensation.”“The application of COA Circular No. 85-25-E means that not all client agencies can pay the OSG lawyers allowances and honoraria mandated by law. Once the fifty percent limit is reached by some client agencies, the other client agencies can no longer pay the said allowances and honoraria,” the OSG also said in part.But CoA said: “We still maintain our view that the receipt of honoraria/allowances in excess of 50% of their annual salaries must be subjected to limitation as set forth under COA Circular No. 85-25-E. The laws (RA No. 9417 and EO No. 292) allow the benefits, but the same laws having not fixed the amount of benefits to be granted, the allowances and honoraria must conform to the limitations stated in COA Circular No. 76-25 dated March 31, 1976, as amended by COA Circular No. 76-25-A dated June 30, 1976 and further amended by COA Circular No. 85-25-E dated April 25, 1985.”It also recommended that the OSG “require all handling lawyers to strictly comply with OSG Office Order No. 188 series of 2009 requiring the Task Force Team Leaders to report all honoraria directly received from client agencies together with the appropriate BIR form evidencing withholding of taxes to FMS OSG.”CoA made the recommendation after it found that “some allowances were directly remitted to OSG lawyers but not reported to” the Financial Management Service (FMS).“The failure of the OSG employees to report the allowances directly given to them by client agencies provides no assurance that the correct taxes were indeed withheld or no taxes were withheld at all,” CoA said.“The confirmation received from client agencies also revealed that the taxes withheld were not sufficient. These cases should not have happened had the receipt of honoraria/allowances were reported to the OSG through FMS and the correct withholding taxes have been deducted in compliance with BIR Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 10, 2008,” it added.In the same audit report, CoA told the OSG to refund excess claims for travel allowance.“The allowable travel expenses prescribed in Executive Order (EO) 298 were not strictly followed resulting in excessive claims for local and foreign travel allowances totaling ₱53,796.00 and ₱78,096.64, respectively; thus, disallowed in audit,” CoA said.Also, it found that seven employees’ monthly take home pay in 2017 were below the P4,000 mandated minimum.“The reduction of the required net take home pay of the above employees was due to the repayments of unpaid amortizations on various loans availed,” CoA said.“We recommended that management strictly enforce and implement the provisions stipulated in the GAA on the minimum take home pay of employees,” it said.GAA is General Appropriations Act.According to the audit report, the OSG has “[a]djusted the net pay as of January 31, 2018 through settlement and restructuring of loans.”",1
"AMNESTY International on Monday raised red flags about the human rights record of Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and expressed alarm at the public’s fascination with his notoriety for using trigger-happy solutions to crime.The London-based nongovernment organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, said that of the five presidential aspirants, it had been monitoring “for the longest time” the activities of Duterte, who has emerged as a front-runner in opinion polls, particularly on persistent rumors of his links to the vigilante “Davao Death Squad.”One of the mayor’s recent pronouncements that has particularly distressed the human rights group was when he said he intended to revive the death penalty and “to execute it on a weekly basis,” said Amnesty International Philippines (AIP) chair Ritz Lee Santos III.“There are no formal charges in court, but based on the records of the Commission on Human Rights, which we also monitor, there are allegations of human rights violations against him,” he said.The militant Karapatan, one of the most vocal rights groups in the Philippines, has been unusually silent on alleged vigilante killings in Davao City.“It’s general knowledge, and we don’t agree with it. But it’s hard when there’s no documentation. We should be able to substantiate any allegations,” said Cristina Palabay, Karapatan secretary general. “No one is coming forward,” she told the Inquirer.Under Duterte’s helm as mayor, congressman and vice mayor, Davao City has risen in the past two decades to become one of the world’s safest cities, but at the cost of human rights violations purportedly with the mayor’s blessing.“It’s alarming,” said AIP campaigner Wilnor Papa.“I understand why there’s a feeling of insecurity and feeling of desperation because of the state of crime. But there are other solutions besides ‘kill the criminal,’” he said.Santos clarified that the group would not campaign against Duterte, and that it had no intention of supporting any of the other candidates.“This is not specific to the person, but we want to call the people’s attention to the need for education and respect for human rights,” he said.“They have to understand that the right to life is inviolable and should not be abused at any opportunity. People ought to be educated that human rights is nonnegotiable,” Santos said.Beyond the group’s alarm at Duterte’s “shotgun policies,” he said, “we are more alarmed about how the public has responded, and how the public believes a firm hand is needed in addressing crime.”“Killing should not be made part of a bigger problem,” he said.Papa said Duterte’s alarming stance on human rights was not new to Amnesty International, which had released reports on the activities of the Davao Death Squad, a notorious group of vigilantes targeting criminals or crime suspects.“In the course of Amnesty International’s work, we have had the opportunity to call his attention on some allegations on his pronouncements that are somehow human rights violations,” Santos said.Challenge to candidatesOn Monday, the organization issued a five-point challenge to compel the five presidential aspirants to make public commitments on human rights if elected in May 2016.But none of the candidates sent any response to the organization’s letters, Santos said.Amnesty International is asking the candidates to pledge the following in their first 100 days in office:End extrajudicial executions, unlawful arrests, secret detention, enforced disappearances, torture and other ill treatment, and prevent the use of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism to justify human rights violations.Establish control and accountability over the military, the police and other state-sponsored forces, and ensure witness protection.Ensure the safe and voluntary return of the displaced, and embed human rights protection in the peace process.Make human rights a priority integrated across government bodies.Ratify key treaties on human rights and international humanitarian law.Aquino record ‘dismal’In 2010, Amnesty International issued a similar challenge to the incoming administration of President Aquino.But since then, the group has given a “dismal” rating to the administration’s approach to such issues as extrajudicial executions, unlawful arrests, secret detention, enforced disappearances and torture.“President Aquino has failed to issue an executive order showing his commitment to ending enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions,” Santos said.He said there was little progress in exacting accountability from state forces like the military and the police committing human rights transgressions.“Not one perpetrator of torture had been punished,” he said.Santos said the Aquino administration had also failed to review the Witness Protection Program, and to revoke Executive Order No. 546 directing the police to support the military in counterinsurgency work.“As in our 2010 recommendations, these are still included in our five-point human rights agenda for 2016,” he said.Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano, Duterte’s running mate, urged Amnesty people to visit Davao City.“Davao is a city where the rights of people are respected. Where women, children, Christians, Muslims and all peace-loving people live together in a safe, humane and equitable environment. This is the mark of Duterte leadership,” he said.“What is important to Mayor Duterte is to ensure that peace loving people are safe in their homes, safe in the streets. We want people from all religions, beliefs, ideologies to live together in a peaceful and fair environment.”In Angeles City Monday, former Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, who is running for senator in the administration ticket, vowed to fight Duterte.“If I have to spend the rest of my life advocating for the opposite of what Mayor Duterte stands for, I will do that even if that’s the only thing I will do,” De Lima told the Inquirer when asked for reactions to Duterte’s topping the latest nationwide survey on presidential candidates.“We’re under a system of rule of law. We are a democratic and civilized society and it is necessary that we follow a process in going after criminals,” she said. With reports from Jaymee T. Gamil, Nancy C.

"In a stunning move which Washington insiders are calling a big step towards true bipartisanship, President Obama today appointed Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul as the country’s new Vaccinations Czar.The appointment comes on the heels of the growing number of cases of measles which many believe have been precipitated by unvaccinated children. Over the last decade, many Americans have made the difficult decision not to vaccinate their children against communicable diseases like measles and hepatitis for fear the vaccinations have adverse, damaging consequences.Obama appointed Paul after the senator, an opthalmologist, made an impassioned statement on live TV regarding vaccinations. He argued Monday that debate over whether to allow parents more choice in the vaccination of their children was a matter of “freedom,” citing personal knowledge of kids “who wound up with profound mental disorders” after receiving immunizations for diseases like Hepatitis B and measles.“I don’t think there’s anything extraordinary about resorting to freedom,” the potential 2016 presidential candidate, said in an interview with CNBC.“We sometimes give five or six vaccines all at one time,” he said of immunizations of newborns for Hepatitis B. “I chose to have mine delayed….Do I think it’s ultimately a good idea? Yeah. So I had mine staggered over several months. I’ve heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children, who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines. I’m not arguing that vaccines are a bad idea, I think they’re a good thing. But I think parents should have some input.

"A Palestinian teen died Saturday of wounds sustained by Israeli gunfire at a border protest, Gaza’s Health Ministry said, as thousands attended the funeral of an 11-year-old killed in that demonstration.The ministry said Moumin al-Hams, 17, was shot in the chest at the protest on Friday along the fence that separates Gaza and Israel.The teenager appears to have been a regular participant in the weekly marches that Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza, has been leading and promoting since March.Images shared on social media by his friends and relatives show him venturing toward the fence, setting tires ablaze and pushing them toward Israeli forces.Funerals were held Saturday for Majdi al-Satari, 11, whose age was previously announced as 14, and for Ghazi Abu Mustafa, 43, killed at Friday’s rally.Gaza’s Health Ministry first reported on Friday that al-Satari was 14. On Saturday it said his age was 12. A relative provided a different date of birth and The Associated Press matched the new data with al-Mezan, a Gaza-based rights group, and confirmed that he was 11.Alaa Abdel-Fattah said he witnessed the boy’s death on Friday. He said a group of protesters were trying to cut razor wire about 50 yards away from the actual fence. He said the child was watching from about 100 meters away. “There were two gunshots from a sniper. One hit one of those cutting the wire in the leg and the other gunshot hit the boy in his head,” he said.Women gathered under the corrugated zinc roofing of al-Satari’s house for the funeral.Majdi’s mother, wearing a black niqab, sat on a mattress. “I don’t know what he did to them (the Israeli soldiers),” she said as she burst in tears. She added that his family tried to prevent him from going to the protests and on one occasion tried to lock him indoors. “It’s his fate,” she sighed.“He is a child. He had no bullets or weapons,” Um Ramzi al-Satari, the deceased’s grandmother, said. “He was standing like all children watching. They shot him from afar. Isn’t he a child? Why are they targeting children?”In a nearby town, mourners held a funeral for the 43-year-old killed in the same protest.Hassan Najjar told the AP on Friday that he had witnessed that shooting.He said soldiers shot at a group of Palestinians who rushed to the border and a bullet hit the man sitting about 250 meters away. He said the man had sustained leg wounds at a previous protest and was still using crutches.Hamas has led border protests aimed in part at drawing attention to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007.The demonstrations have been fueled in large part by pervasive despair caused by the blockade which has caused widespread economic hardship.Over 140 Palestinians, mostly unarmed, have been killed since the protests began.Israel says it is defending its border and accuses Hamas, a group sworn to its destruction, of using the protests as cover for attempts to breach the border fence and attack civilians and soldiers.Last week a Palestinian sniper killed an Israeli soldier. Another soldier was wounded by Palestinian fire on Wednesday.",1
"AdvertisementFaeldon then rebutted Gordon, recalling that since September he has offered to answer all the senator’s questions in affidavit form.WATCH THE VIDEO HERE:SponsorFormer Customs commissioner Nicanor Faeldon on Monday criticized Senator Richard Gordon’s handling of the Senate blue ribbon committee probe on the alleged corruption at the bureau, sayingFaeldon and Gordon were in a heated exchange at the resumption of the Senate inquiry on the supposed “tara” system at the Bureau of Customs (BOC).Gordon said Faeldon was allowed to hold parties even while he was under Senate detention. According to him, Faeldon’s father joined the supposed parties.“We had a dinner…It’s not a party. You know, it’s Christmas…You’re exaggerating, your honor,” Faeldon told Gordon, to which the senator replied: “Don’t tell me I’m exaggerating.”“I attended this hearing because I am now a government employee; not because I expect you will lead this committee to find out the truth. You’re so far from getting that, your honor,” Faeldon told Gordon.Gordon said Faeldon, who has remained in detention since September for refusing to appear before the committee, will remain under contempt.“I have no problem with that. I did not attend here so that I will have my liberty. I attended here so that — I’m the most interested person to ferret out the truth, which you’re so far from seeking,” Faeldon said.“You’ve been telling the public that I don’t want to participate…Do not pretend that I do not want to participate…You are already monologuing and lecturing. This is the reason why I don’t want to attend here. You are not interested about the truth,” Faeldon said.“You want this Senate to be respected but you’ve been monologuing,” Faeldon said before his mic was cut off by Gordon.Gordon has earlier threatened to transfer Faeldon to the Pasay City jail if he will refuse to appear before the committee.",0

"THE Philippines, as one of the highly vulnerable countries to climate change, must “pursue justice” in the international arena for the millions of Filipinos whose basic human rights are curtailed because of the effects of severe weather changes.Sen. Loren Legarda noted that “compared to industrialized countries, the Philippines barely contributes to global warming, and yet we bear its brunt.”She said the Philippines must demand for commitments from developed countries to have access to the Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund in anticipation of the full implementation of the Paris Agreement by 2020.“We always need to contextualize the discussion on climate change with the issue of human rights,” said Legarda, chairman of the Senate committees on Climate Change, Finance and Foreign Relations.“We cannot truly address climate change if we do not recognize the fact that climate change impinges on our very basic human rights, such as access to food, water, shelter, livelihood, and the right to life itself,” she added.Every year, millions of families get displaced, thousands of lives and livelihoods are lost and billions worth of agriculture and infrastructure are damaged because of climate change, Legarda said.“It is time that we seek justice for these tragedies. Climate justice is to demand for what is right and just for the Filipinos who everyday fall victim to climate change,” she added.“It is to improve our capacity to adapt and mitigate. It is to commit to upholding the right of every Filipino to a better life,” the senator said.She cited a report of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) that states that disasters cost the Philippine economy P206 billion annually, cutting the country’s gross domestic product by 0.3 to 0.4 percent.Between 2011 and 2015 alone, the agriculture sector in the Philippines suffered production losses of P163.6 billion because of climate change.Legarda said the Philippines also “experiences increases in school dropout rates, mental and psychological issues, outbreak of communicable diseases and malnutrition, among others, due to climate change impacts on the health and education sectors.”She also cited the global climate deal Paris Agreement, which acknowledges climate change as “a common concern of humankind, [and that] Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.”“The Paris Agreement charters a new path for the fate of humanity—one that protects our rights, safeguards our environment and secures the future for our children,” Legarda said.“We must ensure commitment from all countries and foster global solidarity in order to realize this goal,” she added.Legarda called on the Duterte administration to promote climate justice by advancing climate change adaptation and mitigation at the national and local levels.She described the Senate version of the proposed 2018 P3.76 trillion budget as a “climate budget for institutionalizing adaptation measures, as well as including special and general provisions that will ensure ecological integrity, clean and healthy environment, risk-sensitive investments, and disaster preparedness.”",1
"No contracts, just memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with Chinese companies for feasibility studies, said the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) chief, as a senator called on Malacañang to investigate how Chinese firms with tainted track records were tapped for major Philippine infrastructure projects during President Duterte’s state visit to China.But BCDA president and CEO Vince Dizon did not give a categorical answer when asked if he knew the companies he was dealing with were banned by the World Bank from participating in all road and bridge projects funded by the international financial institution.In a statement, Dizon [no relation to the Inquirer reporter] said that while BCDA admired the “diligence of the Philippine Daily Inquirer in finding the World Bank document regarding CCCC [China Communication Construction Company] and its subsidiaries … the same diligence should have been exercised in simply reading the MOU that was signed, which very clearly states that the MOU is only for the conduct of a study for the project at the cost of the Chinese company and not the Philippine government.”“It is by no means an award of the contract … We are very far from that point in the process, we are only at Step ",1
"The organizer of a Philippine beauty pageant was under questioning last week by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for the reported passing away of a contestant due to over-dieting.The incident happened during the pre-pageant rehearsals for Miss Philippines Earth 2014, when one of the contestants, Pircelyn Pialago told reporters that her roommate, Leslie Pine, passed away due to hunger.It is common knowledge that aspiring beauty queens sometimes starve themselves to death in order to stay fit and slim for the contest. The NBI wanted to know whether the pageant organizer intentionally starved the contestants in order to showcase a better line-up of pageant ladies.After completing its inquiry, the NBI determined that there was no crime or foul play committed. Apparently, Pialago meant to say that her roommate “passed out” and not “passed away.”As a result of this embarrassing situation, the pageant organizer said that beginning next year, contestants to Miss Philippines Earth will undergo a week-long English grammar lessons as part of the pre-pageant activities.Ms. Pine is alive and kicking, but didn’t win the coveted crown. Neither did Ms. Pialago.(Former Beauty Queen Joyce Burton Titular of ‘The Adventures of a Beauty Queen’ contributed to this report.)",0

"A reenacted budget for 2019 became a very real possibility on Tuesday as Malacañang and the House of Representatives hardened their positions in a standoff over spending reform.Worried about the consequences of a reenacted budget, opposition Senators Franklin Drilon and Risa Hontiveros appealed to the congressmen to resume their deliberations on the P3.76-trillion proposed budget for 2019.But Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said Malacañang must step back precisely to avoid those consequences.Projects will be derailedIn a statement, Lagman said the Duterte administration’s ambitious infrastructure project would be “derailed” because new projects could not be implemented pending reenactment of the old budget.He said appropriations for capital outlay—expenditures for new assets—also could not be repeated if these had already been completed.Lagman said “no administration would welcome a reenacted budget” because it would effectively be a “rebuke of the President,” whose budget proposal was contained in the National Expenditure Program submitted by the budget department.Drilon, the Senate minority leader, did not relish the idea of reenacting the P3.77-trillion budget for this year, saying it would make President Duterte look “weak,” because he could not get his budget proposal approved by the House despite having the support of a supermajority there.Detrimental to BARMMHaving a reenacted budget, he said, would “prejudice” every citizen and be “detrimental to the economy and the implementation of crucial laws such as the Bangsamoro Organic Law.”Other programs would be sidetracked as well, he added.“If the government operates under a reenacted budget, then there can be no new programs and projects in 2019 to help pump-prime the economy because there will be no capital outlay,” Drilon said.Hontiveros said the concerns of the congressmen about the cash-based budget system the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) wanted to implement in 2019 could be tackled without delaying the approval of appropriations measure.“Let us use the budget process to address the strategic issues of procurement and the general competency of the bureaucracy in terms of planning and execution in order to design good policies for efficient delivery,” she said.Hontiveros warned that a reenacted budget would give the executive branch the chance to abuse public funds.She noted that a reenacted budget was a fixture during the time of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, during which officials played fast and loose with the people’s money.President’s pork barrelOnce this year’s budget is reenacted, the executive could realign funds that it could use at its own discretion, Hontiveros warned.“Lest we forget, the 2019 midterm elections are just around the corner. With a reenacted budget, the government creates so-called savings from the reallocated funds for projects already completed last year to buy political support,” she explained.“In such a scenario,” she added, “the reenacted budget becomes the President’s pork barrel.”",1

Talking of colorful lights, well it’s Christmas time again – and we have the longest of this season in the world simply because Filipinos just love the NPA mentality – which is best expressed by Jerry Maguire: Show Me The Money!The NPA mentality demands that you give Filipinos the money they don’t deserve or worked hard for, because Filipinos would rather sit on their assess all day and cry out injustice when they see Henry Sy, again, on the list of top billionaires in Asia.Filipino communists are willfully ignorant (stupid on purpose) when they blind themselves of the reality that the communist party in China runs the most well-oiled capitalist mega-state in the world.

"The Social Security System (SSS) has warned its members and the public of a possible spread of fake checks after the pension fund was informed that a grocery store received as payment a fake SSS check.In a news release issued Wednesday, SSS Senior Vice President for Luzon Operations Group Josie G. Magana said the fake SSS check, amounting to P20,000, was used to pay for groceries at the Catanduanes Supermart in Virac Catanduanes by a certain Gina S. Henzon.“According to Precious Sorra, secretary of the supermart, they accepted the check after verifying the voter’s ID of the buyer, which looked valid. However, upon deposit of the check with their bank, they were informed that it was spurious,” said Magana.Sorra immediately reported the fake check to SSS-Virac.SSS-Virac branch head Divina T. Avila then instructed Edgar S. Rubio, officer-in-charge of the administrative section, to check the name and SS number of Henzon.The number was found to be invalid and the name is not registered in the SSS database.“Aside from the non-existing name and invalid SS number, the signatories in the check who were employees of SSS-Urdaneta were also forged. Authorized signatories of SSS checks are not rank-and-file employees,” said Magana.Avila later on instructed Jerald F. Competente, verifier of SSS-Virac to follow up the investigation at Barangay Palta Small in Virac, the address indicated in the check.Based on the investigation, Henzon is not a known resident of the barangay.“We advise the public, especially establishments, that before they accept checks as payment, kindly call SSS first to verify its authenticity. Also, valid SSS checks are attached to a voucher indicating the information about the payee, as well as payment details from SSS,” said Magana.To report fake checks, members and the public may call the SSS hotline at numbers 920-6446 to 55 or email member_relations@sss.gov.ph.",1
"Claims made by some power-generating firms that an increase in coal excise tax would lead to higher electricity rates in the country amount to “clear disinformation,” according to Sen. Loren Legarda.Legarda, chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, has maintained that the recent increase in the coal excise tax was so minimal as to have an effect on or result in the rise of power rates in the country.President Rodrigo Duterte recently signed the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (Train), the fist package of his administration’s tax reform initiatives, that imposes higher taxes on fuel, automobile and sugar sweetened beverages but expanded the scope of income tax exemptions.A provision of the newly signed law is the increase in the excise tax on coal from P10 per metric ton to P50.The approved coal tax rate was lower than the original proposal of the Senate that sought the imposition of 3,000 percent increase in coal taxes in three years–P100 for 2018, P200 for 2019 and P300 for 2020–both local and imported.But during the bicameral conference committee, House of Representatives contingents were able to change the rates to P50-P100-P150 starting 2018 and retain the value-added tax exemption for local coal.Legarda said if there were an increase in electricity rates next year, it would be because of the imposition of P2.50 per liter excise tax on diesel, not the P50 per metric ton or a mere five centavos per kilo on coal.“That’s clearly disinformation,” she replied when asked about her reaction to claims that the new coal tax rates would result in higher electricity cost in the country.Legarda noted that while she supports the Train bill of the administration, she has some reservations, particularly on coal taxes because of refusal of some lawmakers to impose higher tax on what is considered the dirtiest source of energy.According to her, for the past 42 years, domestic coal has been exempted from paying tax while imported coal is paying P10 per metric ton.The Philippines, she said, is also one of the countries in the region that imposes a lower tax on coal, adding that coal is taxed at about P400 to P900 per metric ton in other countries.“The imposition of new excise tax on coal was still small considering that it is the dirtiest source of energy and yet we impose higher tax on conventional fuels like kerosene, and LPG [liquefied petroleum gas],” Legarda said.",1
"There were rumors he would come. Like fans awaiting their celebrity idol, supporters held vigil outside the Commission on Elections (Comelec) office in Manila, eager to see if he would turn up.It was Oct. 16, 2015, the last day of filing the certificate of candidacy (COC) for President, and friends, political allies and supporters were in a scramble to get Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte to run.But, ever reluctant, the 71-year-old Duterte was kilometers away from the clamoring lot, holed up in his room in his hometown. Nothing made him budge. Not even the repeated pleas of a longtime friend. Not even a plane chartered especially to fetch him.Of course, like in many things with Duterte, change came. A few months later, he decided to run. Riding on popular support magnified on social media, Duterte won the May 9 presidential election by a landslide with 16.6 million votes.But the events on the final day of COC filing that Duterte missed, revealed on Tuesday by incoming House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, offered a glimpse into how running for President was a painstaking decision for the longtime mayor.For Alvarez, one of Duterte’s closest friends, the final filing day came back as a vivid recollection.“There were just three of us talking at the last minute: I, Bong Go and Koko,” Alvarez said, referring to one of Duterte’s closest aides, Christopher Go, and Sen. Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, chair of PDP-Laban.“I asked [Bong Go] where the mayor was. I was told he was in Davao. I said I will send a plane,” he said at the Meet Inquirer Multimedia forum on Tuesday.“He said ‘Don’t. He won’t leave his room,’” he said, quoting Go.But Alvarez, Duterte’s friend for over a decade and godfather to one of his children, was not about to give up.Long queueAmong the first to encourage Duterte to seek the presidency, Alvarez, also in Davao at the time, immediately arranged for a plane to bring his friend to Manila.“I called Lion Air … But I was told that there wasn’t enough time, the plane might not make it on time because the queue of planes at the airport was already long,” Alvarez recalled.“But I said ‘no, let’s try,’” he said, narrating what seemed like a scene straight out of a movie.On a mission to bring Duterte to Manila before the 5 p.m. deadline, the chartered plane for Duterte was fourth in line for takeoff at the notoriously congested Manila airport.“They (pilots) radioed the Manila Tower (the flight control tower) and said “RPC (Alvarez could not recall the complete tail number) requesting clearance for takeoff to fetch candidate Duterte,” Alvarez said.“The tower respondent: RPC, you are given permission to take off. Para sa bayan (for the nation). That happened,” said the incoming Davao del Norte representative, who first met Duterte at the chamber when they both served a single term, from 1998 to 2001.The plane did make it to Davao City. But Duterte did not make it to the plane.Plan BAt that point, Alvarez, frustrated yet still bent on making his friend run, quickly thought up Plan B.“I called Koko. He said, “Bai, let’s not make this hard for him. He really doesn’t want to run. Just let it go,” he said.“But I said no. There’s nothing to lose. File na lang, kahit sino d’yan (Just get anyone to file). Then by Dec. 8, we will go for substitution,” Alvarez said.Political parties were allowed to change their candidates until Dec. 10.“Then it was Martin Diño who filed. He filed but he made errors. So that was another problem,” Alvarez said, prompting laughter from his audience.Diño, known to the public as a crusader from the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption and an obvious placeholder for Duterte from the get-go, had written on his COC that he was running for Pasay City mayor.Out of frustration, Alvarez, who last held an elective position 15 years ago, hurriedly decided to run himself.“The following day (Oct .17), we attended a party in Solaire (in Parañaque City). Then he (Duterte) laughed at me because I ended up being a candidate, while he did not,” Alvarez said.On Dec. 8, finally ending all speculations on whether he would run, Duterte personally filed his COC as PDP-Laban standard-bearer amid much fanfare at Comelec headquarters in Manila.The Comelec accepted Duterte’s candidacy on Dec. 17, despite Diño’s erroneous COC. In February, the poll body cleared the way for Duterte’s presidential bid, junking disqualification bids contesting the PDP-Laban substitution.“I still kept convincing him. Until the end, he was convinced to run,” Alvarez said.",1

"Over the past few months I’ve heard so many theories regarding the just recently concluded elections. Some of them panned out well and others just tanked.Thing is, speculators haven’t stopped speculating with the latest rounds focusing around who President Rodrigo “PDiggity” Duterte is appointing to various government posts and there are over 20,000 such positions to be filled.It’s a bonanza for those who can get within striking distance of those positions. Looking at how some people in my circle are behaving, it reminds me of a piece of artwork that former Agriculture Secretary Cito Lorenzo showed me in his home. The artwork was a wooden panel sculpture of elephants trampling one another and Lorenzo explained that this was an apt depiction of what it was like to be one of the President’s appointees.Schmoozers will schmooze and poseurs will pose for whatever position they can lay their hands on. That’s the way it goes, I guess.Having observed battles for lucrative government appointments several times now, the fiercest ones will be for agencies that are responsible for revenue collection, agencies with huge budgets, and agencies that have discretion or control over different types of funds. The competition for these positions makes for much of the noise on mainstream and social media.Despite some controversy riddling the appointments to his Cabinet, incoming president PDiggity seems to have a more strategic view for his administration. This early he is setting broad policy directions towards the economy and finance aspects of the country like taxation, countryside development and inclusive growth in the hopes ensuring socio-economic and political stability.Word is that this early he is looking into a viable replacement for Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco who is set to retire in 2017. The BSP governor has a six year term and can be reappointed once. Of all the BSP governors only Tetangco was reappointed, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo appointed him in 2005 and he was reappointed by Noynoy Aquino in 2011.Of all the possible candidates, Duterte is eyeing Ayala Corporation’s Chief Finance Officer (CFO) Jose Teodoro K. Limcaoco, who recently came into the public consciousness with his clear, concise and very timely statement of Duterte’s banking transactions with the Ayala owned Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI).If you’ll recall, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV attempted to assassinate Duterte’s presidential campaign. The senator unleashed a supposed exposé on the latters’s BPI bank accounts housing about P211 million, leading even to a showdown dud in one of the bank’s Ortigas center branches.In could have been a catastrophic bank run for one of the largest banks in the country, but Limcaoco appeased public concerns with a statement. It was widely regarded as highly professional and strictly within the bounds of law without the jibberish and legalese formal bank statements are known to possess.“I don’t know where Sen. Trillanes got his information, but the graphic posted by the [Philippine Daily] Inquirer showing alleged credits, that is not a BPI document,” Limcaoco told Rappler.com during the controversy’s height and calls by Duterte supporters to close their accounts with the bank, especially after Liberal Party standard bearer Mar Roxas took advantage of the controversy against his rival by deporiting into the said bank accounts to reveal Duterte’s ownership of the account with the deposit slip. “The deposit slip shown by Mar or the Inquirer is not a unique thing. All banks will show the name of the depositor on a deposit slip,” Limcaoco said, brushing aside any controversy.Just to give all an idea of what the vetting process will reveal, Limcaoco’s profile in Bloomberg.com reveals an extensive banking and finance background and expertise. The profile partly reads: “Limcaoco has been the Chief Finance Officer and Finance Group Head of Ayala Corp. since April 10, 2015 and serves as its Chief Risk Officer. Mr. Limcaoco serves as the President of Liontide Holdings, Inc. and Philwater Holdings Company, Inc. Mr. Limcaoco joined Ayala Corp. as a Managing Director in May 1998. Mr. Limcaoco served as the President of BPI Capital Corporation since April 2007. Prior to April 2015, he held various responsibilities including President of BPI Family Savings Bank…” (See the full profile here.)But one thing in that profile must be noted, as it has been by the Duterte camp: “Limcaoco earned Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical Sciences (Honors Program) from Stanford University in 1984 and an MBA degree, major in Finance and Investments from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1988.”Yes, a REAL Wharton graduate… Unlike that asshat who ran for President whose name I can’t recall right now.",0

Hermosilla said that Nieto, quickly understood even very complex and challenging concepts.He was also impressed by Nieto, because it’s very rare for a math major to be a member of the university debating team, not only inside, but outside the university.According to him, even the most gifted mathematics major cannot manage to join the debating team, an evidence that Nieto is a very gifted student.The hard work of Nieto also made him survive the Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (MBB) course which he enrolled, despite of having only a little background in Biology and Chemistry.Hermosilla said that the extensive research and joining biology classes had to make Nieto catch up on many strange and mind boggling jargon of MBB.Nieto completed the MBB course and learned it more than his classmates who were majors in the course.The professor said that Nieto can learn diverse and disparate topics in a short time, because of this, he tagged the owner of Thinking Pinoy as a ‘genius’ who does not settle for just a mediocre “good enough”.This is the whole post of Augusto Hermosilla:“ RJ Nieto was one of my most brilliant students in the University of the Philippines – Diliman, Quezon City, where he majored in Mathematics, while I was a professor at the Institute of Mathematics. I can really say that I have been there all throughout his formative years in his becoming a mathematician par excellence. Indeed, he was verily one of my most brightest students. Although he didn’t have as much of a head start in college compared to his peers, especially coming from a provincial high school as compared to his peers coming from prestigious schools in Metro-Manila, he however managed to excel by hard work and dogged determination so as to top above and over all of his classes. As a very fast learner, he is someone who can easily understand even very complex and challenging concepts, and simply them as like to water them down in to something that everyone else among his peers can understand to their low level. Also, it is very rare for a math major to be a member of the university debating team, which involves in debates, not just inside, but also outside the university. Actually, he was the only one who managed to do it even as a mathematics major gifted with such impeccable and perspicacious logic. His mind doesn’t to work like anybody else. He is hardworking and so determine to excel in any field of endeavor that he can find himself interested and involved in! I remember that time when he enrolled in an elective Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (MBB) class under a visiting professor from Ludwig-Maximilians-University-Munich of Germany. He had very little background in Biology and Chemistry. But he did extensive research and even sat down in biology classes to learn to catch up on the many strange and mindboggling jargons in MBB. I can say that it was as if he majored in and learned Biology in a just month. He even ended up acing the course, even above and over his classmates who were majors in the course. That is, he did so much better than his classmates who were MBB majors themselves. This somehow shows that RJ is not just a mathematician, but a polymath at that to learn diverse and desparate topics in a short and fast time!!! When he works, he does not settle for just a mediocre “good enough.” Instead, he makes sure that everything he does is better than what he last works did. This is something that I really admire about this young man. He is a genius who should be honed to pursue more excellence.”Nieto replied to a Netizen who asked for the credibility of Professor Hermosilla, he gave an information about the professor and also about his college life in U.P.“Prof. Oggie Hermosilla was my mentor back in UP Math. He specializes in Mathematical Heuristics (e.g. neural networks, genetic algorithms), including their application to actuarial mortality models. He’s the reason why I studied Computational Biology and Biomathematics (MBB 197) on my sophomore year. I skipped Math 17 after taking the Advanced Placement Exams (with his help sa review). I also was able to finish my Calculus Series (Math 63, 64, 65, 123.1, 123.2, and 128) early and easily because he was my pro bono tutor-cheerleader. Uno ako sa lahat na yan maliban sa Math 64 dahil naadik ako sa Ragnarok noong summer na yon. Hahaha. Actually, yung Math 64 lang ang hindi ko uno. Wala na kasi ako noong pera dahil gipit na (namatayan ako ng tatay when I was 17) kaya naawa sa akin so siya na lang nagturo/nag pep talk. He’s one of the most intelligent professors UP Math has ever had.”Nieto gained thousands of new followers on Facebook because of his impressive answers and expose during the senate investigation on fake news.Aside from being a blogger, Nieto is also a consultant in Department of Foreign Affairs.We did not found the original post of Professor Hermosilla so we embedded some re posts from netizen Tony Santillan and Anj Padernal.Sources:",0
"Dear losers,Tough day, huh? It must be pretty shocking to realize that your rights-based-liberal-progressive-whatever worldview isn't shared by the majority.I hate to interrupt your circle-jerk of a pity party, but here's some unsolicited advice.Get over yourselves.The world hasn't failed you. Disabuse yourself of that entitlement. Your worldview is just one among many - and this may surprise you - your absolute certainty that you are alone are right (and your opponents are dead wrong) is something everyone believes. The world will not adjust itself to suit your worldview. You will have to adjust to the world, or make efforts to change it.To change the world, you need to change hearts and minds. You can't do that by derisively dismissing people on the other side as ignorant, racist bigots. These people, like you do, believed they are making the best decision for the country they love, and the families.The people you dismiss as uneducated racist xenophobes might have lost their jobs to globalization, or the financial crisis triggered by Wall Street. The people you mock as stupid Marcosian zealots could be people who have been waiting for over a generation for the promises of EDSA to materialize, only to be disappointed by the same empty promises made by the same oligarch families.The first woman presidential candidate lost to a misogynist, racist, Islamophobic hatemonger. Or, a maverick businessman stood up to the establishment, and beat a lying, corrupt, politician who abused power and position to enrich herself. A plundering dictator may be given a hero's burial he does not deserve. Or, a former president may be laid to rest to heal the wounds of division.Every person makes what he considers to be a rational decision - we just have different baseline assumptions of how the world works. There is no right or wrong, only winners and losers on opposite sides.I am not saying you don't have a right to feel bad, or whine about it. In fact, you should feel terrible right now. You lost, you bunch of losers.What you shouldn't do, is quit. Keep believing in your ideals. Fight for them. Stand up for your principles, even if they have been repudiated by the majority.Even as you continue the struggle, though, remember that this string of defeats warrants self-examination. Democracy has not failed. You have. Your ideals and institutions have.Your movement will not progress unless it considers why and how it has failed the people who reject it. These people have legitimate reasons and concerns, and your arrogant disdain will not bring them over to your side. Your scornful attitude may make you feel better now, but that only betrays an elitist bigotry that makes you no better than the ones you mock.The world still turns, and the sun will still rise tomorrow. Markets will trade, people will gossip, and DC movies will still continue to suck.Your loss will not be an end unless you make it one.With much schadenfreude,Your friendly neighborhood contrarian-----------------------Chrysanthus Herrera as posted on Facebook",0
"Supporters of moves to decriminalize marijuana in the Philippines, including regular and occasional smokers, were euphoric over reports that the health committee of the House of Representatives had endorsed a bill allowing the use of cannabis to treat chronic or debilitating health conditions.Social media was abuzz after the news broke online on Tuesday. “I never thought I’d say this, but thank you, Congress,” said one post on Facebook.“Let’s start planting,” another added.One corporate executive beamed with excitement as he lit a pipeful of high-grade grass in the comfort of a friend’s home.“Wow, man,” he quipped while holding the smoke in his lungs, “what a beautiful world this would be.”Oops, not so fast!No smokingIsabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano III, principal author of the measure, said the proposed Philippine Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act would expressly prohibit marijuana smoking.“It is very clear in the bill that you can’t smoke weed per se. You cannot even dispense it in its raw form and say, ‘just use this for tea.’ It has to be in medicinal form,” Albano told the Inquirer.Medical marijuana comes in various forms, including vapor, capsules, lozenges, dermal patches and oil. Albano said it could also be in tablet and “edible” form.The most widely used worldwide is cannabis oil—whose main ingredient, cannabidiol (CBD), has no psychoactive effects unlike regular marijuana.Scientific evidenceThe proposed law would to help ease the condition of people with various ailments.Albano said scientific evidence showed that medical marijuana could control epileptic seizures, manage pain in multiple sclerosis and arthritis, treat symptoms associated with HIV-AIDS and provide palliative care for end-stage cancer patients.Clinical trials also indicate the medical potential of cannabis use, including preventing cancer, managing anxiety, slowing the progress of Alzheimer’s disease, and controlling muscle spasms and tremors, he said.“I am looking forward to the swift passage of this bill. Everyday it’s a struggle to survive through pain and additional struggle to access oil from illegal sources,” cancer patient Angelina told the Inquirer.Cielz, mother of a patient with brain tumor, said: “I strongly believe that medical cannabis can replace conventional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation.”Hope for patientsRomeo sees hope that his son would be able to cope with epilepsy and cerebral palsy. “Finally, a medicine that can help alleviate his debilitating condition,” he said.Donnabel Cunanan, a dentist, said: “I am excited especially for my daughter Julia who has epilepsy, global developmental delay and cerebral palsy.”An officer of the Philippine Cannabis Compassion Society (PCCS)",1

Apparently, Xian Gaza has been engaging in various shady business and has been called out as a scammer by a realtor in Qatar and Ella Cruz' mother.A model from Davao City named Dewanie Catapang also came forward saying she too was scammed by Gaza in a supposed charity project for the victims of typhoon Haiyan.

"EDUCATION Secretary Leonor Briones led the launch of the Financial Literacy Program for Schools, a partnership project of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), Department of Education (DepEd), and BDO Foundation in Mandaluyong City.In her keynote address, Briones reiterated the importance of financial literacy.“This is what financial literacy is all about. It’s finding solutions to challenges that we face. It’s finding solutions to reaching the goals that you want to reach, what you want to be, and what you want to do with the rest of your lives,” she said.Having already incorporated Financial Literacy in the K to 12 Basic Education Program, and in the in-service training (INSET) program for teachers and non-teaching personnel, the Education department partnered with BSP and BDOF to further advance the development of financial education initiatives.A Memorandum of Agreement was signed by Briones, together with BSP Governor Nestor Espenilla Jr., and Banco de Oro Foundation President Mario Deriquito, a former DepEd undersecretary.The partnership includes the distribution of learning materials, primarily videos, which shall be used for the training of teachers and non-teaching personnel, and for classroom instruction accompanied by teachers’ guides.“We really appreciate our partners, BDO and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, for taking the initiative in helping us out in fulfilling the requirements of law,” Briones said.“It’s not only a response to requirements of law, but to our own professional capacitation, to our own personal improvement. It’s always a good thing to learn to be aware, to know what the greatest developments in our particular field are, because it makes us great teachers.

" Retired police officer Arturo Lascañas, the confessed leader of the so-called Davao Death Squad (DDS) who implicated President Duterte in extrajudicial killings during his stint as Davao City mayor, slipped out of the Philippines on Saturday night.“I have received information that a lawsuit will be filed against me, and some people are looking for me,” Lascañas told the Inquirer.He decided it was better to leave the country—“for the time being.”The retired policeman had requested the Philippine Daily Inquirer to initially withhold his whereabouts as a safety precaution, even if the Philippine government knew where he was because he properly filled out his immigration form.But after the Bureau of Immigration confirmed that he left for Singapore, Lascañas agreed that the Philippine Daily Inquirer disclose his location.Just telling the truthWas he running away from Mr. Duterte?“I’m not confronting him. I am just telling the truth, the whole truth about the killings in Davao, [and about] my involvement, because I want to have a clean conscience,” Lascañas replied.His world suddenly shrank in February when he retracted a testimony he gave to a Senate inquiry into extrajudicial killings in the President’s war on drugs last year that the Davao Death Squad and the killings it carried out allegedly on orders from Mayor Duterte were all lies.Speaking at a news conference in the Senate on Feb. 20, Lascañas confirmed the existence of the DDS, disclosed the killings ordered by Mr. Duterte, and admitted to taking part in many of them, including agreeing to the murder of his two brothers.His confession corroborated the Senate testimony last year of another confessed DDS hit man, Edgar Matobato, who claimed that Mr. Duterte was the founder and financier of the squad and the brains behind the killings of suspected criminals in the city.Matobato also admitted to taking part in many of the killings and claimed to have witnessed Mr. Duterte shoot dead a Department of Justice employee with an Uzi submachine gun.Both Matobato and Lascañas said they saw signatures of the Davao killings in the extrajudicial killings in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, but the President’s allies in the Senate said they found no evidence of extrajudicial killings in the thousands of deaths in the hands of police and unknown assailants in the antinarcotics crackdown.Lascañas admitted to lying when he first testified to the Senate inquiry into the extrajudicial killings, saying he did so out of fear for his family’s safety.Mr. Duterte’s allies have threatened to bring perjury charges against Lascañas, with Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II saying he is gathering evidence, including a copy of Lascañas’ affidavit submitted to the Office of the Ombudsman, to back up a case against the former police officer.Lascañas came forward with help from the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) and with support from opposition Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV.He had since been provided safe haven by a number of supporters, some of whom helped him flee the country on Saturday.Lascañas had said he was ready to testify against Mr. Duterte in the International Criminal Court, which warned administration officials last year that they could be called to account for possible crimes against humanity.Malacañang has denied the allegations of Lascañas, saying these are part of a plan to “destroy the President and topple his administration.”For a while on Saturday, Lascañas thought he would not be able to get out.He waited for around 15 minutes at the airport immigration counter before his passport was stamped.“They didn’t talk to me. They just told me to take a seat. They didn’t tell me why,” Lascañas said, referring to the immigration officers.One of them told the Inquirer that they had no reason to stop Lascañas from leaving.But they said they informed the Bureau of Immigration headquarters that an Arturo Lascañas was at one of the immigration counters at the airport.“The immigration staff were actually polite and even apologetic,” Lascañas said, adding the immigration officer at the counter took note of his full itinerary.Through it all, however, he said he was confident that he should be allowed to leave because there was no hold-departure order for him. He said he was not on the immigration watch list.This Inquirer reporter took the same flight as Lascañas’.‘I love our country’On Sunday morning, at a rented place, which for now he would call home, Lascañas looked well rested and relaxed.With his companions and this Inquirer reporter, Lascañas went out to walk around his new neighborhood and to have brunch.This was the first time in two months that he was able to walk some distance, and without tight security, he said.Lascañas and his companions navigated their way through the neighborhood gayly, apparently exhilarated by the absence of fear.This was Lascañas’ first time to travel out of the Philippines, and he said he had mixed feelings about it.“Of course, I’m happy that I have been able to get out. But I’m also sad because this is my first time to leave. I love our country,” he said.Then the man who admitted to killing hundreds of people allegedly on Mr. Duterte’s orders reached for a handkerchief and wiped away the tears that rolled down his cheeks.He knew it would take a long time before he could return to the Philippines.“I am sure, I will either be jailed or killed. It’s just one of the two possibilities. But for me, I know God has a plan and that would be my destiny for telling the truth. I have accepted that,” Lascañas said.",1
"President Duterte’s proclamation placing Mindanao under martial law cannot be extended anymore because its mandate to suppress the Marawi siege had already expired, opposition lawmaker Rep. Edcel Lagman argued before the Supreme Court.In a 32-page memorandum, antimartial law petitioners from the “Magnificent Seven” bloc in the House of Representatives said Mr. Duterte’s declaration that Marawi City was liberated from Islamic State-inspired terrorists on Oct. 27, 2017, as well as the cessation of military combat operations, rendered Proclamation No. 216 functus officio.Functus officioFunctus officio means the proclamation’s mandate had expired because its purpose of addressing the “violent acts committed by the Maute terrorist group” was already accomplished.Maute remnants“There is no more proclamation to be further extended,” read the memorandum.Lagman argued that the remnants of the Maute fighters and their Abu Sayyaf allies “have no capacity to continue or resuscitate a crushed rebellion or launch a new one.”No existing rebellionAntimartial law petitioners contended that no actual rebellion existed in Mindanao to justify a second extension of martial law until Dec. 31, 2018.Martial law, which was first declared on May 23, 2017 for an initial 60-day period, was extended in July until Dec. 31, 2017 because of continued violence at the time.But, Mr. Duterte justified the second extension by claiming the remnants of the defeated terror groups were trying to regroup by actively recruiting Moro youths for another possible attack in Mindanao.He also invoked the bogey of the country’s 48-year-old communist insurgency for the first time.",1
"BUHAY Partylist Rep. and Senior Deputy Minority Leader Lito Atienza welcomed the recent Commission on Audit (COA) annual audit report on the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) directing the agency to immediately dismantle illegal structures in the Laguna Lake following findings that many fish pens are owned and operated by dummy corporations. The former environment secretary had been working for the clearing of all fish pens in water bodies for being great pollutants. He said fish pens exacerbated flooding in Metro Manila, and deprived the fisherfolk of their source of livelihood. “We urge the House Committee on Good Government and Accountability to conduct an inquiry into this COA report and investigate how these companies were able to get their permits using dummy corporations and to recommend the filing of necessary charges against those responsible,” Atienza said.",1
"CHIEF Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno Tuesday warned of “profound” implications for foundlings like Sen. Grace Poe should the Supreme Court rule that the senator is barred from running for President for not being a natural-born Filipino citizen.“If you’re saying that foundlings are not natural-born citizens, have you thought about the impact on the rights of all foundlings?” Sereno asked Commission on Elections (Comelec) member Arturo Lim at the resumption of oral arguments on the poll agency’s nixing of Poe’s candidacy in the May presidential election.READ: Chief Justice: PH adoption laws recognize foundlings as Filipino citizens“The court now has to categorically answer the question about her (Poe’s) status, because the pronouncements we will make will affect so many others,” said Sereno, the second magistrate in the 15-member high tribunal to indicate support of Poe’s bid to stay in the May derby.Associate Justice Marvic Leonen who has also batted for Poe, suggested that the issue should be thrown to the electorate, supporting the contention of the senator’s allies that the voice of the people expressed in the balloting is the voice of God.Most of the other magistrates, in questioning Poe’s counsel, tended to support the Comelec disqualification of Poe’s candidacy.Aside from being President, Vice President, senator, congressman, justice or judge, a foundling who is not a natural-born citizen would not be able to become a high ranking civil servant, get a license for certain professions or even become a government scholar if Poe were disqualified, according to Sereno.“If I am going to say that a foundling is not a natural-born Filipino citizen, that they cannot hold thousands of offices that require natural-born citizens, [does it mean that] any of those persons holding any of those positions who is alleged to be a foundling, must be removed?” Sereno asked.“The moment any of them does not know their parents, they forfeit their right to office,” she said. “If your relative is a foundling, a petition for quo warranto may be brought against them to remove them from office, so the Office of the Solicitor General must set up a special division.”Sereno added that many countries recognize foundlings are citizens.MisrepresentationLim, however, stressed that the Comelec ruling that canceled Poe’s certificate of candidacy merely focused on material misrepresentations and the poll body was just implementing the Constitution’s provision on qualifications of presidential candidates.Article VII, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution provides: “No person may be elected President unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least 40 years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least 10 years immediately preceding such election.”READ: Poe on citizenship of children: ‘I give them the right to choose’The Constitution likewise defines who are natural-born citizens and these include those born of fathers or mothers who are citizens of the Philippines; if born of Filipino mothers, those who elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority.High officials take an oath to uphold the Constitution and to go against its explicit mandate would debase it with profound consequences, according to Poe’s opponents.Poe said the Comelec committed a grave abuse of discretion, averring that only the Presidential Electoral Tribunal has the ultimate power to pass upon protests on qualifications and only after the balloting.Lim said Poe never presented documentary or testimony to at least provide “substantial basis” that she is a natural-born Philippine citizen.Lim said he was leaving it up to the “wisdom” of the Supreme Court to lay down the doctrine on the matter but added that Congress could also introduce legislation to ensure that the rights of foundlings will not be degraded.Presumed filiationChief Justice Sereno argued that the fixation of bloodlines runs contrary to the Constitution which does not even mention the word bloodlines.Sereno said the Supreme Court, in the past, had decided cases regarding “filiation based on presumptions,” wherein the Philippine citizenship of foundlings was presumed by the tribunal.READ: Grace Poe: PH adoption laws boost my citizenship claimIn the 1976 case of Duncan and Christensen v. Court of First Instance of Rizal, the court held that a child who was given for adoption to a couple by a lawyer who knew the mother but was made to promise that she would not disclose her identity was presumed by the Supreme Court to be a Filipino citizen.In the 1963 case of Ellis v. Republic, the Supreme Court barred a nonresident American couple from adopting a baby left in a hospital by an unidentified mother. The court presumed the child to be a Filipino and subject to a Philippine law that prohibits nonresident aliens from adopting abandoned children in the country.Sereno also recalled that in 2004, the Supreme Court assumed that Poe’s great-grandfather Lorenzo was a Filipino even based only on the evidence that he died in Pangasinan province and was residing there when all Spanish subjects when the American came and later passed a law deeming all former Spanish subjects as Philippine citizens.Lorenzo, therefore, was also able to transfer Philippine citizenship to his son Fernando Poe Sr. and the latter’s son Ronald Allan Poe, also known as Fernando Poe Jr., who is Senator Poe’s putative father.Cruel and unjustSereno said that whatever ruling adopted by the court should not be based on “absurd and extreme interpretation that may be perceived as cruel and unjust.”According to her, foundlings who are referred to in Tagalog as ampon, pulot, singaw, sabit should not be made to suffer “extreme hardship” by having to prove Filipino parentage.At one point in the discussion, Lim remarked, “Pardon, your honor, if your advocacy is for foundlings,” to which Sereno replied, “My advocacy is for the rule of the law.”The Chief Justice discussed another presumption by law in which an adulterous woman gives birth to a child and the child is presumed to be her and her legal husband’s child.Lim agreed, saying that in cases of foundlings, only “God and the mother knows” who the father is. Sereno countered that a foundling should not be penalized if he could not name who his parents even if he “knows in her heart” that he is born Filipino.Lim replied that the “sad plight of foundlings” was not an issue in the pending case. The commissioner said the court could just “canalize” the issues against Poe and come out with a ruling that “only binds the parties and their privies.”Enact foundling lawHe said the case against Poe only came about from the questions on her citizenship and residency that was raised by the individual petitioners and the Comelec had to make a ruling.“If they had not complained, you would not have called her a liar,” Sereno said.In his interpellation, Associate Justice Antonio Carpio said limiting senior positions in government, certain professions and government benefits to natural-born Filipinos were set forth by law enacted by Congress so that they would not be opened to naturalized citizens.Carpio pointed out that in such case, Congress, by law, could have construed to have discriminated against naturalized citizens although there is no prohibition against passing any law in the future opening those positions to naturalized citizens.",1
"Have most of us done any research about the MNLF, MILF, BIFF, Abu Sayaff and ISIS? Their differences, their Ideologies and their History? Why did their splits occured?MNLF and MILF are two organizations who advances Bangsamoro Nationalism and Independence.The difference in MNLF and MILF now is that both of them have opted for Autonomy instead of Secession. They are tired of War. Have you ever spoke to an MNLF or an MILF to hear their side? Are you not happy that they have a change of heart?They were not different from the Katipuneros during the spanish time. If we are in the Spanish era, most of us will also call Bonifacio and Rizal Erehe and Terrorists and most people will also call for their execution.Its a fact that during a war, there will always be a possibility to coddle a certain individual or group of people with a different agenda and Ideology distinct from the mainstream just to advance a certain struggle.That would not be obvious until the mainstream had a change of heart and settle the war through negotiations. Those who do not agree will eventually split off. In war, everything could be an asset.See how the Middle Class, the Oligarchs and various Leftist groups succeeded on toppling Marcos. How the Katipuneros fought for Independence and split off between Aguinaldo's faction who surrendered to the US and Bonifacio who continued the fight.The question is who hijacked the Revolution in the end?Many of us specially from Luzon and Visayas are calling to Junk the BBL, calling for an All-Out-War and urging the Government to abandon the peace process NOT because they want to improve it but because of Islamophobia.For me, we can Improve the Peace Agreement to make it Comprehensive or even renegotiate it if it is needed. But not Junk it or wage a war that is not winnable. All-out-war never solved the problem in mindanao. It just made it worse.To Equate the MILF and MNLF to ISIS is a product of Lack of knowledge.The MILF is giving its best to transform itself from a Radical Secessionist Movement to a Moderate Force.The leadership of these two fronts (MNLF and MILF) are distancing themselves from former members who have an Extremist agenda (BIFF and Abu Sayyaf). They never pledged allegiance to ISIS because they basically reject it.Why don't we give those who have a change of heart a chance? They need a helping hand to purge their ranks from these Radical elements and stop its spread to its members. Only thru Peace it would succeed because once peace is in place, Their Jihad is no longer relevant.Those who like war are either of the 2:1) A Radical who wants to subjugate or eliminate every single muslim who exist from the face of the earth2) A Radical Muslim who likes to prove that all muslims can never trust a non-believer (Kafir) and that only thru their brand of a separate Islamic state, they would be happy and free.THE MORE WE ALIENATE MUSLIMS THE MORE EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY CREEPS INTO THEIR MIND.MORE OF THEM WILL EITHER BECOME VICTIMS OF EXTREMIST PROPAGANDA AND SOON BECOME EXTREMISTS THEMSELVES WHO WILL CRAVE FOR A SEPARATE STATE WHILE THE MODERN FILIPINO MODERATE MUSLIM WILL EITHER BE A PROUD MALAYSIAN THAN A FILIPINOWould you love to see our Muslim Filipino youths radicalized?Extremists are at work 24/7 to use the flames of war to promote their ideology. They are exploiting the Alienation of Muslim Filipinos.Extremist are working day and night to Phase out the Bangsamoro Nationalist Agenda of both MNLF and MILF and replace it with their own Ideology and Totalitarian Brand of Islam.That is why MILF is asking for peace because time is running out.Not because they want weapons to kill us but because time is running out to counter the ISIS IDEOLOGYThe more war is prolonged, their (MNLF, MILF) influence and relevance will fade…….. and once their influence fades, A VACUUM WILL BE THERE EXPLOITED TO BE FILLED BY EXTREMISTS SET TO HIJACK THE MORO STRUGGLE IN FAVOR OF THEIR SIDE!Just like how EDSA was Hijacked in the End. We dont want the Extremist to Hijack the Moro struggle in the end. Only Muslims can solve an Islamic Problem! The MNLF and MILF would be able to help!Now, that is the reason why our Generals do not want an All-out-war to those having a change of heart because they understand the situation more than an any keyboard warrior could understand.Dont forget that the MILF is 10,000 strong. They too also have families ready to take arms if pushed to a corner. War is not a Joke.--------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"The Senate would no longer hold an impeachment trial for poll chief Andres Bautista once it receives official word from Malacañang that President Rodrigo Duterte accepted his resignation, according to Senate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto III.Sotto on Saturday said that the Senate must be formally informed by the Office of the President that Mr. Duterte had accepted Bautista’s resignation, which the Commission on Elections (Comelec) chair said would take effect on Dec. 31, 2017.“If the President accepted his resignation, we should be sent a copy so we don’t have to convene [as an impeachment court]. We cannot just get the information from the media,” Sotto said in a radio interview.In an interview with the government-run TV station PTV aired on Friday night, Mr. Duterte said he had accepted Bautista’s resignation.The House of Representatives impeached Bautista on Wednesday just hours after he announced that he was stepping down at the end of the year.“I don’t know if you can still impeach him or not because by resigning, he has removed himself from [the Comelec],” the President said in the PTV interview, which was recorded on Thursday.“But what was on my mind really was, the other day, if Bautista steps down it would be better. There would be no more trouble,” he said.Several senators have said they would have to proceed with Bautista’s trial after the House transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate.Minority Leader Franklin Drilon has warned that the passage of two major bills—the proposed 2018 national budget and the tax reform package—would take a backseat once the Senate commenced the impeachment trial.Congress has gone on a break until Nov. 13.“Our calendar is too tight and the impeachment case will eat up a lot of our time when we resume session in November. Legislative work will be seriously affected and that is a matter that the leadership should highly consider,” Drilon said.In a forum on Wednesday shortly after he announced his resignation, Bautista said he delayed stepping down so that his successor would be given time for “a smooth transition.”“It’s hard when you’re suddenly thrust into the position,” Bautista said. “I will prepare a memorandum to my successor to identify the issues to be focused on. I’ve always believed that succession planning is a very important component in an organization.”House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas said it was “unfortunate” that Bautista did not inform the House of his plan to resign, which the Comelec chief announced the same day the lawmakers were scheduled to discuss his impeachment case.He said Bautista was aware that the House was going to consider his impeachment on that day.Fariñas said there was no more need for the justice committee to determine the substance of the impeachment complaint against Bautista because the plenary had already ruled on it.He disputed the contention of Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman that the committee should have been allowed to thresh out the substance of the complaint before preparing the articles of impeachment.“The Committee has to follow the House, which by a vote of more than one-third of all its members, decided to impeach Bautista,” Fariñas said.The justice committee could no longer determine the sufficiency of the impeachment complaint’s substance since the House had spoken and impeached Bautista, he added.Bautista was accused of betrayal of public trust and culpable violations of the Constitution for not declaring his true wealth in his statement of assets, liabilities and net worth, as well as for graft and corruption for allegedly receiving commissions from DivinaLaw, the legal counsel of Venezuelan election technology supplier and Comelec’s biggest contractor Smartmatic.The impeachment complaint was filed by former Negros Oriental Rep. Jacinto Paras based partly on allegations made by Bautista’s estranged wife, Patricia. It was endorsed by Deputy Speaker Gwen Garcia, Kabayan Rep. Harry Roque and Cavite Rep. Abraham Tolentino.The marriage troubles between Bautista and his wife were a “blessing in disguise” because it uncovered the “very mind-boggling” wealth that the Comelec chief accumulated, Paras told reporters when he filed the complaint in August.“Whatever quarrels they have, at the end of the day, this is beyond domestic quarrel,” Paras said then.",1
"THE DRIVER-BODYGUARD of Sen. Leila de Lima will be the star witness in the proposed House of Representatives’ inquiry into the proliferation of drug syndicates at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) during her term as justice secretary.In a press conference, Deputy Speaker Karlo Nograles said President Duterte himself believed that De Lima’s driver, Ronnie Palisoc Dayan, played a key role in the alleged illicit transactions between De Lima and the drug lords inside the NBP and that he could be a state witness.“The probe is for the sake of transparency and accountability. If it involved the driver, Congress must send an invitation for him to air his side,” Nograles said in a press conference.Eleven House leaders led by Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez have filed House Resolution No. 105 for either the committee on justice or public order and safety, or both, to investigate the culpability of De Lima and other officials of the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) in the conversion of the NBP as a virtual headquarters of drug lords to produce “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) and direct their operations outside the penitentiary.Deputy Speaker Sharon Garin said that Congress would give De Lima a courtesy invitation to attend the hearing as resource person to help lawmakers craft laws that would avoid these anomalous drug transactions inside the maximum security prison.“We have to ask her what went wrong. She and other officials are in the best position to explain to us what happened,” Garin said.Deputy Speaker Raneo Abu said that Congress had no choice but to zero in on De Lima because she was responsible for the BuCor and the NBP when a December 2014 raid in the state prisons yielded a shabu laboratory and high-powered guns, jewelry, cash and luxury cells of drug lords Peter Co and Herbert Colangco.He said the abuses happened under her watch and she was ultimately responsible for these due to command responsibility.Abu, however, would not say if the President would reveal his alleged evidence against De Lima and her driver in the House hearing.The President claimed in his previous speeches that he had recordings of calls and ATM transactions of De Lima’s driver and the drug lords.Aside from De Lima and her driver, Abu said the House would also invite former Justice Undersecretary Francisco Baraan III, BuCor chief Ricardo Rainier G. Cruz III and his successor, Franklin Jesus B. Bucayu.Nograles said the House was also planning to invite the drug lords as resource persons depending on whether they would be allowed to leave prison or the hearings would be held inside the NBP.Aside from Alvarez, Nograles and Abu, the resolution to investigate De Lima was also signed by Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas, Rizal Rep. Michael John Duavit, Antipolo Rep. Romeo Acop, Minority Leader Danilo Suarez, Iloilo City Rep. Jerry Treñas, Cavite Rep. Abraham Tolentino, Oriental Mindoro Rep. Salvador Leachon and Valenzuela Rep. Eric Martinez.Ifugao Rep. Teddy Baguilat said the House probe on De Lima smacked of political persecution because the same lawmakers pushing for the NBP probe were the same people blocking his proposal to investigate the extrajudicial killings in the police operations against illegal drugs.Baguilat said the probers were unduly focusing their probe on single person when the problems of NBP extended beyond the Aquino administration.",1
"Philippine citizens may have a hard time visiting the United States on business or tourism, but the Filipinos are better off than U.S. citizens when it comes to the 2016 Summer Olympics to be held next year in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Philippine citizens need a visa to enter the United States and thousands are denied their visa applications year after year. This, despite the fact that U.S. citizens do not need a Philippine visa when traveling to the island nation as long as they do not stay beyond 30 days.But when it comes to Brazil, Filipinos have an advantage over U.S. citizens. Philippine citizens do not need a visa to enter Brazil, but U.S. citizens do.So when it comes to the 2016 Summer Olympics, Filipinos will have the last laugh, while U.S. citizens will be scratching their heads trying to complete and submit the strict visa application requirements.Oh, did we already mention the visa processing fee of $160?Last June, Brazil’s tourism minister said that the country may lift its visa requirements so that Americans can come to see the 2016 Rio Olympics, but nothing has yet been made official.",0
"Once he assumes power, incoming President Rodrigo Duterte will immediately tackle two critical problems that confront, if not hurt, Filipinos daily: crime and poor public transportation.“I have to declare a crisis in the war against crime and on the part of commuter trains and all. I have a crisis there,” said Duterte, the longtime mayor of Davao credited for curbing crime in his city and enforcing strict traffic regulations.“My crisis begins with Edsa, and the other crisis is that there are a lot of drugs. We’re fighting them on so many fronts,” he said in an hourlong news conference close to midnight on Saturday.“My first big project is the establishment of a railway for the Philippines. There are those who want to help, and we will ask them, what’s the payback?” he told reporters.There is no detailed plan yet, but Duterte’s vision includes train lines connecting Manila to Nueva Vizcaya province in the north, Sorsogon and Batangas provinces in the south, and a system “for the whole of Mindanao.”“Maybe China” will be involved, he said. “I tell you frankly, we do not have the money for it.”An earlier plan to partner with China was derailed in 2012 following a corruption controversy.The NorthRail project, which was initiated under President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, was meant to link northern Metro Manila with Diosdado Macapagal International Airport in Clark Field, Pampanga province.But the project was canceled in 2012 after the Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal for lack of competitive bidding. The Philippines was obligated to return some $593 million in loans to China for the project.Delicate balanceThe project’s dissolution also came at the height of a dispute between Manila and Beijing over territory in the South China Sea.Asked how he would manage the delicate balance between seeking infrastructure support from China and pursuing the country’s bid to stop its incursions into Philippine waters, Duterte said: “Just because you’re building me the railway doesn’t mean to say that I am abandoning the Scarborough Shoal.”The shoal is among Philippine-claimed features in the disputed waters.The Philippines has a pending arbitration case in a United Nations court that aims to invalidate China’s claim to almost all of the South China Sea, and to stop its intrusive activities, including land reclamation and sea patrols.The tribunal is expected to issue a ruling within the year. China has refused to participate in the proceedings, asserting its “indisputable sovereignty” over the waters.“I told you that is ours, you have no right to be there,” Duterte said.“[The dispute] involves the principle of the law of [the sea that] says you have the exclusive right to develop and make use of your exclusive economic zone. If you build something that impedes that, it obstructs that right and the exercise of that right given by international law,” he said.Duterte said he expected that “China will follow” the tribunal’s ruling.On the crime front, Duterte said he was hoping the police would start stepping up even before he formally takes office. The mayor, who has been linked to death squads, is notorious for his heavy-handed approach to fighting crime but is highly regarded in his hometown.‘Show me bodies’On Wednesday, he called a midnight press conference to give Manila law enforcers a dressing down for failing to stop the distribution of drugs at a Pasay City rave where five youths died after taking a fatal cocktail of toxic pills.“I’m happy to hear that they (police) have started their (antidrug) operations in some other areas, provinces and cities. I’d like to tell the police that they should not wait for me until I become President,” he said.Duterte said he would recruit 3,000 more police officers and create two more Army divisions for a special purpose related to security, which he did not reveal.He said the police should present him results of their work. “Show me cold bodies,” he added.",1
"Recently Binibining Pilipinas candidate Sandra Lemonon generated a buzz in the internet world with her brutally honest answer in the question-and-answer portion. She was asked by a judge a question about her insights on the government’s Build, Build, Build program?Lemonon, regretfully, does not have any idea what Pres. Rodrigo Duterte’s flagship program. She told the judge, “Actually you know what, I studied so much for this Q&A, but sadly that’s something that I don’t know really much about. But at least I’m here trying to answer a good question. Thank you.”It is unfortunate that she does not know what is going on in her country. But honestly, she is not alone. There are more Filipinos like her who have no idea about what the government is doing to make their lives better. Sadly, unlike Lemonon who is honest about her lack of knowledge, many of those who are unaware are also the ones who are unrelenting in their bashing of the government and the president.In a nutshell the Build, Build, Build program of the government is part of the 10-point Socioeconomic Agenda of Pres. Duterte envisioned to reduce poverty from 21.6 percent to 13 percent by 2020.Under the Build, Build, Build Program the administration targets to build key infrastructures that will help the country increase its productive capacity, create jobs, increase incomes, and strengthen the investment climate that will lead to sustained inclusive growth (http://www.build.gov.ph/).The government targets to spend 8 to 9 trillion pesos on these infrastructure projects from 2017 to 2022.Some of the projects under this program include the NLEX-SLEX Connector Road, Panguil Bay Bridge, Bacolod Economic Highway, Metro Cebu Expressway, Davao City By-pass, Leyte Tide Embankment Project, Apayao-Ilocos Norte Road, Zamboanga City By-pass Road, Panguil Bay Bridge, Cebu Bus Rapid Transit, and many more.The Build, Build, Build Program of the government is the reason why you see so many Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) personnel working so hard under the heat of the sun even throughout the night. It is the reason why our roads are wider and nicer. It is also the reason why areas that you can’t get to in the past are now accessible. It is the reason why the islands are much more connected than in the past.Some people say that the Build, Build, Build Program is one of President Duterte’s defining legacy, but if you really know him, he does not care for that. He just wants to make the lives of Filipinos better.Now, if you ever join a beauty contest and you are asked about the Build, Build, Build Program of the government, you know the answer.",0
"FARMERS and fishermen who brought their produce to the Department of Agriculture’s TienDA “Malasakit” food outlets in Manila and Quezon City earned about P2 million in a one-day sale on Friday, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol said.Citing data from the department’s Agribusiness and Marketing Office, Piñol said total sales from outlets in the Bureau of Plant Industry Compound in Manila and the Central Office in Quezon amounted to P2,069,912 on September 28.In San Andres, Manila, gross sales totaled P1,224,552. Sales in the Central Office were placed at P725,360 while sales from National Food Authority (NFA) rice totaled P120,000.Piñol said the “Malasakit’ food outlets, which were first opened on September 21 in Manila and last Friday in Quezon City, were filled “with huge crowds enjoying fresh vegetables, fish, fruits, chicken and rice at farm gate prices.”The agriculture chief earlier said DA was looking at expanding the scope of its food outlets in other areas in Metro Manila and every barangay or village in coordination with local government units.“Next week, the third TienDA Farmers and Fishermen’s Outlet will be opened in Alabang, Muntinlupa to serve consumers in the southern part of Metro Manila,” Piñol said in a Facebook post dated September 29.“On October 13, the TienDA Malasakit Store will be opened in Taguig City with the support of Mayor Lani Cayetano,” he added.A TienDA Malasakit Store will also be opened in Bulakan in the second week of October, said Piñol.The opening food outlets is intended to to bring down the high prices of basic goods in Metro Manila. The TienDA Malasakit Food Outlets will be open every Friday and Saturday until market prices for basic goods stabilize, the Cabinet official said.The vegetables being sold, per kilogram, include: okra (P45), tomato (P50), eggplant (P55), sitaw or legumes (P55), chayote (P40-P60), ampalaya or bitter gourd (P60), potato (P75), carrots (P120), cabbage (P80), radish (P60), Baguio cabbage (P120) and bell pepper (P120).Also sold per kilo are: mangosteen (P100), lanzones (P100), rambutan (P60), sweet corn (P35), cardava bananas (P25), papaya (P15) and cassava (P15).The red chili pepper or siling labuyo, which reached P1,000 per kilo price in previous weeks, is being sold at the ‘Malasakit’ Food Outlet for P400 per kilo or P5 for 2 pieces.The agricultural commodities were sourced from farmers in Mindanao, particularly Bukidnon and Davao.",1
"THE Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) gave assurances on Monday that it is not violating any law in response to a report of the Commission on Audit (CoA) regarding the possible depletion of funds due to its online Keno operations“We welcome COA audit report regarding our transactions, but we would like to assure you that we are not violating any law and we are cognizant of our obligations and responsibilities,” said PCSO General Manager Alexander Balutan.The CoA earlier warned the agency over its “questionable” transactions worth more than P10.17 billion intended for charity and programs and medical assistance as well as a possible fund depletion because of the online Keno gaming operations.The Keno gaming operation incurred a P4.2 billion deficit in its prize fund from 2006 to 2017.From January to June this year, the overall PCSO revenue hit the P25 billion mark, 27.25 percent higher than the income earned in the same period last year, where Lotto and digit games were at the forefront with P12.5 billion sales; followed by Instant Sweepstakes with P727 million sales.“Keno had P2.3 billion sales, an increase of 10.36 percent in five months alone,” Balutan said in an earlier statement.Arnel Casas, Officer in Charge-Assistant General Manager for gaming sector, said the PCSO is addressing the “perceived” deficit in the prize fund of the Keno game, adding that an approved prize payout structure was supposed to be implemented last year.Casas explained that the implementation of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (Train) law required a substantial amount of 20 percent Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) to be imposed on the total sales of the Keno, which greatly affected the implementation of the approved fund allocation.“It gave a smaller percentage to fund allocations particularly to the prize payout structure of the Keno game. As a result of the new scheme, the game became less attractive to the gaming patrons and players,” he said.“The same also delayed the scheduled implementation, as the PCSO needs to go back to the drawing board to further study and analyze its effect,” he added.A new revenue allocation with the inclusion of the DST and new prize payout structure will be implemented for the Keno game. This will require system and gaming software change which under normal process will take around three to six months to complete.Once implemented, depending on the support and response of the gaming public to the new prize structure and the amount of sales realized, the PCSO shall decide on whether to continue or discontinue the game.",1

Meiring was severely injured; nevertheless, US government agents appeared at the hospital and spirited him away, first to Manila and then to the United States [AsiaTimes].The Davao City Prosecution Office alleged that Meiring was a terrorist bomber [MindaNews], but the courts weren’t able to proceed with the case because Meiring has already been whisked out of the country by the US government itself before he can be arraigned.""It was early in the morning when (then-US Amb.) Ricciardone flew here and met with me in a hotel here. He assured me then that they will conduct an investigation regarding the Meiring incident. Yet since then, the US government failed to fully explain to me how come they violated our sovereign right to prosecute Meiring who committed a crime here in our city,"" Duterte said in 2011 [Tesiorna].6th Suspect: Chinese GovernmentThinkingPinoy’s TakeawaysDONT FORGET TO SHARE!RELATED POSTS:The Roxas Night Market is an extremely popular hangout place for Davaoeños. Located at the heart of downtown Davao, locals flock the place to find cheap and delicious eats, oftentimes in the company of family and friends. Its setup is similar to the Banchetto in Mandaluyong’s Ortigas Center and the Midnight Mercato in Taguig’s Bonifacio Global City.September 2nd, a Friday, was another fun-filled day for Roxas Night Market regulars. That is, until around 10:00 PM when a bomb exploded, killing at least 14 people and injuring at least 60 others [ ABS ]. The entire nation was in shock. How can something like this happen in no less than the President’s home town?Davao City is close to my heart, and I have been grieving for two days. While I was born and raised in Luzon, it was my three years in Davao City that taught me how to be human. While I was born Tagalog, my heart is totally Bisaya.But now that the smoke has slightly cleared, it is time to analyze the fateful incident and see what can be done about it. At this point, I will set aside everything I feel about the incident and examine the situation using nothing but logic and history. Specifically, I will list down all the potential suspects, and examine, based on past news articles, the probability of each entity on the list being the actual culprit. Note that this is just a tentative list, but any investigation needs a starting point, and this is it.This bears repeating: I will set aside all my emotions for now and I will evaluate the list as objectively as I can. Now, let’s tentatively list down the possible suspects.This is a pretty diverse list, right?Let's start.This is the Yellow Fan Favorite.Some members of the opposition would expectedly try to pin this incident on Duterte, as it can be compared to the August 1971 Plaza Miranda Bombing that killed nine and injured 95, mostly oppositionist Liberal Party supporters [ LP ]. The Liberal Party blamed then-President Ferdinand Marcos for the incident, alleging that the latter used it to justify the imposition of Martial Law [ MT ].Incidentally, it’s also the Liberal Party who’s in the opposition today. And this is what they would like us to believe this angle, especially since they are fond of painting Duterte as a megalomaniacal dictator-wannabe.But there’s a problem.Duterte has been offered the DILG post by former presidents Ramos, Estrada, Aquino, and Arroyo, and he declined all of them [ AC Inq ], despite his full knowledge that the DILG post is the perfect springboard for running for higher office.Duterte was also offered to be the 2016 vice-presidential running mate of Roxas [ GMA ] and Binay [ GMA ], but he declined. He was continuously pushed to run for president, but he declined every time, even going as far as saying only an alien abduction of Roxas, Binay, and Poe, will force to make him run [ Inq ], and it was only a last-minute large-scale, grassroots call for him to run [ GMA ] that finally changed his mind.No, these are not the deeds of someone who’s hungry for power.The man spent thirty years transforming an economic backwater into a booming cosmopolitan city. With Duterte’s leadership, what was once a killing field in the late ‘80s turned into a safe and secure city with a vibrant economy [ Edge ].At 71, it’s unlikely that he can leave a legacy more prominent than that, so why would he mess it up?Why would he bomb a city where his children and grandchildren live? Why would he turn it into a hell-hole? It does not make sense.If he really wanted to bomb a city for his alleged political motives, he would’ve bombed NCR cities instead. If I were Duterte and I wanted to a sequel to the Plaza Miranda Bombing, I would’ve bombed the Araneta Center, where the Liberal Party Headquarters is. But it isn’t the case.So no, Duterte probably didn’t do it.Many Duterte Die-hard Supporters say the Liberal Party did it. After all, the bombing fits perfectly into their plan. Despite the lack of evidence [ TP: Gascon ], the Liberal Party has managed to convince the international community that Duterte is a megalomaniac. With the bombing, and assuming that Duterte will declare Martial Law as a result, then LP would have succeeded in making him look not only megalomaniacal, but also dictatorial.From the LP's point of view, this also happens to be the perfect diversion. The public has been feasting on LP Senator Leila de Lima and her alleged drug links, so the LP could have possibly copied former Senator Juan Ponce Enrile’s alleged Zamboanga Siege Tactic [ Inq ].There is one major issue with this theory, however.There is no evidence so far that suggests LP’s complicity in the Davao City bombing incident. I am not Leila de Lima, so I do not like accusing without sufficient evidence. Yes, the motives are there, but motives alone are not enough to prove criminal liability.LP as a potential suspect? Yes.LP as the most probable suspect? No, not yet.Prior to the incident, Duterte said the government has received threats from the IS-linked terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) [ TP: Video ]. The Philippine National Police (PNP) also blamed ASG for the bombing incident [ AlJazeera ].Yesterday, ABS-CBN reported that ASG owned up to the Davao blast [ ABS ]. The problem, however, is the fact that ABS-CBN failed to include a direct quote from ASG’s spokesman categorically saying that ASG did it. Not surprisingly, CNN reported this morning that ASG’s spokesman categorically denied ASG alleged involvement in the bombing incident [ CNN ].I hate to admit it, but ASG’s denial makes some sense. Let me explain why., shrapnel found in the blast site are similar to ones found after the 2003 Sasa Wharf and Davao Airport Bombings [ Sun.Star ]. While this may qualify as circumstantial evidence, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are relatively low-tech bombs so the technology used in them is hardly proprietary. That is, even if the ASG can create such an IED, other groups can create similarly-designed IEDs too., ThinkingPinoy received a PNP internal memo dated 26 August 2016 that warns local police stations of a possible ASG bomb plot in Davao or Metro Manila. The memo is shown below:The memo mentions suicide bombers. However, Davao was bombed using a standalone IED. That is, the PNP may be talking about a bomb threat that’s totally separate from whatever happened last Friday.and most importantly, Abu Sayyaf has never denied involvement with terrorist activities before.Terrorists feed on terrifying the populace, so it’s just logical for them to own up to any successfully perpetrated terrorists attack. After all, that’s just like getting extra street cred for free. I searched for any page published before 01 September 2016 that contains “Abu Sayyaf denies” [ Google ], and not a single article showed such an ASG denial in the past.What’s the point? If ASG denied involvement, then it may actually be, at least partially, true.The Duterte government has already been waging war on ASG for several weeks now, with Duterte reportedly planning to ramp up troops two days before the bombing incident [ WSJ ].If I were the ASG, I would prefer a long protracted guerrilla war where troops trickle in, instead of an all-out government offensive that may overwhelm my terrorist forces. If I were ASG, I can more manageably resist government forces that way.What would bombing Davao City do? That may just coax Duterte on going full-force against ASG, and that’s the last thing ASG wants, and that’s exactly what happened when Duterte announced Saturday – a few hours after the Davao bombing – that he will send 7,000 troops to eradicate ASG.While I cannot totally discount ASG’s involvement, the latter’s spokesterrorist actually makes at least a little sense when he denied the group’s involvement.Regardless of whether you’re for or against Duterte’s war on drugs, the fact remains that it has yielded very tangible results, one of which is decreasing profit margins for drug syndicates [ TP: PH Drug Industry ].Some may argue that bombings is not the style of drug cartels but the US military says otherwise [ US Mil ].Now, Duterte is pretty difficult to assassinate, having survived terrorist-infested Mindanao for over 70 years. Thus, drug cartels can, at least for now, attempt to destabilize his government by bombing no less than his home town.This is a very interesting angle given that three inmates bolted a North Cotabato prison just two weeks ago. These inmates were facing charges of illegal possession of explosives and illegal drugs [ Inq ].Three drug dealers who happen to know something about explosives magically escaped prison. Two weeks later, an IED blast rocks Davao city, home of the president who’s in the middle of the war against drugs.Go figure.The United States has been very critical of the Duterte Administration’s war on drugs, going as far as insinuating that Duterte has a hand in the vigilante killings that has plagued the latter’s government for the past couple of months.Just last week, its pro-war Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power tweeted, “Alarming reports of ongoing extrajudicial killings in #Philippines; government must respect human rights and rule of law [ Power ]”.Duterte is the first president since God-knows-when who took a neutral stance on the US-China rift. Since the South China Sea ruling, we have seen how Duterte chronically refused to definitively side with either. This is a welcome development for China in light of the severely antagonistic Aquino Administration.But this is alarming for the US, as it has always been used to having Philippine presidents who are willing to kiss its ass on command. Vice-president Leni Robredo along with her political party is very much pro-US, and it would be theoretically more convenient for the Americans to have Robredo as president instead.So why not do something to catalyze Duterte’s political demise?The communist New People’s Army also blames the US for the Davao Bombings [ Inq ], but I do not want to give much credence to them, because the communists love to blame the US for everything. Besides, many Filipinos would scream, “But the US is not a terrorist!”However, an incident from the relatively recent past suggests otherwise.Basically, in 2002, the US government coddled a terrorist who actually attempted to terrorize Davao City. So yes, the idea of US involvement in the 2016 Davao City Bombing is not far-fetched.Another angle would be planted evidence, an angle that the opposition oh-so-gloriously loves to ignore when it’s convenient for them. This theory is pretty simple: the Chinese Government bombs Davao City and make it appear as if the United States did it, thereby tilting Duterte’s stance on the China-US spat.The problem with this theory, however, is that it's unlikely., because China is not widely-known for state-sponsored terrorism. Aside from a CATO Institute article insinuating otherwise, there’s little documented evidence that China actually does that., because if it backfires, then China is toast. That is, the risks outweigh the benefits. If China indeed bombed Davao City and local investigators confirm this, then it’s over for PH-China relations for the foreseeable future, and it may even be used as a justification for a more decisive Western military presence in the South China Sea.That’s something that China doesn’t want, especially since they see Duterte as a bright spot for often-strained PH-China ties. I cannot imagine how China can be desperate enough to do it, so they probably didn’t.These six potential suspects listed in this article are just theories and this article does not, in any way, definitively blame any of these six. Instead, I wrote this article to help you understand that the situation is not as simple as “De Lima did it!”.

"As various groups prepare massive street protests against the burial of the late President Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, President Rodrigo Duterte said on Wednesday he would allow them to stay in public places for as long as they would want – even without securing permits from local officials.He also said he would order the military to stay in their barracks during the protests. But a lean number of police and traffic personnel would be on hand.While noting plans to greet his return from Peru and New Zealand with rallies, Duterte continued to stand pat on his position to allow Marcos to be laid to rest at Libingan ng mga Bayani, even chiding protesters.He said he would step down from office if they could show that Marcos had not been a president or a soldier – among the qualifications for being allowed burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.“To all the protest organizations, let me throw this simple proposition to you.

"Luxembourg may be the only country in the world where the prime minister and vice prime minister are both gay men, but that record could soon be eclipsed by the Philippines where two women may be elected president and vice president in the coming May 9 elections.Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel and Vice Prime Minister Etienne Schneider, are both openly gay.The Philippines has had women presidents in the past — Cory Aquino and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo — but this year’s electoral contest could put the country on the world map as the only one with the top leaders being both women.The latest national polls shows Senator Grace Poe leading the pack of what Filipinos fondly call, “presidentiables” — those who COULD be president. Poe was recently cleared by the Supreme Court to run for president after it decided a disqualification case (DQ) in her favor. By a vote of 9-6, the high court ruled that Poe, a foundling, is a natural-born Filipino citizen and has fulfilled the 10-year residency required of all presidential candidates. Poe’s opponents include the incumbent Vice President, Jejomar Binay; former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas (President Aquino’s anointed one); Davao Cityi Mayor Rodrigo Duterte; and Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago. Poe has consistently led in the polls.For the vice presidential contest, the latest poll shows Leny Robredo closing in on top rivals Senators Chiz Escudero (Poe’s running mate) and Bongbong Marcos (Santiago’s running mate).While Robredo is the VP running mate of Roxas, Philippine electoral rules allow for voters to elect a president and vice president who may be from different political parties, unlike in the U.S. where it is a party winner-take-all for the presidential and vice presidential contest.The Philippines is known for its penchant for world records — in boxing, beauty contests, or the Guinness World Record.Will the Philippines bag yet another honor come May 9?",0
"THE GLOBAL development agenda should include the protection of young people from the evils of drug abuse, Foreign Affairs Secretary-designate Teodoro Locsin Jr. said, pointing to the Philippines’ youthful population.Addressing the Asia-Europe Meeting in Brussels, Belgium last week, Locsin noted that the Philippines was experiencing a “demographic sweet pot.”“Here supposedly is a vast store of potential energy and innovation. But it won’t be realized without right policies and programs,” he said.“The demographic dividend doesn’t come with ingrained business plans and specific job skills. It is a raw energy but with a moral dimension for being valuable in itself as composed of people,” Locsin added.Thus, countries have a social and political obligation to realize the “youth’s socially useful and at the same time self-satisfying development.”“Their development is not merely instrumental, even for those greater purposes to which totalitarian states are partial. Youth development is in and for them,” he said.“They must be educated for the times, kept healthy in present and improving conditions, and protected against the worst scourge of mankind: drugs and human trafficking which directly attack the meaning of what it is to be human,” Locsin said.He acknowledged the importance of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals as the “framework” of Philippine development plans.“We stress the urgency of reducing extreme poverty which is a drag in progress. It frustrates the moral imperative of universal action: so act that whatever you do is applied to you; summed up as all or none—no one advances at another’s expense,” Locsin said.The Philippines is committed to developing timely, comprehensive and disaggregated data to better grasp the situation of every citizen, especially the most marginalized, he added.Locsin noted that the Philippines lies inside a circle of fire and in the path of typhoons of increasing ferocity because of climate change.“We are continuously engaged in initiatives to address the varying challenges and threats; and to develop cooperation at all levels to reduce the human cost of natural disasters. Nature’s fury cannot be avoided but its worst can be managed,” he said.",1

"China is telling the US and North Korea to “hit the brakes” on threatening words and actions and work toward a peaceful resolution of their dispute, in a sign of growing concern over the standoff on the part of Pyongyang’s only major ally.Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that the two countries should work together to contain tensions and permit no one to “stir up an incident on their doorstep,” according to a statement posted on the Chinese foreign ministry’s website.“The most important task at hand is for the US and North Korea to ‘hit the brakes’ on their mutual needling of each other with words and actions, to lower the temperature of the tense situation and prevent the emergence of an `August crisis,”’ Wang was quoted as saying in the Tuesday conversation.The ministry quoted Lavrov as saying tensions could rise again with the US and South Korea set to launch large-scale military exercises on Aug. 21.“A resolution of the North Korea nuclear issue by military force is completely unacceptable and the peninsula’s nuclear issue must be peacefully resolved by political and diplomatic methods,” Lavrov was quoted as saying.China is North Korea’s main economic partner and political backer, although relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated amid the North’s continuing defiance of China’s calls for restraint. In recent months, China has joined with Russia in calling for the US to suspend annual military exercises with South Korea in exchange for Pyongyang halting its missile and nuclear tests as a first step toward direct talks.On Wednesday, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, continued a visit to China following talks the day before with his Chinese counterpart that touched on North Korea. No details of the talks have been released.Dunford on Tuesday told Fang Fenghui, chief of the People’s Liberation Army’s joint staff department, that the sides had “many difficult issues” between them but were willing to deal with them through dialogue.On Monday, Dunford was in Seoul to meet with senior South Korean military and political officials and the local media, seeking to ease anxiety while showing his willingness to back President Donald Trump’s warnings if need be.The US wants to peacefully resolve tensions with North Korea, but Washington is also ready to use the “full range” of its military capabilities, Dunford said. His visit to Asia, which also will include a stop in Japan, comes after Trump last week declared the US military “locked and loaded” and said he was ready to unleash “fire and fury” if North Korea continued to threaten the United States.During an inspection of the North Korean army’s Strategic Forces, which handles the missile program, Kim praised the military for drawing up a “close and careful plan” and said he would watch the “foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees” a little more before deciding whether to order the missile test, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.

"MANILA, Philippines – In a long list of Philippine chief executives including his own grandfather, Liberal Party (LP) standard-bearer Manuel Roxas II picked Benigno Aquino III as “the best president in Philippine history.”During a Town Hall forum organized by CNN Philippines recently, Roxas was asked who he thought was “the best president in Philippine history except for your grandfather.”“I would say Noynoy Aquino, undoubtedly,” said Roxas on Thursday, December 10, of the man who has endorsed his presidential bid for 2016.He added: “Undoubtedly, ang tawag sa 'tin ay sick man of Asia, para tayong lumpo, may sakit, hindi tayo nakakasabay sa ating mga kapitbahay na bansa. Ngayon, tawag sa 'tin, Asia's bright star. Malayo nang narating natin. Nagsimula lahat ito sa Daang Matuwid mula nung 2010. It's amazing what we can attain as a people, maglagay ng daang malinis at matuwid na pamunuan.”(We used to be called the sick man of Asia, we were a lame duck, we were sick, we weren’t at par with our neighbors. Now we’re called Asia’s bright star. We’ve come a long way and this started because of Daang Matuwid in 2010. It’s amazing what we can attain as a people, if your leaders follow the straight path.)Roxas was anointed by Aquino as his preferred successor when he steps down in 2016. He is also president-on-leave of the ruling party, which Aquino chairs. (READ: Aquino as 'minister mentor' under Roxas presidency?)Aquino and Roxas go a long way.

Vice President Binay is now seeking the presidency too.Six years later, it’s Roxas’ turn to vie for the presidency.

"Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana has asked military commanders in Marawi to clear the city of terrorists before President Rodrigo Duterte delivers his State of the Nation Address (Sona) before a joint session of Congress on July 24.Speaking to reporters on Monday, Lorenzana said he wanted the fighting to end before then so that Mr. Duterte could announce his plans for the rehabilitation of Marawi in his report to Congress.Lorenzana said 1,500 houses and buildings in the city still needed to be cleared of Maute terrorists and their Abu Sayyaf allies.“And at the rate of clearing of 70 to 100 houses per day, it will take them some time to clear the area,” he said.Hapilon hiding in mosqueAccording to Lorenzana, one of the leaders of the terrorists, Abu Sayyaf commander Isnilon Hapilon, who has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group in Iraq and Syria, is still in the city.“According to our latest information, he’s still inside Marawi. In fact, there is an information we got this morning that he’s hiding in one of the mosques there,” Lorenzana said.He said government informants had been watching for Hapilon’s arrival at the Abu Sayyaf stronghold on Basilan Island but had not seen him there.Hapilon was not among three fighters from Marawi who arrived in Basilan a week ago, Lorenzana said.“So, we believe that he is still in Marawi,” he added.Lorenzana said Basilan locals were providing information to the military about Hapilon.$5-M bounty“The Yakans know that there is a $5-million price on the head of Hapilon, and it’s very tempting for them also to give us accurate report on his whereabouts so that they will also, maybe get some of the money,” he said.The $5-million bounty is offered by the US government.Lorenzana said the military was having a hard time clearing Marawi of terrorists because the troops were used to jungle warfare, not to urban fighting.“This kind of problem is very difficult … it is urban fighting, which a lot of our troops there are not prepared … They are learning as they go along on how to fight in this built-up area,” he said.“If I were there, I would like the job to be finished immediately. [But] the enemy is also very wily and very resourceful,” he added.Lorenzana said the military had casualties from the 10th Infantry Battalion last week because the troops advanced in an effort to secure more ground without knowing there were still terrorists in some of the houses they left behind.“They were so aggressive to finish the job. They were able to go, go, go without knowing that the houses that they left behind still had (terrorists). So … they were shot in the back,” he said.“They had to go back and clear the houses again. So this is a big challenge. We have also to give maybe leeway to our troops to do what they want to do there,” he added.Malacañang said that as of July 2, 452 people had died in the fighting in Marawi, including 336 terrorists, 84 soldiers and policemen, and 32 civilians.Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said government troops had rescued 1,717 civilians and recovered 402 high-powered firearms.",1

"Patricia Paz “Tish” Bautista is the daughter of socialite Baby Cruz. Despite this, she has lived a “quiet, small life,” Bautista said.Patricia, 47, managed her mother’s Franck Provost salon chain and foundation. She is also into energy healing and aura reading, which is why socialites call her “weird and crazy,” she said.Talking to reporters on Friday, Patricia said she was aware she would be in the middle of a firestorm once her allegations of corruption against her husband, Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chair Andres Bautista, became public.“My whole objective is to have peace. This might be the most inefficient way to have a peaceful life but this seems to be the only recourse at this point. I just want to be with my children and just live in peace,” Patricia said.She is aware that she is the villain in the eyes of others, especially since she is also estranged from her own mother, she said.She said she knew she was accused of stealing someone else’s boyfriend and of straying.“People can’t blame me for everything. If they don’t get along, that is not my fault,” she said, referring to the high-profile couple whose breakup is being blamed on her.Patricia said it hurt her that she was estranged from her mother and that Cruz was even closer to her husband than her.Cruz declined to discuss why she was estranged from her daughter, although she said she was also hurting from the situation.Patricia does not deny that she reads people’s aura and does energy healing. It is a gift, she said, that she discovered after the death of her father some 20 years ago. She was a shy child, she said. And she was very close to her father.“I was very sad because I missed him. One time, shortly before my 25th birthday, I just kept hearing his voice and he was asking me what I wanted for my birthday. So I said, ‘I just want to be able to talk to him,’” Patricia said.Soon, she was able to develop her gift. Years later, she engaged in business related to energy healing. She became a business partner of the man a number of people insisted was her boyfriend.Before, Bautista kept quiet about Patricia’s rumored affair.

"moving forest fire burned through a mountainous area west of Athens on Monday, prompting residents to flee as smoke from the blaze turned the sky over the Greek capital a hazy orange.The fire department said 80 firefighters with 40 vehicles were on the scene near the seaside settlement of Kineta, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Athens between the capital and Corinth. Seven water-dropping planes and four helicopters were also helping to fight the wildfire.Authorities were sending 17 firefighting vehicles from across Greece to bolster forces already in the area, but strong winds with frequently shifting gusts were hampering firefighting efforts.Hours after the blaze began, flecks of ash swirled down onto central Athens.Three communities were being evacuated and the forest fire shut down a nearly 20-kilometer (13-mile) section on two highways linking the Peloponnese with central Greece. Thick smoke reduced visibility on the highway to mere meters (yards).Several houses were in flames, footage from the Greek TV station Skai showed. Some residents used garden hoses to try to save their properties, while others escaped in cars and on mopeds.It was not immediately clear how the fire started in the Geraneia mountains near Kineta.A separate wildfire broke out on the southern island of Crete, the fire department said, burning agricultural land and woodland. Two helicopters there were assisting dozens of firefighters.High temperatures of up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) have been predicted lately for Greece, and authorities have warned that the risk of forest fires is high.Forest fires are common in Greece during the hot, dry summers.

"‘Ballots for October polls good for next year’home/News/Nation/‘Ballots for October polls good for next year’THE Commission on Elections (Comelec) can still use the ballots intended for the barangay (village) and Sangguniang Kabataang (SK) polls next month if Congress decides to postpone it, Chairman Juan Andres Bautista said.Commissioner Rowena Guanzon disputed this, saying the ballots can no longer be used.Bautista pointed out that it has already been done in the past, and the Comelec may come out with a resolution stating that even if the ballots are for the October 23, 2017 barangay and SK elections, these can still be used at a later date.He explained that the village and youth polls would be done manually and are not as complicated as the automated elections.Bautista admitted that storing the ballots would be a challenge because these should be kept in a secure place to prevent tampering.“We can come out with a resolution for the purpose or we can ‘snowpake’ the ballots to change the date but it will entail a lot of expenses,” he said.But Guanzon said using “snowpake” to change the date on the ballots will affect the credibility of the elections.“The law requires the date to be printed on the ballot, Imagine a situation where Comelec personnel will snowpake the date one by one. Snowpake remedy will risk the credibility of the elections,” she added.Election lawyers George Garcia and Manuelito Luna agreed that the Comelec can legally use the ballots.Garcia noted that the law is specific on the date of elections on the ballot but he also pointed out that “the law gives Comelec greater latitude of discretion.”Luna said that since the barangay and SK elections will be done manually, the poll body can use the ballots at a later date so as not to waste government resources. “Legally, it is feasible for Comelec to do that,” he added.Some P6 billion has been allotted for the twin polls, including the printing of ballots and other paraphernalia and procurement of election materials.On August 14, the House of Representatives’ Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms approved a bill postponing the October 23 barangay and youth elections to May 2018.The Senate has yet to approve its version.",1
"LIBERAL Party’s vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo does not mind being the second choice of party standard-bearer Mar Roxas.In fact, the Camarines Sur Representative said it is an honor and privilege that Roxas considered her for the post despite her unpreparedness and lack of experience in national elections.“It doesn’t matter if I was the second choice or the last choice. Iyong pakiramdam na we have obligations bigger than ourselves, hindi mo na maiisip kung pang-ilang choice ka,” Robredo said in an interview with ANC on Thursday.Senator Grace Poe, who had consistently topped in preference surveys, was Roxas’ first choice but she turned down LP’s offer and decided to challenge Roxas in the presidential race.Robredo and Roxas made official their election run on the fourth day of the filing of candidacies at the Commission on Elections’ main office in Palacio del Gobernador, Intramuros, Manila.They filed their certificates of candidacy on the same day their tough rivals Poe and her running mate Senator Francis Escudero submitted their COCs.Stressing that she had no intention of running for higher office, Robredo said her being chosen was like scanning a food menu. “Ako ang huling makikita kasi walang balak na tumaas nang ganito,” she said.Raising low survey rankingRobredo also admitted that she will have to double her efforts to introduce herself to the people and raise her survey rankings to keep up with the vice presidential race.“Compared to all the other contenders, I have the least resource; ako iyong least popular. So talagang doble kayod. My numbers are still low. Kailangan talagang pagsipagan,” Robredo said.But asked what she could offer that other vice presidential aspirants do not have, Robredo said it would be her heart for the grassroots, which she shares with Roxas.“Palagay ko I will be a good match to Secretary Mar Roxas, kasi ang puso talaga sa grassroots nandoon…Totoong wala akong karanasan sa national politics pero palagay ko makakadagdag sa tandem naming dahil ako ang makakapagbigay ng local flavor,” she said.

"So Sen. Grace Poe Llamanzares (GPL) has been cleared to run for the presidency of the Philippines by the Philippine Supreme Court. We may not agree with the decision but I think it is time to move on. The majority of the gods of Padre Faura have spoken. Who cares if the clear text of the law and the weight of evidence against GPL shows that she cannot be considered as a natural born Filipino? GPL has won. Logic, as well as the sanctity of the Constitution, has lost.Fr. Rannie Aquino, Dean of the San Beda Law School, clearly explained the simple logic behind why GPL ought not to be considered a natural born Filipino, therefore not qualified to run for the Presidency. He states:To be President of the Philippines, one must be a natural-born Filipino. Therefore: Owing to the necessity of the requirement, the very possibility that a candidate is not a natural-born Filipino should be excluded. Under the 1935 Constitution, one was natural-born only if one was born of a Filipino father. (For purposes relevant to the present discussion). Ms. Poe is POSSIBLY natural-born, but AS POSSIBLY not natural-born, precisely because she is a foundling. A foundling is one whose parentage is unknown and whose birth circumstances are unknown, who is found, as an infant. Since one cannot argue from POSSIBILITY (she is possibly a natural-born Filipino) to NECESSITY (she is necessarily a natural-born Filipino), then she does not comply with the requirement of the Constitution.How the “brilliant” nine gods of Padre Faura missed this simple logic is anybody’s guess. Perhaps this is not a matter of logic but simply a matter of emotions trumping logic. This seems to be very evident in how Chief Justice Sereno has argued her seeming inclination during the argument period. She stated:“If we rule against the rights of foundlings, will there be a disincentive?…“There are more parents who want to adopt. More times they do not understand the problems. What this court will say will speak to them how we view the constitutional duty, that the language is silent so that the rights of foundlings are completely silent…”Never mind the big red herring in her argument when she magically shifted the original issue of the constitutionality of GPL’s candidacy for the presidency to the rights of foundlings. (Would someone now argue for the rights of those who cannot read or write and those who are 39 years old and below, as the Constitution seems to be discriminatory of their rights to run as the Chief Executive of the country as well?) Let us focus on how the emotional argument has all of a sudden trumped the clear text and intent of the law.The problem with interpreting the law based on emotion, popular sentiment, or any shades of Argumentum ad misericordiam, is that it opens the gate for treating the Constitution as a living document. One of the biggest criticism of treating the Constitution as a living document is being prone to seek legislation from the bench. In this case of the Constitutionality of GPL’s candidacy, the Court effectively changed the law on citizenship. Such function rests with the legislature, not the judiciary. Surely the law can be changed through amendments but such changes have to be done through the proper process, through the legislature. This certainly looks like a case of judicial overreach where an arbitrary intervention is made by the judiciary into the legislature’s domain. This is certainly a case of judicial activism.One may argue that the Supreme Court did not overreach but merely performed its judicial review duty. But the Court’s authority for judicial review is to examine an executive act (or legislative act) and to invalidate that act if it is contrary to constitutional principles. When assessing an act according to constitutional principles it is important to look back at the original intent of the law. I think the late SCOTUS Justice Antonin Scalia offered the best argument (as described by Judge Andrew Napolitano):Justice Scalia argued that the Constitution means what it says; it says it is the supreme law of the land; and all American judges have taken a solemn oath to be subject to what it says. It is superior to the jurists who interpret it. It is what it says, not as they might wish it say. Thus, all judges are bound by the text. Hence the word “textualism.” So “no law” means no law. “Due process” guarantees fair process, not substance. A constitutional guarantee is a real guarantee. The exercise of rights articulated in the Constitution cannot be subject to popularity contests. If the text of the Constitution is ambiguous, it then becomes the duty of the jurist to ascertain the original public meaning of the words that form the ambiguity. Hence the word “originalism.” Ascertaining original public meaning often requires the skills of a historian; yet, thanks to James Madison, the historical record is ample. The rejection of this line of thinking permits jurists to interpret the Constitution in novel and creative or even destructive ways, according to their own ideologies. It permits them to adapt a meaning in the text that they wish had been there to fortify contemporary societal attitudes. Justice Scalia argued that that is not the job of jurists. Federal judges have life tenure because they represent the anti-democratic part of the federal government. Their job is to preserve constitutional norms and structures and guarantees from interference by the popular branches of the federal government or the States, even when those branches or the States command popular support. The job of the jurist, he argued, is not to adapt the text of the Constitution to public trends or cultural changes. That is the job of the Congress and the States through legislation.In the Philippine setting, the same principle has appeared time and again. In 2012, there was an issue regarding what seemed like a Constitutional ambiguity regarding congressional membership on the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC). The issue back then was whether Congressman Tupas should be part of the JBC together with Senator Escudero as the Constitution states that a member of Congress shall sit as a member of the JBC. (The Philippines has two chambers of Congress – the Lower House where Tupas belongs and the Upper House where Escudero belongs.) The Court ruled that having both Tupas and Escudero sit as members of the JBC is unconstitutional. It arrived at this ruling by looking at the original intent of the law, citing the 1986 constitutional deliberations to demonstrate the intent of the framers. How come this principle in interpreting the Constitution was suddenly abandoned for the privileged GPL?Yes, GPL’s counsel tried to argue for her case using excerpts from the 1934 Constitutional Convention regarding the natural born citizenship status of foundlings hoping to convince the Court that the intent of the framers of the 1935 Constitution was to treat foundlings as natural born citizens. But his argument was a clear misrepresentation of the collective intent of the framers! In fact, the proposed amendment favoring natural born status to foundlings was put to a vote and was rejected. The fact that it was discussed and voted upon does not mean that the framers collectively intended to favor foundlings such as GPL regarding natural born status. The fact that the proposal lost the vote means that the prevailing original intent of the majority of the framers did not support GPL’s case.This landmark ruling by the Philippine Supreme Court may give a very chilling effect on the way the Constitution is regarded. The moment the Philippine Supreme Court ruled in favor of GPL, the solemn oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution has lost its meaning to the prevailing winds of politics and the whims of emotion.[Top image taken from buzzle.com.]",0
"Activists and families of eight victims of President Duterte’s brutal war on drugs filed a complaint on Tuesday in the International Criminal Court (ICC), a second petition accusing the Philippine leader of murder and crimes against humanity.But the filing of the complaint—formally referred to as communication—did not bother Malacañang, which said it meant nothing.“That’s not a complaint. That’s a communication because it’s still to be acted upon by the ICC. Procedure is different,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque told reporters.“Anyone can file a communication. Even the Pope has a communication filed against him. So that doesn’t mean anything,” Roque said.Extrajudicial killingsThe 50-page complaint calls for Mr. Duterte’s indictment for what it describes as thousands of extrajudicial killings, which include “brazen” executions by police acting with impunity.Critics of Mr. Duterte’s fierce crackdown on narcotics were being “persecuted,” it said, and cases filed by the victims’ families had gone nowhere.The ICC petition follows a similar complaint filed in April 2017 by lawyer Jude Josue Sabio, into which the ICC in February started a preliminary examination.The latest move is led by Rise Up for Life, a network of activists, priests and members of the urban poor communities that have borne the brunt of the war on drugs.The complaint includes testimony from six relatives of eight people killed by police:Irma J. Locasia, mother of Salvador J. Locasia Jr., killed by police in an operation on Aug. 31, 2016Dennise B. David, father of John Jezreel T. David, killed by officers on Jan. 20, 2017Maria C.B. Lozano, sister of Crisanto and Juan Carlos B. Lozano, both killed in a police operation on May 12, 2017Mariel F. Sabangan, sister of Bernabe F. Sabangan, killed by police together with Arnold S. Vitales on May 15, 2017Normita B. Lopez, mother of Djastin B. Lopez, killed by officers on May 18, 2017Purisima B. Dacumos, wife of Danilo G. Dacumos, killed by officers on Aug. 3, 2017.‘Personally liable’“Duterte is personally liable for ordering state police to undertake mass killings,” Neri Colmenares, a lawyer from the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) that represents the group, told reporters at a media forum held at the United Churches of Christ Chapel in Quezon City, moments after he said the complaint was filed in the ICC on Tuesday morning.Mr. Duterte says he has told the police to kill only if their lives were in danger.In his annual address to a joint session of Congress last month, he said the war on drugs would be as “relentless and chilling” as its first two years.The Philippine National Police says the more than 4,400 killed over that time were dealers who had all resisted arrest, and denies activists’ allegations of cover-ups and executions of drug users.Roque said on Tuesday the latest ICC petition was “doomed,” and “would not prosper,” because of the “concept of complementarity.”The ICC cannot act on the latest petition against Mr. Duterte unless domestic courts were “unable or unwilling to exercise jurisdiction,” he said.The ICC prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment and could not be reached out of normal office hours.Rome Statute pulloutAfter ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced the preliminary examination of the first complaint against Mr. Duterte in February, the Philippine leader unilaterally withdrew the Philippines from the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding treaty, in March, saying the court had not followed due process and presumption of his innocence, in actions that were compounded by “baseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks” by UN officials.It was a stark contrast from the previous 18 months, when the former mayor of Davao City had repeatedly dared the ICC to investigate him and expressed his readiness to go on trial in The Hague.The Supreme Court opened oral arguments later on Tuesday in a separate complaint by some opposition lawmakers challenging the legality of Mr. Duterte’s withdrawal of the Philippines from the Rome Statute, which was done without Senate approval.Not protectedJurist groups say Mr. Duterte is not protected from an indictment, because the ICC’s jurisdiction covers the period of membership, which in the Philippines’ case is from 2011 to March 2019, when the withdrawal takes effect.In the complaint, the NUPL said the notice of withdrawal was of no moment and did not deprive the ICC of jurisdiction because the communication was filed while the Philippines was a party to the Rome Statute.Mass murderThe ICC’s taking jurisdiction, the NUPL said, “may force President Duterte to reexamine, if not abandon, his distorted notion of mass murder to solve the country’s drug and crime problem.”It said ICC intervention could “save thousands more from slaughter.”The ICC is a court of last resort that can exercise jurisdiction if states are unable or unwilling to investigate crimes.Senior Supt. Benigno Durana, a spokesperson for the PNP, said on Tuesday that the only order Mr. Duterte gave to police was “to wage war on drugs and criminality within the bounds of the law.”",1
"TWO days before the State of the Nation Address (SONA) of President Rodrigo Duterte, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Director Dante Gierran recommended the prosecution of several officials of the National Printing Office (NPO) led by its Deputy Director Sherwin Prose Castañeda over the controversial issuance of work orders to private printing companies. In a letter to the Office of the Ombudsman, the NBI Anti-Fraud Division recommended the filing of charges against Castañeda, former NPO officer-in-charge Rolando Caluag, Myralyn Soriano, retired NPO employee Ruben Dancel; Edwin Malapajo, vice president of Western Visayas Printing Corporation; Bestforms Inc. president Benjamin Yam, Triprint Corp. president Ramil Tamayo and Metrocolor Corp. general manager Celso Viray. “They committed violation of Republic Act No. 3019 otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act,” stated in the NBI letter to Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales signed by Deputy Dir.

The press conference of self-confessed hitman SPO3 Arthur Lascanas is part of a protracted political drama aimed to destroy the President and to topple his administration. Our people are aware that this character assassination is nothing but vicious politics orchestrated by sectors affected by the reforms initiated by the Duterte administration. The Commission on Human Rights, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Senate Committee on Justice already cleared the President of extrajudicial killing and his involvement in the Davao Death Squad. Bringing change is not an easy task. The Duterte administration has disturbed/disrupted the establishment. However, we remain undistracted in delivering goods and services to serve the people, not just the interest of the few.Webb: Can I ask you a question now?Andanar: Yes, go ahead ma’am.Webb: Secretary, tinatawag niyo po itong demolition job, political job on character assassination, may plano po ba ang Malakanyang or yung Office of the President kay SPO3 Arthur Lascanas dahil sa kanyang mga sinabi?Andanar: Well, si SPO3 Lascanas ay kakatapos lang po ng kanyang presscon kani-kanina lamang and ang gobyerno, ang administrasyong Duterte sa pangunguna din po ng ating Secretary Aguirre ay sasagot din po in a matter of time.

"Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), the influential Christian sect, ended five days of protest on Monday morning after reaching a “mutual understanding” with the government that the rule of law should be upheld.The Inquirer learned that high-level government officials and top INC leaders, aided by a “highly credible intermediary” from the private sector, met through the wee hours and ironed out problems caused by the filing of a criminal complaint by an expelled INC minister against members of the sect’s governing council.A highly placed source told the Inquirer that the two sides agreed that the complaint should go through the legal process, after which the INC officials decided to lift a four-day-old blockade of Edsa, Metro Manila’s main highway.INC general evangelist Bienvenido Santiago announced the end of the protest on the sect’s television network Net25 at 8:15 a.m.“INC and the government have met and in this discussion, the two parties have explained their sides and so it is all peaceful now,” Santiago said.“This peaceful gathering that we started on Thursday afternoon will end also peacefully this Monday morning,” he said.The one-minute announcement shown on five LED screens set up at the Edsa-Shaw Boulevard intersection in Mandaluyong City was followed by loud cheers and thunderous applause from 18,000 INC followers who had been alerted toward midnight to an expected resolution of the protest.After the announcement, INC spokesman Edwil Zabala instructed the followers to leave the intersection peacefully and collect their trash.Malacañang confirmed reports of the meeting between government and INC officials, but declined to disclose the results of the talks.Deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte told reporters that the meeting “gave both sides an opportunity to clarify issues and concerns.”No dealValte stressed that “there was no deal struck as some insinuate.”Valte did not say when or where the meeting took place and who were present from both sides.A highly placed source told the Inquirer that INC executive minister Eduardo V. Manalo was at the meeting.Presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda did not answer questions about the meeting, saying he “was not privy to the discussions” between the two sides.Lacierda, however, said a meeting was held at the Palace on Sunday night for a discussion of the INC protest.“The meeting with [President Aquino] last night started at around 8:30 and ended a little past midnight,” Lacierda said, adding that “matters discussed were ongoing developments on the status of the INC rally on Edsa and postexpiration permit scenarios.”Among those who attended the meeting were Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin, Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, Social Welfare Secretary Corazon Soliman, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Hernando Iriberri and Philippine National Police chief Director General Ricardo Marquez.Lacierda and Valte were also at the meeting.In a statement, Lacierda neither confirmed nor denied reports that a meeting between government and INC officials had taken place.But he indicated that the two sides had reached an understanding and that “through goodwill and the convergence of efforts, the rule of law has been upheld.”Lacierda attributed the resolution of the INC protest to “diplomacy,” which he described as an “important tool in avoiding unintended consequences.”Discreet gov’t moveRoxas, who oversees the PNP, also announced the resolution of the INC protest that started in front of the Department of Justice (DOJ) building on Padre Faura Street in Manila on Thursday.He said the INC protesters lifted their blockade of Edsa after the government discreetly spoke with leaders of the sect.“The government quietly communicated with the INC leaders during the past few days. It was an opportunity to clarify the issue,” Roxas said in a statement.“There were many who wanted to exploit the protest for their personal ends. It was important that everybody remained calm to avoid violence,” he added, without elaborating.Earlier, Roxas confirmed reports that certain people were trying to agitate the INC leaders and followers who were demanding the resignation of De Lima for giving “special attention” to the complaint filed by expelled INC minister Isaias Samson Jr. against members of the sect’s governing council.Among the people seen at the Edsa protest were Jose “Peping” Cojuangco, an uncle of President Aquino, and his wife, former Tarlac Gov. Margarita “Tingting” Cojuangco, who lost a run for the Senate as an opposition candidate in 2013, and Council of Philippine Affairs head Pastor Saycon.The Cojuangcos and Saycon are known supporters of Vice President Jejomar Binay, the opposition’s presidential candidate in next year’s national elections.Roxas did not refer to any agreement between the government and the Iglesia sides, but a source close to the sect said the government told INC leaders that the DOJ would proceed with the preliminary investigation of Samson’s complaint but would drop it for lack of probable cause.The source said Ronald Llamas, the presidential adviser on political affairs, served as intermediary between President Aquino and Roxas and Santiago, Manalo’s point man.Two versionsThere are two versions of how the discussions between the two sides went.According to an INC member who had links to the sect’s leadership, President Aquino ordered Roxas to call the INC central headquarters in the early hours of Monday.Roxas spoke to Santiago and they reached an agreement, the source said.The source said this was the only information that the INC head office was willing to confirm to its members.According to the other version, which reached the camp of Samson, Santiago was taken to Malacañang to meet with Aquino and Roxas hours after the President’s emergency meeting with his Cabinet and the PNP.In that meeting, Santiago insisted on forcing De Lima to resign and for the DOJ to dismiss Samson’s complaint immediately.According to the source, Roxas countered with a threat to charge the INC leaders with inciting to sedition if they did not recall their followers from Edsa by Monday morning.Roxas’ camp, however, said he was never involved in the negotiations.The two sides eventually agreed to save face through a compromise: the DOJ would proceed to investigate Samson’s complaint but drop it for lack of probable cause, the source said.Samson complained that he was illegally detained, a criminal case that could lead to the arrest of some INC officials.The complaint stemmed from infighting over the use of funds that the sect’s leaders insisted was an internal matter and the government should not interfere.To save themselves from a humiliating arrest, the INC leaders called for a mass action, but stepped back when reminded that businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles, the alleged brains behind the P10-billion pork barrel scam, went to jail after she was convicted for illegally detaining Benhur Luy, the principal witness in the case.–Jerry E.

"More Pinoys favor divorce – SWShome/News/Nation/More Pinoys favor divorce – SWSMore Filipinos support legalizing divorce in the country, especially those with live-in partners, according to the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey.The poll, conducted on December 8 to 16, 2017, showed an average 53 percent of adult Filipinos nationwide agree with the statement, “Married couples who have already separated and cannot reconcile anymore should be allowed to divorce so that they can get legally married again.”Thirty-two percent disagreed with the statement while 15 percent were undecided resulting in a net agreement score of +21, classified as “moderately strong.”SWS noted that support for legalization of divorce was “very strong” among women with live-in partners (+44), men with live-in partners (+37) and widowed or separated men (+33).“Support for the legalization of divorce used to be split when SWS first surveyed it in 2005: 43 percent agreed, 12 percent were undecided, and 45 percent disagreed, for a neutral net agreement of -2,” the polling firm said.“The question was asked for the second time six years after in 2011 and obtained moderately strong support. When it was asked for the third time three years after in 2014, it went to very strong and stayed at moderately strong up to 2017,” it added.In terms of geography, support for divorce was strongest in Metro Manila at +35 (“very strong”).Support from the rest of Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao was “moderately strong” at +23, +14 and +15, respectively.For religious groups, support was strongest for Catholics at +23, followed by other Christians at +12.Members of the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ) felt “neutral” about it at -8.SWS said although it interviewed Muslims, the results were not relevant as divorce is legal under Shari’ah Law.The survey was conducted using face-to-face interviews of 1,200 adults, aged 18 years old and above, nationwide.It has a margin of error of ±3 percent nationwide, ±4 percent for Luzon, and ±6 percent each for Metro Manila, Visayas and Mindanao.The survey results were disclosed after the House Committee on Population and Family Relations approved on February 20 a measure that would allow divorce in the Philippines.Under the bill, married couples may end their marriage for several reasons, including abuse, infidelity and irreconcilable differences.The proposed measure also allows spouses separated for at least five years to file for absolute divorce.No divorce bill has been proposed at the Senate.At present, the Family Code of the Philippines provides two ways for couples to separate.First is legal separation, which allows spouses to split up, but not to remarry.Second is annulment, which allows spouses to remarry because the marriage is considered invalid from the start.",1

"(Second of five parts)ALL THE NINE cases cited Friday in the first part of this series on breached contracts are devastating in their negative impact on the community. But it would be good to start with the Metro Rail Transit 3 (MRT 3) given its prominence today and a fast and easy solution at hand—before a train falls off its worn-out rails onto Edsa and kills many.The correct action is to give the maintenance contract back to Sumitomo and Mitsubishi which have proven their ability to do the job. No need for an open bidding, no search for the cheapest, just a choice of the companies proven to be competent.An open bidding is the kind of simple mind-set that leads to more problems than it solves. To choose the cheapest option makes good sense—if, and the stress is on if, all other factors are equal. They rarely are.A cheap commodity is likely to be of low quality. You get what you pay for. A good analogy here is LED light bulbs. A cheap bulb looks just as good as an expensive, well-branded one and gives just as much light. But after a couple of years the light output of a cheap bulb dims (an expensive one doesn’t), and its life is much shorter. It’s more difficult to take in all the factors of quality, of service, of reliability, of adherence to promised deliverables, etc.In choosing the cheapest option here, the government ended up with a disaster on its hands.MTR Corp., which efficiently runs the Hong Kong railway system, was asked to do an asset audit of MRT 3. Here are some of its frightening (and understated) observations:“Of all the systems surveyed, the track condition is most alarming and requires immediate attention. There is insufficient stock for replacement. Machine rail grinding is also not done. In fact, the running speed was restricted to 40 kilometers per hour from 65 kph to reduce the safety risk posed to the passengers. It can potentially cause train derailment leading to substantial casualties in a high-usage system like MRT 3. The lack of remediation will make those defects become more severe.”“The rolling stock asset condition is unsatisfactory. Traction motors have exhibited the most failures and it should be reviewed if overhaul or full replacement would be required. (On June 1, the first day of school, only seven trains were running. This is one-third the usual 20 trains that should operate during peak hours).”“The wheel lathe and all track maintenance vehicles are out of order. The tamping machine and ballast machine, which are used for rail track maintenance, are out of order.”“The reliability of the door system and ATP (automatic train protection) equipment also needs to be improved. Failure of door systems could be disastrous as all train doors should be closed before a train starts to move and remain closed all the time. There should be a fail-safe design with no single point of failure.”“The physical and operating condition in the signal equipment room is poor. There is obsolescence of key components. A system replacement can be considered. The PABX system is working at full capacity and toward end of life.”“The three weeks interval between scheduled regular maintenance is too wide apart. Maintenance is a task based without addressing the need to replace critical or obsolete parts and subsystems in a timely manner.”Failures increasedIt’s a litany of failure after failure, of total incompetence in managing a system—all because the government wanted to “save” a few cents.Another key finding of MTR Corp. was that the incidence of failures rapidly increased during the past two years when the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) suddenly kicked out Sumitomo and Mitsubishi in 2012. The DOTC replaced Sumitomo with a hastily organized firm with no qualifications and insufficient capital.The latest “solution” was to hire seven different companies on six-month renewable contracts to do different parts of the maintenance work. This is absurd. You don’t give short-term contracts to different entities to handle a complex process.Just two things: (1) You need to hire and train specialized technicians who are experts in their assigned functions, and (2) you need to purchase substantial stocks of spare parts to handle not only regular maintenance, but also to cover for unexpected breakdowns. Neither of these two things can be properly accomplished with short-term contracts.Simple solutionYou also do not break service up. What’s needed is an overall single contractor in charge, who may subcontract some specialized work—but not seven independently assigned contractors. Rail systems are heavily dependent on “preventive” maintenance rather than “reactive” maintenance.The solution is blindingly simple: Give the maintenance and operation back to Sumitomo at whatever cost. It will be far, far cheaper than whatever is being “saved” by the government right now.The worst thing that could happen is for these seven companies to take over the entire operation, as has been proposed through a P54-billion buyout of MRT Holdings, the private firm that runs the train system.It was also disclosed during the last Senate hearing on MRT 3 that the P54-billion budget that the DOTC and the Department of Finance proposed would only go to Development Bank of the Philippines and Land Bank of the Philippines, and not a single centavo to the owner, MRT Holdings. This means not a single centavo will be spent on the train system itself.The government, regardless of who is in charge, has proven itself massively inept at running something like a rail line.",1
"SEN. Vicente Sotto 3rd wants to amend the Dangerous Drugs Act by not requiring anymore drug depen­dents to seek court order to be admitted in government-run rehabilitation centers.He filed on December 5 Senate Bill (SB) 1628 that aims to streamline the process for the admission of drug dependents in government drug rehabilitation facilitiesSB 1628 amends Section 3, 54, 77 and 81 of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 to achieve this purpose.Sotto noted that with the full implementation of the Duterte administration’s war on drugs, thousands of users are voluntary submitting themselves to reform and undergo drug rehabilitation treatment.“However, one of the challenges faced by the surge of these drug users or dependents is the delay in the process of admission for treatment in government facilities,” he said.“To streamline this process, this bill aims to require that the petition for voluntary confinement be a non-litigious matter before the Dangerous Drugs Board [DDB],” Sotto added.SB 1628 intends to amend Section 77 of RA 9165 that mandates the DDB to refer to the court any application for rehabilitation from drug dependents. The court will then order the applicant be examined for drug dependency.Sotto wants to cut the long process before a drug dependent be admitted to a government-run rehabilitation center.However, the bill also provides that “the applicant shall bear the treatment and rehabilitation costs if he or she opted to be treated in a private rehabilitation center.”Sotto said that in the Philippines, “there is a stigma that a known user of prohibited drugs is deemed as a continuing nuisance to the society.”According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, like other chronic diseases, addiction can be managed successfully.Treatment enables people to counteract addiction’s powerful disruptive effects on the brain and behavior and to regain control of their lives, Sotto said.“Under our Constitution, it is our policy of the State to protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them,” he added.",1
"Vice President Leni Robredo is very busy these days.When she is not blabbering about rebuilding Marawi City or criticizing Chinese-funded infrastructure projects like the Bicol Express, Robredo is launching projects aimed at improving the health of Filipino children.Well, it’s that time of year when kids go trick or treating, making the rounds of their neighborhoods collecting chocolates and candies to fill their Halloween buckets.Today, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) announced that it was launching Leni’s Halugaween Project. It encourages adults to dispense of the usual chocolate and candy treats and instead go for packets of lugaw.”This will ensure that our Filipino kids are well nourished especially during the holiday season,” Robredo told The Adobo Chronicles.Lugaw, anyone?",0

"The government should bridge the disparity in cancer treatment for rich and poor patients given the skyrocketing cost of cancer care and medication.The suggestion was made on Tuesday by Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara, who had filed Senate Bill (SB) 1570, or the National Integrated Cancer Control Act, which seeks to make cancer treatment and care more affordable for all Filipinos.SB 1570 provides for a P30-billion cancer assistance fund to support the medical and treatment assistance program for cancer patients, especially those who belong to the most vulnerable sectors of society.“Treating cancer isn’t cheap. The average cost for a year’s worth of treatment could run into hundreds of thousands to millions of pesos,” Angara said.Because of the high cost, he noted, people with advanced cancer turn down recommended care while other cancer patients and their families use up all or most of their savings to pay for treatment.It is high time the government come up with an integrated and comprehensive approach to bridge the divide between rich and poor cancer patients, Angara said.“We need to develop a system in which all people with cancer have access to high-quality and affordable cancer treatments,” he added.The senator said cancer is a complex and catastrophic disease that is an urgent public health concern as he pressed for patients’ increased access to drugs for cancer treatment and expanded coverage for preventive and diagnostic services.He raised the need to institutionalize a systematic, well-organized, well-coordinated and well-funded, patient- and family-centered integrated cancer control programs at all levels of the existing health care delivery system.Angara also noted that many of the medical advances that allow cancer patients to live longer come at a high cost, and chemotherapy is one of the most expensive parts of treatment.Other cancer care expenses include doctor and clinic visits, radiation treatments, imaging tests like X-rays and MRIs, hospital stays, surgery and home care, he said.SB 1570 also seeks to expand current benefits from the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. or PhilHealth to include screening, detection, diagnosis, treatment assistance, palliative and supportive care, survivorship follow-up care and rehabilitation.This expansion covers all types and stages of cancer of patients regardless of age.",1
"US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer faulted President Donald Trump’s agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday as short on details, saying Trump gave up “substantial leverage” in ongoing talks over Pyongyang’s nuclear program.Some Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials have said any agreement with North Korea would be submitted as a treaty needing approval by two-thirds of the U.S. Senate, meaning it would need significant support from among Schumer’s fellow Democrats to be enacted.",1

Delima.Drilon, Aquino, and Pangilinan are all in the same political party while Hontiveros is their close ally.SponsorAquino said the fact that he was replaced had nothing to do with his performance as committee chairman.“If this is the price to pay for showing up at the streets of EDSA, for talking about democracy, if this is the price to pay, I’d gladly pay the price,” Aquino said.LP leader Senator Franklin Drilon was also removed as Senate President Pro Tempore and was replaced by Ralph Recto with 17 votes out of 23 senators.

"Get ready for another long “holiday.”Three special nonworking days after a weekend next month make for one of the longest “holidays” before the Christmas season in Metro Manila and two provinces.President Rodrigo Duterte has declared Nov. 13-15 (Monday to Wednesday) special nonworking days in Metro Manila, Bulacan and Pampanga as the country will be hosting the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit.Earlier, Metro Manila mayors decided to suspend classes in all levels on Nov. 16 and 17.Metro Manila and the two provinces will enjoy the special nonworking days since these areas will be directly affected by Asean activities, according to Proclamation No. 332, which the President signed on Monday.“Various activities directly connected with (the summit), to be attended by Asean leaders and Asean dialogue partners, will be held in the NCR (National Capital Region) and Clark Field, Pampanga,” Mr. Duterte said.World leadersFrom Nov. 10 to 14, leaders and top diplomats from the 10-nation regional bloc will hold meetings in Manila and Clark in Pampanga province.Other world leaders, like US President Donald Trump and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, are expected to attend the summit.While the summit will end on Nov. 14, Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista said his counterparts decided to suspend classes in all levels since thousands of delegates were expected to tour Metro Manila after the event.Bautista said, however, that work in both government and private offices were not suspended on those days.The special nonworking days will come after the nationwide jeepney strike on Oct. 16 and 17, during which work and classes were suspended, and the All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day.Classes were earlier suspended on several occasions in Metro Manila and nearby areas due to heavy rains and flooding.",1
"ORGANIZED labor has sought a legislative probe of all aspects of operations of the Social Security System (SSS) amid a controversy hounding the state pension fund that raised doubts on the integrity of private workers’ money.The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) made the call on Wednesday, saying the fund is facing a crisis of credibility triggered by the stock market placement controversy involving four ranking officials of the SSS.TUCP spokesman Vicente Camilon Jr. said of paramount importance is protection of the fund that comes from contributions of 34.6 million SSS members.In House Resolution 1482 filed by TUCP Rep. Raymond Mendoza, the labor group asked the House Committee on Banks and Financial Intermediaries to look into the operations of the SSS in response to the alarm raised in the controversy on the allegedly questionable purchase of shares of stock in the open market by the four officials of the pension fund amid efforts to increase premium contribution from workers.“Workers are concerned that the intramurals among SSS high officials might be compromising the fund and endangering the future of SSS members,” Mendoza said, adding that there is an immediate need to assure that workers’ funds are not only intact but, more important, not in the hands of crooks.The TUCP reiterated its strong objection to the proposal to raise the monthly contribution of SSS members from 11 percent to 12.5 percent in order to sustain the fund and to be able to provide more benefits to SSS members.It said SSS officials should first strengthen their collection mechanisms and go after errant employers rather than raising the contribution of workers.The congressman countered the SSS’ assertions that they are running after non-compliant companies, saying the prevailing corporate culture within the pension is laxity in filing cases against erring employers.“Workers believe that the real problem is the non-remittance by employers of collected workers’ money as contributions which the SSS must resolve first before proposing any addition to members’ contribution as a last resort to sustain its operations and meet its future obligations, and that a heroic effort to go after employers guilty of non-remittance may already address the financing required to maintain the life of the fund,” Mendoza said.The TUCP refuted the SSS’ assertion that the passage of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion exempting low-income taxpayers from Personal Income Tax will make it affordable for workers to make additional contributions to the SSS.",1
"In the Disney animated film, ‘Frozen,’ Queen Elsa is seen singing the Oscar Award-winning song ‘Let It Go’ atop a mountain as she builds her ice castle in which she was to live her life in isolation.Most moviegoers believe she was singing the song to herself with an admonition to let go of everything she had, including her beloved sister Anna and her entire kingdom.But that was not in the original script.The Adobo Chronicles has just obtained a copy of the deleted scene which had the original segment of ‘Let It Go.” It appears that the film director opted to re-shoot the segment to what is now included in the film’s final cut.In the deleted scene, Queen Elsa encountered a wood frog, freezing almost to death and clinging to a tree branch. The frog was so afraid about falling into the snow-covered ground. Apparently, Queen Elsa was singing the song not to herself but to the wood frog, telling it to let go and that it would be just fine if it did fall to the ground.The original script’s message about the deleted scene was: people (and frogs) need to let go of their fears and not to be scared about venturing into unchartered territory.Disney refused to comment on why it decided to edit out and replace the deleted scene. It simply responded to our reporter with, “Let It Go!”",0
"Philippine Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) chief Renato Solidum has welcomed the proposed immediate creation of a Department of Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM), saying it would greatly reduce the estimated 48,000 loss of lives in Metro Manila and nearby provinces in case a 7.2-magnitude earthquake or the so-called “Big One” hits Manila.Speaking during the third Disaster Resilience Conference for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) and Senior Citizens sponsored by SM Cares, the corporate social responsibility arm of SM Supermalls in partnership with Phivolcs and Metro Manila Development Authority, at the Mall of Asia, Solidum said the creation of a department on DRRM was long overdue considering that the Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world.President Duterte has called on Congress to create the proposed department.“We have long been in discussion to elevate the matter of DRRM to a department level because R.A. 10121 or the Philippine DRRM Act is under review. The country is prone to various disasters. Aside from rescue and response, we should also focus on disaster mitigation, preparedness, prevention efforts so those who will be affected will be fewer,” Solidum said.Solidum had said the “Big One” could strike anytime.Having a Department of DRRM, he pointed out, will expand the focus to include disaster preparedness and mitigation which will not only be more cost-effective but will save lives and properties.“There would be more concerted effort and there will be people whose focus will only be on DRRM and not only on search and rescue,” he said.He pointed out that if nothing was done to prepare for the so-called Big One, an estimated 48,000 people would die in Metro Manila and nearby provinces.He added that many of those who would perish would be PWDs and senior citizens because of their physical limitations and personality vulnerabilities.",1
"Vice President Leni Robredo has no time to waste on “trolls” and her detractors on social media.“I have no message for them because I think it’s a lost cause. It’s a lost cause in the sense that they don’t know me, but they have already made a judgment,” she said in a television interview aired on Friday morning.Asked on GMA News TV to address her critics, the Vice President said there was no point in trying to reach out to those who had closed their minds about her.“Their judgment is not coming from people who know me personally. Perhaps I can give a message to those who have open minds, but most of them have closed their minds, so there’s no point in wasting time on them,” Robredo said.Target of vitriolSince quitting the Cabinet in December over differences with President Duterte, Robredo, the interim chair of the Liberal Party, has become the target of vitriol by the President’s army of online supporters, including Mocha Uson, a former show biz starlet who now runs a pro-administration blog.Constructive criticismThough dismissive of those who had made up their minds about her, Robredo said she was thankful to the people who gave her the benefit of the doubt.“Those with open minds are the ones whose comments matter to us, because it allows us to look at ourselves when we commit mistakes,” she said.“It’s also not right to keep getting praise when we are doing wrong,” Robredo said.Mr. Duterte’s supporters have ratcheted up their attacks on the widow of Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo since she left his Cabinet in December.Robredo resigned her post as housing czar after she had been told via text message to stop attending Cabinet meetings.Mr. Duterte said he had received reports that Robredo was joining ouster rallies.She denied this. In fact, what the Vice President attended was a Bantayog ng mga Bayani event honoring martial law heroes.Robredo, who has since expressed her intention to become the voice of the opposition, has been criticized by Uson and other haters for, among other things, her magazine covers and her vacation in the United States at the height of a typhoon that hit the Bicol region.Accusations of luxuryRecently, a pro-Duterte blog accused her of living a life of luxury after she had a photo taken with her “personal yoga trainer.”It was later learned that the training was part of a fitness program for the staff of the Office of the Vice President.Robredo has generally shrugged off the online hate, saying she has not even read Uson’s blog.“I would have to admit that I have not read her blog and I don’t intend to read it,” she said at an Inquirer forum in December.A few weeks earlier, her office had been compelled to address vicious rumors on Facebook that she was pregnant, saying it was part of a “well-funded demolition campaign” against her.",1
"Widespread flooding in Thailand’s south has killed 21 people, hit rubber production in the region and shut down infrastructure, officials said on Monday, as the military government increased aid to flood-affected areas.Thailand’s wet season usually ends in late November and heavy rain and flooding are rare in January. Unseasonably heavy rain has hit 12 out of 67 provinces, officials said.“We have sent soldiers, police and the Ministry of the Interior to ease the situation,” Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters.The death toll from the floods stood at 21 on Monday with more than 330,000 households affected, according to the Department Disaster Prevention and Mitigation.The department said that the main airport in the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat would remain shut for the foreseeable future. A rail route from the Thai capital Bangkok to Nakhon Si Thammarat has also been suspended.Southern Thailand is a major rubber-producing area and the floods have come at a particularly bad time for farmers, said Uthai Sonlucksub, president of the Natural Rubber Council of Thailand.“This is the worst impact we have had in the area in 10 years. The floods are very heavy. The problem is this year we’ve seen both drought and flooding so it has been disastrous for rubber farmers,” Uthai told Reuters.Uthai said that rubber prices would increase this year because demand is set to exceed supply.“I’ve had orders from China but we aren’t even sure if we can meet these orders because of the havoc the floods have caused,” he said.“If they buy, it’ll be at higher-than-expected prices.”Widespread floods in 2011 killed more than 900 people and caused major disruption to industry, cutting economic growth that year to just 0.1 percent.",1
"""The incumbent President shall continue to exercise legislative powers until the first Congress is convened."" EO 163 s. 1987, which was issued way before the First post-EDSA Congress convened. That is, despite being just an EO, EO 163 has the force and effect of a Republic Act because Cory had ersatz dictatorial powers right after EDSA and right before Congress convened. The First post-EDSA congressIn short, EO 163 sufficiently provides legal existence for CHR so no, CHR's legal existence is not in question. Specifically, Art. XVII Sec. 6 of the 1987 Constitution states:EO 163 s. 1987, which was issued way before the First post-EDSA Congress convened.The First post-EDSA congress convened in July 1987 , about two months after Cory Aquino issued EO 163.In short, EO 163 sufficiently provides legal existence for CHR so no, CHR's legal existence is not in question.But wait, there's more.Why bother asking? Truth be told, a lot of Filipinos aren’t very happy with the CHR of late, and many are calling for its abolition mainly due to its disturbing politicization.For example, former Liberal Party Director-General and current CHR Chair Chito Gascon has been travelling all over world denouncing allegedly Duterte-sanctioned human rights violations, despite the fact that (1) there is no concrete evidence that the HR violations are indeed sanctioned by the palace and (2) it is not within the CHR’s mandate to go overseas and disparage the government.I think, however, that the Commission on Human Rights should not be abolished because the issue here is less on the legitimacy of CHR’s real purpose and more on doubts surrounding Chairman Gascon’s real motives.The House of Representatives share the same opinion, in my belief. After appropriating a measly P1,000 annual budget for CHR, House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said he may reconsider this if Gascon resigns [But of course, Gascon will NOT resign. Let me tell you why, then let me tell you what we can do about it.Why Gascon will not resign If Gascon resigns, LP will lose its best propaganda tool.The continued existence of a political party depends on its ability to project political relevance, and this is possible mainly through having party members occupy influential positions in government, positions that they can use for propaganda. That is, the continued existence of a political party is concomitant to its access to propaganda tools.Unfortunately for Gascon’s Liberal Party, its members occupy only six key avenues of power, and these are:The Vice-presidency, via LP Chairperson Leni Robredo, The Senate, via the 5 LP stalwarts senators, The Ombudsman, via Aquino-appointee Conchita Morales, and The Commission on Elections, via Aquino-appointee Andres Bautista The Supreme Court, via Aquino appointee Maria Lourdes Sereno. The CHR, via former LP director-general and Aquino-appointee Jose Luis “Chito” Gascon. Now, let’s discuss the effectiveness of each.LP’s Propaganda Tools FIRST , VP Leni Robredo tried to disparage the Duterte Administration, but she has neither the widespread charisma nor the intellectual aptitude so she’s largely ignored. Case in point, her popularity ratings continue to dip, with her net approval rating rivalling that of former VP Binay at his lowest point.SECOND , LP is also losing steam in the Senate. It’s primary attack dogThus, we are left with Senators Aquino, Pangilinan, and Drilon. Note that the other two LP senators Villanueva and Recto are already members of the Senate majority bloc so I wouldn’t consider them part of LP’s propaganda arsenal.LP Senators from left: De Lima, Aquino, Pangilinan, Drilon, and Hontiveros. Trillanes is from the Nacionalista Party but he has no party loyalty, and serves as LP's attack dog in the Senate. Now, Drilon and Pangilinan are LP stalwarts, but they’re political chameleons. While they would defend LP, they simply are not the kind of people who would stick their neck out for their party. This bears repeating: THE CHR IS NOT LEGAL FICTION.But wait, there's more.Truth be told, a lot of Filipinos aren’t very happy with the CHR of late, and many are calling for its abolition mainly due to its disturbing politicization.For example, former Liberal Party Director-General and current CHR Chair Chito Gascon has been travelling all over world denouncing allegedly Duterte-sanctioned human rights violations, despite the fact that (1) there is no concrete evidence that the HR violations are indeed sanctioned by the palace and (2) it is not within the CHR’s mandate to go overseas and disparage the government.I think, however, that the Commission on Human Rights should not be abolished because the issue here is less on the legitimacy of CHR’s real purpose and more on doubts surrounding Chairman Gascon’s real motives.The House of Representatives share the same opinion, in my belief. After appropriating a measly P1,000 annual budget for CHR, House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said he may reconsider this if Gascon resigns [ GT ].But of course, Gascon will NOT resign. Let me tell you why, then let me tell you what we can do about it.If Gascon resigns, LP will lose its best propaganda tool.The continued existence of a political party depends on its ability to project political relevance, and this is possible mainly through having party members occupy influential positions in government, positions that they can use for propaganda.

It’s primary attack dog Trillanes is toast . Its next attack dog, Senator Leila de Lima, is in detention for letting her primordial itch pave the way for the drug menace. It’s third attack dog, Kidnapper-Senator Risa Hontiveros , has become the nation’s laughing stock after gloriously bungling several times, and is at immediate risk of being perpetually disqualified from public office for wiretapping Justice Secretary Aguirre Thus, we are left with Senators Aquino, Pangilinan, and Drilon. Note that the other two LP senators Villanueva and Recto are already members of the Senate majority bloc so I wouldn’t consider them part of LP’s propaganda arsenal.Now, Drilon and Pangilinan are LP stalwarts, but they’re political chameleons. While they would defend LP, they simply are not the kind of people who would stick their neck out for their party.THIRD , the Ombudsman in itself is not a very powerful propaganda tool because it needs to work alongside other officials to pin someone down. And even if it were, Ombudsman Morales will step down in July 2018, so her days in power will be over 10 months from now.FOURTH , Comelec isn’t a very powerful propaganda tool either. It’s relevant only during the election season. Moreover, the embattled Bautista’s hold on power is already questionable, as fellowFIFTH , the Chief Justice isn’t a very powerful propaganda tool, as CJ’s typically inhibit from speaking publicly and let’s be honest: only a handful of Filipinos actually spend time reading her court decisions.Thus, we have only one avenue left: The Commission on Human Rights .Thus, If Gascon resigns, LP will lose the single most effective propaganda tool in its arsenal. So yes, Gason will not resign. But then, is resignation the only way to kick Gascon out?Removing Chito Gascon Some camps argue that Chito Gascon can only be removed through impeachment. But it seems that very question whether Gascon is an impeachable official or not, so let’s ask:Is the CHR chairman an impeachable official? The 1987 Constitution clearly lists down the types of impeachable officials. Specifically, Art. XI Sec. 2 lists impeachable officials as:The President The Vice-president The members of the Supreme Court The members of the Constitutional Commissions, and The Ombudsman. Thus, Gascon is an impeachable official if he’s a member of a constitutional commission. Thus, let’s ask:Is the CHR is a constitutional commission? At first glance, it appears that the CHR indeed is a constitutional commission, as an entire article in the Constitution is dedicated to its creation. However, Article IX, explicitly entitled “Constitutional Commission”, does NOT include the CHR in its list of constitutional commissions.Specifically, Art. IX (A) Sec. 1 states:The Constitutional Commissions, which shall be independent, are the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Elections, and the Commission on Audit. Yes, there’s no CHR in the list.Some camps may argue that the CHR, while not explicitly listed in Art. IX as a constitutional commission, can still be considered a constitutional commission because the Constitution itself created it.I found a very interesting sentence in EO 163 s. 1987, Sec. 2(d), which states:The Chairman and the Members of the Commission on Human Rights shall receive the same salary as the Chairman and Members, respectively, of the Constitutional Commissions, which shall not be decreased during their term of office. Take a harder look at the phrase “the same as… the... members… of the Constitutional Commissions...”. Cory used the phrase “of the Constitutional Commissions” instead of “of other Constitutional Commissions”, implying that Cory herself may not have considered the CHR a constitutional commission to begin with.But that’s not enough to definitive answer the question so…Fiscal Autonomy of Constitutional Commissions Article IX (A) Sec. 5 of the 1987 Constitution states:The [Constitutional Commissions] shall enjoy fiscal autonomy. Their approved annual appropriations shall be automatically and regularly released. In short, if the CHR is a constitutional commission, then the CHR should enjoy fiscal autonomy.However, in CHR Employees vs CHR [“This Court is convinced that the [Constitutional Committee] had intended to grant to the respondent the privilege of having its approved annual appropriations automatically and regularly released, but nothing more.” The High Court ruled that the CHR enjoys limited fiscal autonomy, as opposed to absolute fiscal autonomy accorded to the Constitutional Commissions. That is, if the CHR is a constitutional commission, then the Supreme Court would have categorically stated that CHR has fiscal autonomy in accordance with Art. IX (A) Sec. 5... but the Supreme Court did not. Aquino, on the other hand, appears to have presidential ambitions, and if he has been intently watching Leni Robredo, he must have realized that attacking the massively popular administration will obliterate his political future., the Ombudsman in itself is not a very powerful propaganda tool because it needs to work alongside other officials to pin someone down. And even if it were, Ombudsman Morales will step down in July 2018, so her days in power will be over 10 months from now., Comelec isn’t a very powerful propaganda tool either. It’s relevant only during the election season. Moreover, the embattled Bautista’s hold on power is already questionable, as fellow Comelec commissioners called for his resignation amidst the Andy-Tisha scandal , the Chief Justice isn’t a very powerful propaganda tool, as CJ’s typically inhibit from speaking publicly and let’s be honest: only a handful of Filipinos actually spend time reading her court decisions.Thus, we have only one avenue left:Thus, If Gascon resigns, LP will lose the single most effective propaganda tool in its arsenal. So yes, Gason will not resign. But then, is resignation the only way to kick Gascon out?Some camps argue that Chito Gascon can only be removed through impeachment. But it seems that very question whether Gascon is an impeachable official or not, so let’s ask:The 1987 Constitution clearly lists down the types of impeachable officials. Specifically, Art.

That is, if the CHR is a constitutional commission, then the Supreme Court would have categorically stated that CHR has fiscal autonomy in accordance with Art. IX (A) Sec. 5... but the Supreme Court did not.CHR cannot be a constitutional commission.Let’s me restate:The Supreme Court said the CHR enjoys LIMITED fiscal autonomy, which means it is not a Constitutional Commission, which enjoys full fiscal autonomy. Because CHR is not a constitutional commission, its members are NOT in the list of impeachable officials. Yes, the CHR is a Constitutional Office but it is NOT a Constitutional Commission.Let’s me restate:Particularly, CHR chair Chito Gascon is not an impeachable official.Not impeachable means no ImmunityFor example, Greco Belgica’s disbarment case versus Ombudsman Morales was dismissed on the grounds that impeachable officials are immune to lawsuits that would in effect impeach them, as evidenced by Ombudsman vs CA and Mojica [“The Ombudsman or his deputies must first be removed from office via… impeachment… Should the tenure of the Ombudsman be thus terminated by impeachment, he may then be held to answer either criminally or administratively e.g., in disbarment proceedings…” With Gascon not enjoying immunity, we can actually file administrative or criminal charges against him, charges that will not be dismissed on the ground of immunity, charges that, if proven, will merit his removal from the CHR.Again, impeachment for Gascon won’t be necessary: it’s just a matter of filing (and winning) administrative or criminal cases for Gascon to be removed from CHR… and my sources tell me that a case is already in the works.

This date of issuance is important in light of the 1987 Constitution’s Transitory Provisions.",0

Robert Reyes.De Lima has been detained for the past two weeks on three charges of drug trafficking at the national penitentiary when she was justice secretary under then President Benigno Aquino III.President Rodrigo Duterte, who did not hide his contempt for De Lima, made the allegations himself at the start of his presidency.De Lima has said that this was the President’s way of getting back at her for linking him to the so-called Davao Death Squad that killed hundreds of suspected criminals when he was Davao City mayor, and to the extrajudicial killings in his administration’s campaign against illegal drugs that has so far left more than 8,000 dead.Reyes has regularly visited De Lima since she was detained on Feb. 24. He has said several Masses attended by her family and visitors.He said it was De Lima’s “courage and sense of humor” that get her through each day.Despite her detention, the senator “smiles a lot” and is genuinely happy to welcome visitors, Reyes said.“Leila now is really isolated. That is quite a challenge for a social animal like her who is very friendly,” Reyes said.When her visitors come to lift De Lima’s spirits, they leave inspired by her. Reyes said that during his Masses, the small congregation would share their thoughts with De Lima and “they were in tears.”“They know this is an innocent person suffering unjustly,” Reyes said.Reyes said a spiritual renewal often took place inside prison. He and De Lima have agreed to “frame” her detention in the context of the Lenten season in the Catholic faith.“She is prepared for the long haul, but she is also hoping for a miracle. Our time frame is 40 days of Lent, 40 days of confinement. Every day, she reads the proposed readings for the day of Lent and the reflections to enter more deeply into the spirit of Lent,” Reyes said.One time De Lima asked him to bless her detention area.It was something that struck the priest because he himself did not even think of blessing his own cell in Camp Crame where he was detained for 16 days with Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, retired Gen. Danilo Lim, and junior officers belonging to the Magdalo group in 2007 following their arrest for the Manila Peninsula siege.Reyes described De Lima, a 57-year-old mother and grandmother, as “one tough cookie.” It will take a lot to break her, he said.De Lima sees her detention as an opportunity, not a setback, in her fight to defend human rights, he said.She has also been catching up on sleep, going to bed early and rising at 5 a.m. to exercise by walking around the small courtyard outside her cell.She is actually thankful that she now has time to read, Reyes said.Her visitors have been bringing her books, aside from food. Former President Aquino brought her chocolates and a copy of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, a 1,000 plus-page book.De Lima also keeps a daily journal. “Being the reflective person that she is, I think she will have a good collection of life lessons to share with everyone else once she is out of confinement,” Reyes said.The most important thing, he said, is De Lima “connecting with her family in a very unique and personal way.”Aside from the senator’s staff, her siblings, in-laws, and relatives visit her every day. They keep her company and also help entertain her visitors.De Lima’s mother who is 84, however, does not know her daughter is under detention. Whenever her mother asks for her, she is told that the senator is out of the country.Reyes said he had told the senator to focus on herself throughout her detention, to deepen her life in prayer and strengthen her body and mind because she would continue to play an important role in the lives of the Filipino people.“I’ve told her that whatever battles she faces in the future would require not only the usual feisty and courageous De Lima, but also a physically strong, mentally and psychologically focused Leila,” Reyes said.",1
"Yahoo has been ordered by a federal judge to face much of a lawsuit in the United States claiming that the personal information of all 3 billion users was compromised in a series of data breaches.In a decision on Friday night, US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California rejected a bid by Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), which bought Yahoo’s Internet business last June, to dismiss many claims, including for negligence and breach of contract.Koh dismissed some other claims. She had previously denied Yahoo’s bid to dismiss some unfair competition claims.Yahoo was accused of being too slow to disclose three data breaches that occurred from 2013 and 2016, increasing users’ risk of identity theft and requiring them to spend money on credit freeze, monitoring and other protection services.The breaches were revealed after New York-based Verizon agreed to buy Yahoo’s Internet business, and prompted a cut in the purchase price to about $4.5 billion.A Verizon spokesman had no immediate comment on Monday. A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The plaintiffs amended their complaint after Yahoo last October revealed that the 2013 breach affected all 3 billion users, tripling its earlier estimate.Koh said the amended complaint highlighted the importance of security in the plaintiffs’ decision to use Yahoo.“Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to show that they would have behaved differently had defendants disclosed the security weaknesses of the Yahoo Mail System,” Koh wrote.She also said the plaintiffs could try to show that liability limits in Yahoo’s terms of service were “unconscionable,” given the allegations that Yahoo knew its security was deficient but did little.In seeking a dismissal, Yahoo said it has long been the target of “relentless criminal attacks,” and the plaintiffs’ “20/20 hindsight” did not cast doubt on its “unending” efforts to thwart “constantly evolving security threats.”Last March, U.S. prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers in connection with one of the Yahoo breaches.One accused hacker, Karim Baratov, a Canadian born in Kazakhstan, pleaded guilty in November to aggravated identity theft and conspiracy charges. The other defendants remained at large in Russia.The case is In re: Yahoo Inc Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, US District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-md-02752.",1
"Ash fell like snow and heavy smoke had residents gasping for air Monday as a huge Southern California wildfire exploded in size again, becoming the fifth largest in state history and driving celebrities from a wealthy hillside enclave.Tens of thousands have fled their homes as flames churn through foothill towns near Santa Barbara, the latest flare-up after a week of wind-fanned wildfires throughout the region.With acrid smoke thick in the air, even residents not under evacuation orders were leaving, fearing another shutdown of a key coastal highway that was closed intermittently last week.Officials handed out masks to those who stayed behind in Montecito, an exclusive community about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles that’s home to stars such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Drew Barrymore.Actor Rob Lowe wore a mask as he live-streamed his family evacuating Sunday from their smoke-shrouded home.“Praying for the people in my area,” he said to his Instagram followers. “Hope everybody’s getting out safe like we are, and thanks for the prayers and thoughts. And good luck to the firefighters, we need you!”Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted that neighbors were helping each other and their animals get to safety.",1
"The AASENSO Partylist has alloted P8 million for the technical and vocational scholarship of some 400 poor but willing to learn Cordillerans, its national chairman said on Friday.Lawyer Isagani Nerez of AASENSO said the scholarship is in support to President Duterte’s campaign urging young Filipinos who want to acquire skills to take up technical and vocational courses offered by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA).Nerez said AASENSO Partylist has set aside the amount to finance 400 qualified high school graduates in this city and the other provinces in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) who want to study courses in TESDA or in schools accredited by the agency.He said they will be issuing vouchers to the qualified students, which they can use to take up their desired tech-vocational courses in school which are accredited by TESDA.Nationwide, AASENSO has 5,000 TESDA vouchers assigned to different parts of the country.",1
"Tens of thousands of families were driven from their homes by floods and landslides in 322 barangays in the Eastern Visayas and Caraga regions as Tropical Storm “Urduja” (international name: Kai-tak) barreled westward across Samar Island on Saturday.Five hours after making landfall at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday in the vicinity of San Policarpo, Eastern Samar, Urduja increased speed to 15 kilometers per hour and packed maximum sustained winds of 80 kph while slicing through the town of San Jose de Buan.At least four people were killed in landslides in Biliran and Ormoc City and four others, including three fishermen in Samar, remained missing, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).Ferry and air transport services remained suspended in Eastern and Central Visayas, and disaster relief officials issued warnings of more flooding and storm surges as Urduja headed for Central Visayas.Some 1,000 families from 15 coastal villages in Daanbantayan, Cebu, were asked to vacate their homes under threat from huge waves.According to the NDRRMC operations center in Camp Aguinaldo, a total of 8,832 families, made up of 38,850 people, were moved to evacuation centers on Friday in Eastern Samar, Northern Samar, Western Samar, Leyte, Southern Leyte, Dinagat Islands and Surigao del Norte.The evacuees were part of the 158,166 people from 35,021 families displaced by floods in the Eastern Visayas and Caraga regions.A total of 11,101 passengers, as well as 1,322 rolling cargoes, 52 vessels and 33 motorized boats, were stranded in the seaports of Calabarzon, Mimaropa, the Bicol region, Western and Eastern Visayas, and Metro Manila, officials said.Nearly 30 areas in the country were placed under storm signals by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) which expected Urduja to bring more rains and pack stronger winds in the next three days.Pagasa weather specialists said Urduja would leave the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) as early as Tuesday evening. Unfortunately, Urduja may not be the last tropical cyclone for the month or the year.At 5 p.m. on Saturday, a low pressure area (LPA) was located 2,180 km east of South Cotabato and could enter the PAR on Wednesday, according to weather specialist Samuel Duran.In a later briefing, the Pagasa’s Aldczar Aurelio said that the LPA would be named “Vinta” should it intensify into a tropical cyclone.The Pagasa warned of continued scattered to widespread moderate to heavy rains, which may cause floodings and landslides, over the Bicol region, the Visayas, southern Quezon, Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Mindoro provinces, Marinduque and Romblon.Sea travel was still discouraged over the country’s eastern seaboards from Bicol to the tip of Mindanao and in both seaboards in Central Visayas.By 5 p.m. on Saturday, only areas in southern Luzon and the Visayas remained under storm signal.Under signal No. 2 were Sorsogon and Masbate, including Ticao Islands, and Romblon, northern Samar, the northern part of Eastern Samar, the northern part of Samar, Biliran, Antique, Aklan, Capiz and northern Iloilo.Signal No. 1 was hoisted over southern Quezon, Marinduque, the southern parts of Occidental and Oriental Mindoro, Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, Albay, Burias Island, northern Palawan, Cuyo Island, Calamian Group of Islands, Iloilo, the rest of Samar, the rest of Eastern Samar, Guimaras, Negros Occidental, the northern part of Negros Oriental, northern Cebu and Leyte.The NDRRMC identified the four fatalities as Winnie Garbo, 55, Maribeth Garbo, 52, Wilma Garbo, 12, and Jimmy Jorge, 2. They were killed in a landslide in Sitio Barobohan, Barangay Iyusan, Almeria town in Biliran.Rescuers were still searching for Juanita Montellana Cabillo, who was believed to have been buried alive when a landslide destroyed her house in Barangay Tongonan, Ormoc City.Cabillo’s husband, Nelson, survived after his brother-in-law and his two sons pulled him out of a huge mound of earth that had covered him from the neck down.Leyte Gov. Dominico Petilla placed the province under a state of calamity as floods inundated 60 percent of the 138 villages in Tacloban City alone.More than 2,000 families in Tacloban and another 300 in Ormoc City were moved to evacuation centers as floodwaters rose to at least waist-deep, said Lutgarda Barredo, chief of the Tacloban Rescue Team Unit.A baby girl and a woman, both unidentified, were also injured in the city, the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) reported.In Samar, some 5,000 families from 18 towns were evacuated to safer ground while massive landslides blocked the national highway at Barangay Laygayon in Pinabacdao town and at Barangay Tarabucan in Calbayog City, said Van Torrevillas of the the province’s PDRRMO.Another 2,024 families living in coastal villages were evacuated because of the threat of storm surges and flooding, said Brig. Gen. Mario Lacurom, commanding officer of the Army’s 803rd Infantry Brigade based in Catarman town.Samar and Leyte, with a combined population of about 4.5 million, had borne the brunt of Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) four years ago that left more than 7,350 people dead or missing.But the heavy rains unleashed by Urduja did not prevent Catholics in Southern Luzon and the Visayas from attending the first Mass of the nine-day “Simbang Gabi” on Saturday.“The rains were nonstop but this did not stop people from hearing Mass,” Fr. Jenious Mansalay, social action director of the Diocese of Mabate, said over Church-run Radio Veritas.Fr. Alcris Badana, of the Diocese of Palo, noted that the turnout for the Mass was smaller than last year’s.“There were many churchgoers who attended the Simbang Gabi but their number was smaller because of the rains and floods,” Badana said.",1

"President Rodrigo Duterte on Saturday vowed to give equal share of the national wealth to Mindanao as he promised equal treatment for all Filipinos.“We will treat you equally. I will see to it that the Moros, Christians or the Igorots will be treated alike,” he said in a speech at the launching of the Comprehensive Reform and Development Agenda in Cotabato.“You will have your equal share of the national wealth,” he added.Duterte said Mindanao was rich in natural resources and could “develop to its fullest extent.”“Mindanao holds a promise in agriculture. You will be the richest,” he said.The President said he would provide agricultural equipment to the farmers in Mindanao to help them in their livelihood.“Bigyan ninyo ako ng konting panahon. I will improve the Moro land Mindanao,” he said.The Chief Executive also mentioned that a businessman had pledged to donate P1 billion, which would be used to construct a hospital in Basilan. Duterte said the hospital would be completed in 2017.But despite his dreams for the region, the President noted that insurgency had hindered its development.He reiterated his appeal to the Moros and the communist rebels to stop waging war against fellow Filipinos. He also made the same call to the bandit group Abu Sayyaf.“Hintuan niyo na yan. So much hatred. Stop it,” he said.During his speech, Duterte pushed anew his plan for federalism, which he believed would be the best form of government for the country.RELATED STORIES",1
"Three innocent civilians, aged 9, 11, and 70, were killed in the crossfire when army troopers and New People’s Army (NPA) rebels battled it out in Cawayan municipality, Masbate last Thursday.Senior Inspector Malu Calubaquib, Police Regional Office 5 (PRO5) spokesperson, identified the fatalities as Lolita Pepito, 70; Crislyn, 11, a Grade 4 pupil; and Reden, 9, all residents of Sitio Lubigan, Barangay Panan Awan in Cawayan.Calubaquib said the Philippine Army’s 3rd Scout Ranger Company led by Lieutenant Karl John Cabillo had engaged seven NPA guerrillas in a gun battle when the rebels positioned themselves outside the house of Paulino C. Pepito, a 70-year-old widower, who was also wounded in the crossfire.The report reaching the PRO5 did not mention whether the bullets that killed the three civilians and wounded Pepito in the left arm were fired by the rebels or the soldiers.No one was killed or wounded on the side of government forces, said Calubaquib.Rebel activity has been high in Masbate in recent weeks with armed encounter between the military and the NPA last Saturday resulting in the deaths of three guerrilla fighters in Barangay San Antonio, Milagros town.Army Colonel Greg Almerol, commander of the 2nd Infantry Battalion (2IB), said the rebels, led by Ruel Ibañez, alias “Ka Gemo,” were in Barangay San Antonio to conduct extortion activities.",1
"Duck raisers here expressed their profound gratitude to the government for lifting the ban on the trade and transport of live poultry and its by-products, which help them recover from financial loses.The Candaba Duck Raisers and Farmers Multi-Purpose Cooperative specifically lauded the efforts of the Department of Agriculture (DA), the provincial government of Pampanga and concerned local government units, saying all the stakeholders were concerned with their predicament as they faced millions of peso losses in the duck industry following the bird flu outbreak in San Luis town.“Maraming salamat sa tulong ninyo at hindi ninyo kami pinabayaan sa gitna ng krisis,’’ said Benedicta Baylon, president of the cooperative.She particularly cited Pampanga Gov. Lilia Pineda for her efforts in ensuring that the duck industry bounces back and recovers.Candaba Mayor Danilo Baylon also lauded the DA’s lifting of the ban as he expressed hope that this will encourage poultry farm owners to continue or restart their business.He said the bird flu outbreak in San Luis town resulted in massive losses at least P5-million a day to duck egg raisers as 80 percent of their egg production is shipped to Visayas and Mindanao, and only 20 percent are distributed in the island of Luzon.He also stressed that the avian outbreak also significantly affected poultry feed sales.“Sa totoo nyan 30 pesos nalang ang farm gate price ng mga manok sa buong Central Luzon,” the mayor said.The mayor further appealed to the national government for the financial assistance to be provided to the poultry farmers and displaced farm workers in the province.The Department of Agriculture (DA) lifted the poultry ban from Luzon to other parts of the country based on the recommendations of biosecurity experts that it is now safe to move the poultry products.Also, DA said the avian flu outbreak had been contained in San Luis town.The DA, however, clarified that restriction remains on poultry products from within the 7-kilometer control area in Barangay San Carlos in San Luis town.",1

"Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said he was set to conduct surprise inspections in schools where the controversial dengue vaccine program was rolled out as part of the Department of Health’s (DOH) monitoring of more than 830,000 children who had been given Dengvaxia.Duque said the school visits in Marikina, Pampanga, Cavite and Cebu would begin next week to check if DOH regional offices had implemented the department’s awareness campaigns, like a plan to put up posters with crucial pieces of information on dengue immunization.“We will do a program visitation, we will begin unannounced visit to schools so that the DOH people on the ground will know what DOH central office has put them to task,” said the health chief in a forum on Friday.Right size, spacingDuque added that he would check whether the posters placed in classrooms complied with the required size and distance from each other.He also said it was important not only to propagate information but also ensure the message was understood on posters that carried the department’s “4S” dengue prevention campaign—search and destroy, self-protection, seek early consultation and say “No” to indiscriminate fogging.In coordination with the Department of Education, all students vaccinated with Dengvaxia will be given letters containing updates on the vaccine and reminders about what dengue symptoms to watch out for, according to Health Undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo.Domingo also said the DOH had already urged Sanofi Pasteur, manufacturer of the dengue vaccine, to come up with a test kit that would determine if a child’s blood has dengue virus “so we can know which kids are at risk.”DangerousThe health agency halted its massive dengue vaccine program, launched in April 2016, after the French pharmaceutical firm released an advisory saying its vaccine could cause severe dengue symptoms among those who had no previous exposure to the virus.It has also formed a panel of experts from Philippine General Hospital that would study the circumstances behind the deaths of 14 children who were given the anti-dengue vaccine under the government’s immunization program.",1

"WARNING GRAPHIC:Six police officers were killed, including the police chief of Guihulngan, Negros Oriental, while two others were wounded when the members of terrorist group New People’s Army surprisingly attacked their patrol vehicle Friday morning.According to Region 18 police, the encounter took place around 10 a.m in Guihulngan.The police officers killed were identified as Superintendent Arnel Arpon, Guihulngan police chief; Senior Police Officer 2 Necasio Tabilon; Police Officer 3 Jordan Balderas; Police Officer 2 Alvin Paul Bulandres; Police Officer 2 Alfred Dunque; and Police Officer 1 Abines Silvano.Wounded police who were quickly rushed to the hospital were SPO4 Jerome Delara and PO2 Jorie Maribao.The police personnel responded to a call that Sangguniang Bayan member Edison dela Risa was ambushed by suspected NPA members in Barangay Magsaysay.Arpon, who led a 15-man team on board a police patrol car and three motorcycles went to the site.But on their way to the area, suspected members of NPA fired their guns towards the police officers.The police officers tried to exchange gunshots to the NPA members, but they were outnumbered by the terror group who were heavily armed.Netizen Tely Regala Aba posted some of the photos of the dead police officers.The 79th Infranty Battalion is now conducting pursuit operation against the terror group.The ambush happened in the same day when, President Rodrigo Duterte said that he would not ‘waste his time’ to talk with the CPP-NPA-NDF and he announced that the peace negotiations between the government and the reds was over.“I don’t want to talk to them.

"RETIRED chief justice Reynato Puno, chairman of the Consultative Committee (ConCom) tasked to draft a new charter, said the allocation of pork barrel funds would no longer be allowed under the federal form of government.The 22-man ConCom approved on Tuesday the 78-page draft constitution for the proposed Federal Republic of the Philippines.Puno on Wednesday said under federalism, local governments would no longer receive pork barrel funds from the national government.“If our proposal will be approved, there will be no more pork barrel from the national government because they will be given the power to generate their own funds,” he said in a radio interview.“Meron na silang sariling (They have their own) power to tax at di sila aasa dun sa binibigay na salapi ng (and they will no longer be dependent on) national government including ‘yung mga pork barrel na ‘yan,” he added.Puno revealed that one of the highly debated provisions in the proposed charter was the structure of the federal government.“One of the biggest debates is whether we must have federal presidential form of government or federal parliamentary form or semi-parliamentary form. Hating-hati ‘yung mga miyembro dun. At sa bandang huli ang nanalo ay ‘yung federal presidential form of government (The members were divided on that issue. In the end, those in favor of federal presidential form of government won),” Puno said.The draft charter states that the federal government has the power to levy and collect all taxes, duties, fees, charges and other impositions except those granted to the federated regions.The federated regions would have the power to levy and collect real property tax; estate tax; donor’s tax; documentary stamp tax; professional tax; franchise tax; environmental tax, pollution tax, and similar taxes; road user’s tax; vehicle registration fees; transport franchise fees; and local taxes and other taxes which may be granted by federal law.The federal government and the federated regions must ensure that taxation shall be uniform, equitable and progressive. No double taxation shall be allowed.The federated regions would be given a share of not less than 50 percent of all collected taxes on income, excise, VAT (value added tax), and customs duties, which shall be equally divided among them and automatically released.The Supreme Court in November 2013 declared the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) or pork barrel “unconstitutional.”",1
"The Supreme Court (SC) has dismissed a petition to cite for indirect contempt filed by lawyer Herminio Harry Roque Jr. against former Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang (retired), former Camp Aguinaldo Camp Commander Brig. Gen. Arthur Ang (retired) and former AFP Public Affairs Office chief Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc.Roque lodged the case against the three military officials, who stopped the family of transgender Jennifer Laude, who was killed by a US Marine–Private Joseph Scott Pemberton–from barging into Camp Aguinaldo, the AFP’s general headquarters in Quezon City.In a 26-page decision penned by Justice Marvic Leonen, promulgated on February 15, 2017, the High Court’s 2nd Division ruled that citing the respondent AFP officials in contempt, as prayed for by Roque, “would be an unreasonable exercise of this court’s contempt power.”“When a lawyer chooses to conduct his cases in as public a manner as in this case, it would be an abuse of our contempt power to stifle the subject of his attention. A lawyer who uses the public fora as his battleground cannot expect to be protected from public scrutiny.”On October 29, 2014, the respondent AFP officials released a press statement that they were considering filing disbarment proceedings against Roque after the latter and his clients, the family of the slain Laude, together with German citizen Marc Sueselbeck forced their way inside the premises of Camp Aguinaldo to demand to see the suspect Pemberton.The AFP said Roque fomented disorder by inciting his clients to scale the perimeter fence to see the US Marine.After a disbarment complaint against him was filed on November 4, 2014, Roque filed a petition to cite the respondents for indirect contempt, arguing that their acts put to question his professional and personal reputation and violated Section 18, Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court, which provides that “proceedings against attorneys shall be private and confidential.”The SC said while the general rule on confidentiality is that publicly disclosing disbarment proceedings may be punished with contempt so as to prevent the use of disbarment proceedings as a tool to damage a lawyer’s reputation in the public sphere, such confidentiality rule is not absolute.“The confidentiality rule requires only that ‘proceedings against attorneys’ be kept private and confidential… However, the rule does not extend so far that it covers the mere existence or pendency of disciplinary actions,” it added.According to the High Court, “[A] lawyer who regularly seeks attention and readily welcomes, if not invites, media coverage, cannot expect to be totally sheltered from public interest himself.”Also, the SC ruled that the press statement of the respondents regarding the disbarment complaint against Roque did not, in itself, violate the confidentiality rule given that it did not discuss the disbarment complaint itself nor did it divulge acts or character traits on the part of Roque that would have damaged his personal and professional reputation.It said it was unlikely that Roque’s reputation could be further damaged by a factual report that a complaint had been actually filed, adding that Roque himself made it even more public by filing the instant case against the entire AFP instead of targeting only the individuals who participated in the disclosure.JOMAR CANLAS",1
"THE HOUSE Committee on Appropriations has swiftly passed the proposed budgets of the Office of the President (OP) and Office of the Vice President (OVP) for 2017, following tradition that lawmakers reserve scrutiny of the budgets at the plenary.The OP budget passed the committee level in nine minutes and the OVP in three minutes.The lone question about the OP budget came from House Minority Floor Leader Quezon Rep. Danilo Suarez, when he asked Ambassador Marciano Paynor if the P15.4-billion budget earmarked for the Philippines’ hosting of the 50th anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) next year was sufficient.Paynor answered in the affirmative.The “grilling” during the hearing for the OVP budget came from Committee on Appropriations chair, Davao Rep. Karlo Nograles, who asked Mara Carmela Duterte, OVP chief of the local affairs and special projects division, if she was related to President Duterte.When she said she was not related to the President, Nograles jokingly insisted that she was.Unlike at the Senate where she defended the OVP budget for 2017, Robredo was unable to face the House of Committee on Appropriations on Tuesday.Robredo had a prior engagement in Mindanao, where she will be visiting communities for her poverty alleviation and housing programs.The OP budget increased by an astounding 607 percent, owing to the funds earmarked for the Asean anniversary and the administration’s campaign against illegal drugs.Opposition lawmaker Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said that while he would “adhere” to the House tradition of “liberating” the OP from interpellation on its proposed budget, “that tradition does not extend to the plenary debates on the budget of the Office of the President.”Meanwhile, the OVP budget was 14.28 percent lower than the 2016 budget of the OVP.Robredo’s chief of staff, Boyet Dy, told reporters that the decrease in the budget was due to the OVP’s transfer from the Coconut Palace to the Quezon City Reception House, which allowed the office to save some P200,000 in rental fees.With a smaller office, costs for utilities is also expected to be lower, Dy said.Dy added that Robredo had strict instructions to practice austerity not only at the office, but also when she goes to provinces as part of her poverty alleviation and housing and development programs.",1
"A Latin phrase meaning “first among equals,” Wikipedia.org cites “primus inter pares” as “typically used as an honorary title for those who are formally equal to other members of their group but are accorded unofficial respect.” It is noted that the “princeps senatus” of the Roman Senate was such a figure and initially only bore the distinction that he was allowed to speak first during the debate. “Among modern figures such as the chair of the Federal Reserve, the prime minister of parliamentary regimes, the chief justice of the United States and the ecumenical patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church bear higher status and various additional powers while remaining still merely equal to their peers in important senses.”I had the good fortune of serving in two government boards where the concept of “primus inter pares” was acknowledged and observed with excellent results for the smooth functioning of the organization. In the Board of Investments, with then DTI Secretary Jose Concepcion as chairman and Tomas Alcantara as vice-chairman and managing head, the board could always rely on both to be strong in their opinions and views but accommodating as well to the differing positions of other governors. There were instances where I deferred to them, given Joe’s long experience in business and industry but he in turn would always go my way when it came to small and medium enterprises. Both Joe and Tommy also recognized the importance of ground experience that after I related my travails riding a bus from Cauayan, Isabela, they supported my recommendation to launch the Bus Modernization Program. Joe initially was against “portalets” but when I argued that it was part of a modern waste management system he went along which allowed the pilot units to come in and help alleviate the sanitary conditions in the wake of the earthquake in Baguio. Board discussions could be lively but always in an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect.With BSP Governor Rafael Buenaventura as chairman of the Monetary Board, we worked as a team. Each Monetary Board Member was assigned a sphere of influence and we had Monday sessions where we would discuss controversial issues so that the regular Thursday board meetings would have had all kinks ironed out. I once complained to Paeng that the recorded minutes would not reflect the full breadth and scale of our deliberations. He advised me to just repeat my arguments for the record. Paeng despite his extensive experience in international and local banking was always open to the views of Nonoy Alindogan, former treasurer of Ayala Corporation, Johnny Quintos, a retired BSP deputy governor with years as a central banker, Vince Valdepenas, former economic secretary and economics professor, Teddy Valdepenas, a Citibanker and later Fe Barin, the institutional memory of BSP. All of our decisions were collegial and even if we had initial contrary opinions, once an MB decision was made we supported it. Even if at times there could be personal differences, we resolved it among ourselves as mature persons and never brought our differences to the public arena.It is with deep regret that I have been following the proceedings in Congress on the impeachment hearings of Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno and reading tidbits of “infighting” in the chambers of the Supreme Court. I wonder why the disagreements mostly on leadership and management were not settled among the justices themselves. If the rift had reached intolerable levels, could not the justices in banc have confronted the chief justice?Why did some justices have to wait for an impeachment hearing to “spill the beans” raising suspicions that they had become part of the administration allies’ move to punish the Chief Justice for her “original sin” which was defying President Rodrigo’s order for judges allegedly linked to the drug trade to step down? Did they not realize that their testimonies and actuations inthe hearings erode public respect in and credibility of the Supreme Court just as they believe the chief justice’s arbitrary actions made her lose their regard for if not respect for her? I admire Senior Justice Antonio Carpio who declined an invitation to appear in Congress and who, I believe, is in the best position to unite the Supreme Court.It is time for the Congress to dismiss the complaints. The acts being attributed to the chief justice may be lapses in management and deal more with relationships among justices; certainly not impeachable offences. Then the Supreme Court and the chief justice in their wisdom and desire to protect the institution they and we love will arrive at the right decision.",1
"It was an audacious plot sketched out in chilling detail with blue pens on the back of a paper calendar: Islamic militants in the Philippines, including one of the world’s most-wanted militant leaders, would take over a key central Mindanao city in their boldest attack to date.With unsettling calm, the terrorist leaders spoke of taking hostages from a school, sealing off roads and capturing a highway “so the people will get scared.”Video footage and a separate screen-grab image of that secret meeting, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press (AP), offer a rare glimpse into the clandestine operations of the terrorists who followed through two weeks ago with an unprecedented assault on the lakeside city of Marawi, parts of which they still occupy today.The images also provide the first visual proof that a nascent alliance of local Islamist fighters are not only aligned with the Islamic State (IS) group, but coordinating and executing complex attacks together.Among those at the table is the purported leader of the IS branch in Southeast Asia, Isnilon Hapilon, who is on Washington’s list of most-wanted terrorists and has a $5-million bounty on his head.The footage is believed to be the first of Hapilon since he and several other Filipino militants pledged allegiance to IS in 2014. The military had said Hapilon was wounded in a January airstrike.In the video, however, there are no indications that Hapilon is injured. He appears sitting with other militants at a table, wearing a yellow and black headscarf with a pistol beside his folded arms.The Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff, Gen. Eduardo Año, confirmed the identities of those present, including Hapilon, who resembled other images said to be of him, such as those on FBI wanted posters.The images show that the insurgent alliance “has this intention of not only rebellion, but actually dismembering a portion of Philippine territory by occupying the whole of Marawi City and establishing their own Islamic state or government,” Año said.Interest of militaryThe military has an interest in allowing AP to make the footage public. On Monday, seven lawmakers petitioned the Supreme Court to nullify President Duterte’s imposition of martial law in Mindanao—homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic country—casting doubt on the gravity of the crisis there.Año said the reality that “a full-blown rebellion” was underway should convince skeptics that this was not just “a small problem.”Government troops discovered the video on a cell phone they seized during a May 23 raid on a Marawi safe house where Hapilon and other militants were believed to be hiding.The military said the video had been filmed a day or two earlier. It was not possible to independently verify that claim.But a separate screen grab of the same meeting, obtained by AP from an antiterrorism agent, showed a calendar the militants were writing on that was dated 2017.An Army official allowed AP to record the video as it played on a laptop computer.Año said the insurgents had been planning to attack Marawi on May 26, the start of Ramadan in Mindanao. But the raid cut their preparations short and triggered instant clashes.Had the assault not been preempted, the militants likely would have seized more territory and inflicted far more damage.Heartland of Islamic faithAs it stands, the fighting has been unprecedented. While militants have launched major attacks before, never before has any Islamist group occupied territory in the heartland of the Philippines’ Islamic faith for this long.Two weeks after the conflict began, at least 180 people have been killed, and the Army is still battling to regain control of Marawi with airstrikes and artillery.The militants, who are believed to be holding a Catholic priest and many other hostages, have torched buildings and destroyed at least one church.Año said the terrorists had occupied 10 percent of the city and had positioned snipers in tall buildings. Much of the city center has been devastated.The crisis in Marawi, combined with fears that IS is breathing new life into Muslim insurgencies in Southeast Asia, has put the Philippines and the region on edge.On Friday, when a masked gunman began shooting and burning gambling tables at the Resorts World Manila casino in Pasay City, terrified patrons immediately assumed an IS siege was underway.The radical group claimed responsibility for the attack, in which dozens of people died of smoke inhalation, but there had been no evidence to back that claim.Police insist the motive was robbery, and the gunman’s family says he was a disgruntled gambling addict.Still, the episode highlighted what Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez described as the “unsettling inadequacy” of public security in Metro Manila. The attack, he said, should “serve as a wake-up call” to do something about it.New IS baseA three-day security conference this past weekend in Singapore attended by defense ministers and experts from 39 nations produced a flurry of alarmed statements.Among the topics: a fear that places like Marawi City could become a new base for the IS group as it loses territory in the Middle East.“If the situation in Marawi in southern Philippines is allowed to escalate or entrench, it would pose decades of problems,” Singapore Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen said.“All of us recognize that if not addressed adequately, it can prove a pulling ground for would-be jihadists,” he added.The southern Philippines already is.Of the 120 militants killed in Marawi so far, at least eight are known to be foreign fighters, including a Chechen, a Yemeni and several Malaysians and Indonesians, according to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.Hapilon’s pledge of allegiance, meanwhile, may have already paid off. His faction has received a “couple of million dollars” from IS, Lorenzana said.Abdullah MauteIn the two-minute video clip obtained by AP, a long-haired man identified by the military as Abdullah Maute addresses other militant leaders gathered around a white plastic table.Pointing to a crude sketch of Marawi’s main streets and speaking in Tagalog and Marawi’s Maranao dialect, Maute declares, “We’ll take this first and then here.”“Or,” he says, “we can go here first. We seal this off so you’ll have a passageway. But we need to capture a highway so the people will get scared.” Another militant can be seen videotaping the clandestine meeting.Maute is the leader of a militant group called IS Ranao—one of about 10 small armed groups that have also pledged allegiance to IS and have forged a loose alliance that now flies IS-style black flags.Although virtually unheard of a few years ago, IS Ranao contributed over 260 of the fighters who attacked mosque-studded Marawi, according to the military.Along with Hapilon’s group, IS Ranao has been blamed for a night-market bombing in September last year that killed 15 people in Davao City, Mr. Duterte’s hometown.2 Maute brothersAlso appearing in the video clip are two of Maute’s brothers—Omarkhayam and Maddi—and another militant known as Abu Humam.Humam is a member of Khilafah Islamiyah Mindanao, a small group linked to a 2013 bombing that killed eight people at a bar in Cagayan de Oro City, not far from Marawi.The new armed groups are the latest offshoots of a decades-long Moro separatist conflict fueled by wrenching poverty, weak law enforcement and a surfeit of weapons in Mindanao.The two biggest Moro rebel groups, which have engaged in peace talks with the government, have not backed the militants who attacked Marawi and offered to help bring the siege to an end.Hapilon’s militant alliance aims to establish a “wilayat,” or a provincial territory, which will form part of a caliphate in Southeast Asia, according to experts.Mr. Duterte has said government forces will never allow them to do that or break away from the Philippines.",1
"Western media, especially Time magazine, was heavily used in the 1980s to build up the Aquino brand and to demonize Marcos. The same strategy is being applied on Duterte today.There's a recent article on Time written by a writer named Rishi Iyengar who should be sent back to journalism school. This guy wrote a report about Duterte and the war on drugs, and the main Philippine national government official he interviewed was—don't laugh—Senator Leila de Lima. Yes, believe it. He also included a token quote from PNP chief Bato de la Rosa, but only so he could depict the ""closeness"" of Bato to Duterte as some kind of blind loyalty to a mass murderer. Iyengar's main interviewee was Leila de Lima, the accused drug lord protector herself. Maybe Iyengar should also interview Lucifer about the Christian faith.Other minor interviewees of Iyengar among government officials: Mike Rama, the former mayor of Cebu who is also an accused drug coddler; and Chito Gascon, the die-hard yellow CHR head appointed by Noynoy Aquino under whose presidency the drug lords thrived. Makes you wonder how much research Iyengar actually did before he wrote his article.This is the problem with foreigners who self-righteously criticize what's going on in our country when in fact they don't have a clue. Iyengar thinks he knows better than the 16+ million Filipinos who voted for Duterte, and the 91% of Filipinos who trust Duterte. In effect, Iyengar is saying that nearly all of us Filipinos, all 91%, are idiots, and we should ignore the realities that we see with our own eyes everyday, and listen to him instead. Why? Because—shiver me timbers—he's with Time magazine! The Time logo is supposed to razzle-dazzle us indios into forgetting we have our own brains.Iyengar calls the planned investigation against De Lima, and the info about her driver-lover, a ""smear campaign"". He obviously doesn't know that the news about De Lima's driver-lover has been an open secret for years and De Lima herself has not denied it. Has Iyengar even seen the pictures of De Lima partying with a drug lord at the national penitentiary? Is Iyengar aware of how the national penitentiary turned into the ""Bilibid Hilton"" of the drug lords and became the number one source of meth/shabu in the country during De Lima's watch as head of the Department of Justice that oversees the prisons in the Philippines?Iyengar did not mention in his article that nearly 600,000 drug pushers/users surrendered within Duterte's first 6 weeks in office, and the average number of killings per day has gone down from 35 to 20. Why indeed should he bother to mention these facts? They don't fit with the fiction he and Time magazine want to promote.Communications Secretary Martin Andanar should sit down with the foreign correspondents in the Philippines and educate them on what is really going on. He should show them what a crazed shabu addict is capable of doing, like stabbing a 22-year-old nurse 19 times in her bedroom because he was looking for cash to pay for his next fix. Better yet, Andanar should arrange a free one-week stay at the Bilibid Hilton for these foreign journalists. It will be the most unforgettable sponsored junket they will ever experience.Here's the link to Iyengar's article. His Twitter handle is on it. All Filipinos on Twitter should give him a piece of their minds, and show him that the Time logo can't razzle-dazzle them into giving up their capacity to think for themselves.http://time.com/4462352/rodrigo-duterte-drug-war-drugs-philippines-killing/?xid=tcoshareMake no mistake about it. The Western media has been mobilized to demonize Duterte and make foreign investors lose confidence. Andanar's team should beef up their ranks. The government channel and the Philippine News Agency are not being maximized to disseminate real information, so the yellow media and the Western media with their vested interests are filling up the vacuum.--------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"1. He is the only person that understands that Filipinos must fix their own country. (America, China, and Korea are not going to fix the Philippines).2. Intellect is not the problem in the Philippines it is discipline. Many OFWs go work in America and change their behavior in our country. This country needs someone to stop the not caring attitude about breaking laws.3. He actually knows the problems of the poor. The fact that during a debate was the first time that two candidates pretended or did not know t healthcare and the 6 month job termination practice problems exist is very scary.I would vote for Grace Poe, if she was not too much like our current president Obama with no plans to enforce discipline or her goals.------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"A huge Pacific storm parked itself over Southern California and unloaded, ravaging roads, opening sinkholes and leading to the deaths of at least three people, eased off Saturday, February 18. But it was only a temporary reprieve as new storms took aim farther north.The National Weather Service predicted drying weather through Sunday followed by the return of wet weather in the region. But while flash-flood watches for Southern California were canceled, Northern California and the San Francisco Bay Area were facing a weekend return of heavy rain and winds that lashed them earlier in the week before the storm moves out. Authorities said the San Joaquin River is reaching flood stage, and they are warning residents in Manteca to be ready to evacuate in case it reaches dangerous levels.“Stronger southerly winds and widespread flooding will be likely as an atmospheric river (of moisture) takes aim somewhere along the central California Coast,” a weather statement warned.The approaching rain could cause more problems in the far north, where damage to spillways of the Lake Oroville dam forced the evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend.The California Department of Water Resources, however, said Saturday night that the level of Lake Oroville continues to fall despite the stormy weather, and the amount of water flowing down the spillway continues to be cut. The amount of water flowing down the spillway has been reduced to 55,000 cubic feet per second, the department said. Earlier this week, outflows were at nearly 100,000 cubic feet per second.Meanwhile, authorities up and down the state were dealing with the fallout, including overflowing creeks, mudslide threats in foothill areas denuded by previous fires, road collapses and hundreds of toppled trees in neighborhoods.Northwest of Sacramento, nearly 200 people were evacuated Saturday as overflowing creeks turned the town of Maxwell into a brown pond, with some homes getting 2 feet of water. Fire Chief Kenny Cohen said nearly 100 homes and the elementary school filled with a couple inches of water before the water began receding. The area received about 3 inches of rain as of Saturday morning.No injuries were reported.Cheri Azevedo said her garage had 2 feet of water, but her home had been spared Saturday. Others on her block and nearby were not as lucky, as all of them were evacuated.“It is heartbreaking,” she told the San Francisco Chronicle.Southern California appeared to dodge any major disasters, but in the desert town of Victorville, several cars were washed down a flooded street, and one man was found dead in a submerged vehicle after others were rescued, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Eric Sherwin said.And in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles, a man was electrocuted when a tree falling in heavy rain downed power lines that hit his car.On Saturday, searchers found the body of a man in his 20s who was swept down a rain-swollen gully in Thousand Oaks a day earlier. KCBS-TV reported (http://cbsloc.al/2kKp8cv) that the body was found in Arroyo Conejo Creek. Three other people stranded by the water were rescued.In the Studio City area of Los Angeles, a sinkhole swallowed two cars, the second on live TV as viewers watched it teeter on the edge before plunging in. One driver was taken to the hospital in fair condition.Inland at the Cajon Pass, the shoulder of Interstate 15 crumbled and sent a parked firetruck spilling over the side, but no one was hurt. The California Department of Transportation estimated emergency repairs to the freeway would cost $3 million.",1

"THE CEREMONY was intended to honor their loved ones but the relatives hardly looked appeased.Exactly a year after their deaths, no less than President Aquino conferred the highest military awards—the Medal of Valor and the Medal of Distinguished Conduct—to the 44 Special Action Force (SAF) commandos killed in “Oplan Exodus,” the operation to take down international terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias Marwan in Mamasapano, Maguindanao province.But there was no trace of joy, relief or gratitude in the family members who Monday received the posthumous awards at the Philippine National Police headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, on Monday morning.One pair after another, the relatives went up the stage at the Camp Crame Multipurpose Center, wearing formal Filipiniana attire and stony or somber expressions.Hardly any eye contactThey hardly made eye contact with the President—much less smiled—as he handed them the medals and framed certificates.Six of the families were conspicuously absent in the ceremonies—three of the SAF 44 were not represented at all. Another three were represented only by their classmates from the SAF.The commemoration of the tragedy comes amid complaints from some of the SAF 44’s beneficiaries that they have not been receiving the benefits promised them by the government.It also comes amid reports that some of the families had been pressured into attending the awarding ceremonies.Aside from the SAF commandos, 17 Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas, five Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and three civilians were killed during the fire fight.Tabdi’s infant sonThe ceremonies were attended at least by the immediate kin of the two Medal of Valor awardees. Receiving the medal for ChiefInsp. Gednat Tabdi, from Benguet province, was his wife and his brother. Tabdi’s brother carried to the stage Tabdi’s infant son, who was not born yet when Oplan Exodus happened.Mr. Aquino, in his speech during the ceremonies, hailed Tabdi, the team leader of the SAF 84th Special Action Company, which acted as the “main assault” during Oplan Exodus, for “leading the team in facing the enemy forces, even if they were outnumbered.”“[Tabdi’s] courage served as the strength and inspiration of his comrades to survive certain death,” the President said.Receiving the Medal of Valor for PO2 Romeo Cempron, from the 55th Special Action Company in Zamboanga province, was his wife and his mother.No surrenderThe President, in his speech, heaped praise on Cempron: “Despite being surrounded by more or less 700 enemies, PO2 Cempron fought fiercely. Until the end, he did not surrender. When he ran out of bullets and no longer had any firearms left, he used his own body to shield his comrades from the bullets.”Cempron was originally slated to be posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor during the 114th PNP anniversary in August last year, but his name was removed from the original awardees’ list, allegedly on orders of Malacañang.Of the 42 slain commandos who were posthumously conferred the Medal of Distinguished Conduct, three—Insp. Rennie Tayrus, SPO1 Lover Inocencio and PO2 Nicky Nacino—were not represented at all.Three other Medal of Distinguished Conduct awardees—Chief Insp. Max Jim Tria, PO2 Mark Lory Clemencio and PO3 Franklin Danao—were represented not by any kin, but by SAF classmates.Five other SAF commandos, who were wounded in Oplan Exodus, were also conferred the Medal of Distinguished Conduct, but their names were no longer announced “due to security matters,” said the PNP spokesperson, Chief Supt. Wilben Mayor.Earlier, however, the National Police Commission had revealed that one of the five commanders was Supt. Raymund Train, the team leader of Oplan Exodus. Train was not present during the awarding ceremonies.Twenty-five other SAF survivors in the fire fight earlier received special promotions, according to a Malacañang statement.In an eight-minute speech, the President did not only praise the heroism of the late SAF team members but also spoke about the government’s “continuing quest for justice” for the departed PNP personnel.Noting “justice delayed is justice denied,” Mr. Aquino lamented that like the families of the fallen commandos, “I myself get impatient with the slow pace of the justice system in the country.”His administration, he said, was “doing its best to seek justice (for the fallen SAF members).”At the same time, he urged Congress to study closely the Philippine National Police law, particularly any provisions that blocked the immediate imposition of penalties for erring governments officials who were remiss in performing their duties.Not following orders“We should prevent a repeat of tragedies resulting from incidents where certain officials did not follow the orders of their superiors,” he said.The President did not name names, but Palace sources, who asked not to be named for lack of authority to speak to media, said he was apparently referring to suspended SAF Director Getulio Napeñas, who was relieved of his post shortly after the Mamasapano incident.Napeñas reportedly ignored ceasefire mechanisms between the government and the MILF.He later claimed his men could have survived if military reinforcements and rescue teams arrived at the clash site immediately.The former SAF chief admitted that he did not inform both the Army and the MILF about the operation to get Marwan because he did not trust both organizations supposedly after a series of compromised operations.Continuing assistanceOn Monday, Mr. Aquino also vowed to continue providing assistance to the families of the SAF commandos.The government has, so far, provided more than P151 million in financial aid to these families, according to Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr.“From tuition and housing aid to healthcare, livelihood and employment assistance, the government continues to extend support not only to their immediate families but also to other beneficiaries,” presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda told reporters.Meeting with familiesAfter the PNP event, the President had a private meeting with the families, their third in the past 12 months.“Their first meeting was held at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, on Jan. 30, 2015, followed by another meeting sometime in February last year,” Coloma recalled.Last year, the President declared Jan. 30 a National Day of Mourning to honor the SAF commandos.FalloutThe fallout from the otherwise successful counterterrorism operation derailed the peace process between the government and the MILF, endangering the passage of the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), the fate of which in Congress continues to hang in the balance.The Mamasapano massacre also dealt the biggest blow to Mr. Aquino’s popularity with his numbers dropping to an all-time low after the debacle.The Senate committee on public order’s report on the debacle called the death of the 44 SAF troopers a “massacre” and found the President ultimately responsible for the disaster as it recommended criminal charges against both MILF members and PNP officials.Tomorrow, the Senate panel, chaired by Sen. Grace Poe, a presidential aspirant, is scheduled to reopen its investigation of the Mamasapano incident to tackle “possibly new evidence” on the clash.Unlearn dualismThe Mamasapano tragedy has “brought out many Filipinos’ long-stemmed antipathy and discrimination toward the Muslim-Filipino community,” said Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Teresita Quintos-Deles.Deles on Monday said “we must unlearn this dualism so we can move beyond our superficial analyses to a more discerning view of the peace process and our stakes in it.”In a statement, she noted that “the unfortunate incident in Mamasapano, which plunged the nation in deep grief, showed the fragility of the path to peace.”“The forcible deconstruction triggered by the tragedy compels us to a reconstruction, a recovery, a rethinking that must go deep and far and wide if we are to do justice to the truth and the pursuit for peace,” she said.Deles also said, “the bloodbath at Mamasapano does not debunk the imperative of peace. On the contrary, it tells us and may I paraphrase the poet E.E. Cummings, that of peace, we must be more careful than of anything else.”“It is a beacon, but it is also a fragile flower. It lives in the hearts of men and women but, stunted, it can also turn toxic,” she added. ",1
"Facing intense criticism resulting from the laglag bala scheme at Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), President NoyNoy Aquino says it’s not a big deal considering what has happened in the U.S.Laglag bala is reportedly an airport scam wherein bullets are planted in bags of unsuspecting passengers for the purpose of extortion.“These are isolated cases, and involve only tiny bullets,” Aquino said.“I wish the media would do their homework so that they know that a much bigger scheme involving more than just tiny bullets has happened in the United States in the past,” Aquino added, referring to this video released by Malacañang’s press office:",0
"Philippine National Police Director General chief Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa responded on Senator Franklin Drilon remarks that the head of the PNP acted like a ‘kanto boy’ when he defended the cops behind the alleged ‘Secret Jail’ in Manila Police District Station one.Bato who grew in a poor family in Mindanao admitted that he’s one of the kanto boys until he entered the prestigious Philippine Military Academy.“They can call me a kanto boy, sabi nila kanto boy daw ang aking sagot sa tanong na iyon. Kanto boy, it’s okay with me. They can call me kanto boy. Totoo man talaga, naging kanto boy ako noon. Hindi lang ako nakapasok ng PMA, baka kanto boy ako hanggang ngayon. Okay lang, Call me kanto boy,” Dela Rosa said.He said that Drilon should not look down on “kanto boys” or the people who always hanging in the streets.Bato explained that not all ‘kanto boys’ are bad guys because there are also some rich and educated people like Senator Franklin Drilon that also doing wrong things.But remember… hindi lahat ng kanto boy masasama. At hindi lahat ng mayayaman, learned, educated na mga tao, mabubuti. Wag mong ismolin ang isang taong kanto boy dahil hindi lahat ng kanto boy, masama,”The PNP chief also said that kanto boys are the one who always responded first when there’s an accident in the streets.“For all you know mamaya magkakaroon kayo ng vehicular accident diyan, ‘yung kanto boy pa makakasave ng buhay ninyo. ‘Wag niyong ismolin ang kanto boy,”Yesterday, Senate Minority leader Franklin Drilon criticized PNP chief Dela Rosa after hearing his statements on the ‘Secret Jail’“Parang kanto boy, parang hindi chief PNP,” Drilon said.",0

It was home to plenty of liquid water and lakes at least 3.6 billion years ago.Scientists are eager to find signs of contemporary water, because such discoveries are key to unlocking the mystery of whether life ever formed on Mars in its ancient past, or if it might persist today.“This is a stunning result that suggests water on Mars is not a temporary trickle like previous discoveries but a persistent body of water that provides the conditions for life for extended periods of time,” said Alan Duffy, an associate professor at Swinburne University in Australia, who was not involved in the study.Being able to access water sources could also help humans survive on a future crewed mission to Earth’s neighboring planet.This particular lake, however, would be neither swimmable nor drinkable, and lies almost a mile deep (1.5 kilometers) beneath the icy surface in a harsh and frigid environment.Some experts are skeptical of the possibility since the lake is so cold and briny, and mixed with a heavy dose of dissolved Martian salts and minerals.The temperature is likely below the freezing point of pure water, but can remain liquid due to the presence of magnesium, calcium, and sodium.“This is a discovery of extraordinary significance, and is bound to heighten speculation about the presence of living organisms on the Red Planet,” said Fred Watson of the Australian Astronomical Observatory.“Caution needs to be exercised, however, as the concentration of salts needed to keep the water liquid could be fatal for any microbial life similar to Earth’s,” added Watson, who was not involved in the research.– Radar detection –The tool is called the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS), and was designed to find subsurface water by sending radar pulses that penetrate the surface and ice caps.MARSIS “then measures how the radio waves propagate and reflect back to the spacecraft,” said the study.These reflections “provide scientists with information about what lies beneath the surface.”A team of researchers led by Roberto Orosei of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Bologna, Italy, surveyed a region called Planum Australe, located in the southern ice cap of Mars, from May 2012 until December 2015.A total of 29 sets of radar samplings showed a “very sharp change in its associated radar signal,” allowing scientists to map the outlines of the lake.“The radar profile of this area is similar to that of lakes of liquid water found beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets on Earth, suggesting that there is a subglacial lake at this location on Mars,” said the report.Researchers said they are not sure how far down it goes, but may be around three feet (one meter) deep.– Confirmation needed –“This is the first body of water it has detected, so it is very exciting,” David Stillman, a senior research scientist in the Department of Space Studies at Southwest Research Institute in Texas, told AFP in an email.However, Stillman, who was not involved in the research, said another spacecraft, or other instruments, need to be able to confirm the discovery.He noted that a higher-frequency radar instrument made by the Italian space agency, SHARAD, on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launched in 2005, has been unable to detect subsurface water.“It is strange that SHARAD cannot confirm this discovery. In fact, SHARAD cannot penetrate through the ice here and no one understands why it can’t,” Stillman said.“This suggests that something strange is going on here. Thus, I’m skeptical about this discovery.”But researchers are excited about the potential for future finds, because if liquid water could be found at Mars’ south pole, it might be elsewhere too.“There’s nothing special about this location other than the MARSIS radar on the Mars Express spacecraft is most sensitive to that region meaning there are likely similar water deposits below the ground all across Mars,” said Duffy.",1

"Last year, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) officially declared ‘selfies’ as a mental disorder, calling it Selfitis, defined as the passive-aggressive urge to take a photo of one’s self and posting it on social media.Today, the APA downgraded Selfitis to a potential life saver, thanks to a news camerawoman who took the time to snap a selfie and, in the process, save a life.Dolores Gillham, a photographer for CBS2 and KCAL9, was taking a selfie when she heard a man cry our for help. As she took a second selfie, she heard another cry for help. She then contacted her TV station which in turn called for rescue help.The rest is history. The driver of a car that plunged off the the Angeles Crest Highway was rescued by helicopter and taken to a nearby hospital where he is now recovering.So the next time you’re driving through a national forest or enjoying the view at a ski resort, go ahead and take a selfie or two. You might end up saving a life.And no one will think of you as having a mental disorder. Not even the APA!",0
"This lack of disaster preparedeness in a country that is the most disaster prone in the world highlights just how fucked up/utterly insane/inhumanely insensitive/ terminally stupid (pick one) generations of our leaders have been. That we allow them to grandstand after every disaster and bullshit us with the ""Filipino is resilient"" line instead of coming at them with fire. guns and pitchforks is equally a disaster makes us insane.I don't think the Philippines has had a year where no one has died due to a disaster. Our leaders lack of a clear disaster preparedness program is contributing to literally killing us.I don't know about you but one of the reasons why people agreed to be governed and go into a social contract is so that the government can protect the people, here lead disaster preparedness efforts. But yeah the Philippines is a society where it is a war of a person against every other person. In short, bahala na kayo dyan….kkb….ang mamatay ng dahil sayo, pwera ako.Just some suggestions:1. Stop politicizing disaster preparedness and response.2. Create a government agency specializing in disaster preparedness and response. Insulate this agency from politics by paying its members well, hiring the required experts, maybe even banning members of the disaster preparedness agency from running for office.3. Buy PAGASA and PHIVOCS state of the art shit that they need do get their job done. Pay them well too.4. Create shelters for each municipality/city.5. Educate people.Dammit, we're dying out here.------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"Divorce is a more complicated issue than gay marriage, it would involve custody battles involving poverty stricken Filipino's that could NEVER be counted on to pay 'court ordered' child support, and so warrants of arrest would be in the 100's of thousands. It would literally choke the legal system to a standstill, thus adding millions of peso's more debt to the already over-burdened/broke as a bad joke legal system. It would also create a nation of fugitives. But that is never spoken of, it's always said that the Filipino's 'family values' (that keeps families together) that is always heard as the argument AGAINST divorce, but it's not really why there is no divorce in this backwards ass country.Gay marriage, on the other hand, only creates court fees and administration costs that will add to the public coffers. The coffers that can be in turn raided by the mayor's and various other public officials close enough to get in on the action. Expect gay marriage to happen for 'plus side' monetary reason's and NO divorce laws to be passed for the exact opposite reason.IT'S FASHIONABLY consistent with the corrupt nature of the entire society.--------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"The Negros Occidental Police Provincial Office (Nocppo) has reported a decrease of 64.42 percent in index crimes and 71.39 percent in non-index crimes in the first two months of 2018 compared to the figures for the same period last year.Statistics released by the Nocppo on Wednesday showed that for the months of January and February this year, only 185 incidents of index crimes were recorded compared to 551 incidents in 2017.Index crimes are offenses against persons and properties, including murder, homicide, physical injury, robbery, theft, and rape.For non-index crimes, which are violations of special laws and ordinances, recorded were 237 incidents in the first two months this year as against 826 incidents last year.The most common cases include violations of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and R.A. 10591 or the Comprehensive Law on Firearms and Ammunition as well as R.A. 9287 for illegal gambling.Senior Supt. Rodolfo Castil Jr., police provincial director, said the decrease in crime statistics could be attributed to the Negros Occidental police’s massive campaign against criminality through the weekly enhanced managing police operation.It is also a result of intensified police patrol and visibility operations, and the return of anti-illegal drugs campaign, he added.Castil also acknowledged the cooperation of Negrenses in the campaign of the Philippine National Police against crimes and terrorism to make the province a safer place to live, work, and do business.Earlier, the Bacolod City Police Office also reported a decrease of by 27.3 percent in crime incidents during the month of February.In the past month, total crimes totaled to only 229, or 86 incidents less than last year’s 315 incidents for the same period.Senior Superintendent Francisco Ebreo, officer-in-charge of BCPO, said the marked decrease in the eight focus crimes could also be attributed to the effective application of enhanced managing police operation.",1

"President Duterte on Monday threatened to charge local officials of Boracay with serious neglect of duty for “creating” an environmental “disaster” in the world-famous resort.Mr. Duterte also said he had given Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu the authority to “destroy” establishments on the island that violate environmental and health regulations.“I will charge you with serious neglect of duty for making Boracay a sewer pool. Boracay from afar is beautiful [but] you swim in Boracay and you stink with shit,” he said in a speech during the inauguration of the Malasakit Help Desk at Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City.The President blamed the “local governments and the people” in Boracay for the environmental degradation of the 1,032-hectare island.“You allowed the building of structures overlapping the coastline and already reaching the sea, which is not really allowed,” he said.“You allowed buildings constructed without proper sewer or sewage. That is yours. That’s you. You created a disaster there,” he said.Mr. Duterte noted that garbage was just about 25 meters away from the shore.“All the hotels have no [sewage treatment]. Your water goes directly to the toilet, to the flush and to the water and then [you say it’s worth] billions,” he added.“They say its earning millions … all structures there are worth billions. You know, I don’t give a shit. Either they will clean it up or I will close it permanently.”",1

"Repent, resign or die.That was the message mayors, bused in batches to Malacañang, got during expletive-laced group meetings with President Duterte on Wednesday, according to participants.The President brandished a purported list of officials—including mayors, legislators and barangay captains—but the mayors had no opportunity to check if they were on it, according to one source.In a text message, Mayor Krisel Lagman Luistro of Tabaco City in Albay said: “The President warned us that those involved in drugs should stop or face the consequences. He specifically said that he will kill whoever is involved. It was fair warning.”The President’s spokesperson, Ernesto Abella, declined to give details of the meetings, which began shortly after noon and were still going on by early evening.Abella said the President intended to have a “conversation” with the mayors, and it was safe to assume that the narcotics trade was among the topics to be tackled.“He has not really met with the mayors in order to directly discuss his positions, especially regarding criminality, crime and drugs. It’s safe to assume that would be part of the conversation,” Abella told reporters.He said he would describe the meeting as a “dialogue between the President and his executives.”Mr. Duterte met the mayors clustered according to regions. They were brought to Malacañang by bus, shuttled from the Philippine International Convention Center in Pasay City.On Monday, Mr. Duterte warned local chief executives to steer clear of the trade in “shabu,” or the hugely popular crystal meth.He said those involved in the drug trade should either resign “or make a clean breast of everything, come up with a clean nose.”“I will talk to them. With the thick document I showed you, I will tell them, ‘Look for your name there, mayor, you son of a bitch. If your name is there, you will have a problem. I will really kill you.’”“As long as I’m President, these big shabu dealers will die and the next batch would really be these mayors. I will call them and lock them up,” he said.Those whose names are on his narcolist would have a problem, he said.Three mayors from Quezon province, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the President did not link anyone in the group, mostly from Luzon, to the drug trade.“He was cool. But he was in his natural self … cursing and all,” one mayor said in a telephone interview.“At least in our batch, the President did not call out any name. He just kept on talking. He asked for our support in the drug war and in solving the country’s problems,” the mayor said.The Inquirer sources said they were asked to leave their mobile phones with security personnel before they proceeded to a hall where the President met them.Of the 39 municipal mayors and two city mayors of Quezon, only four were not able to attend the meeting, the third source said.“Duterte was jovial. He was even joking during his 30- to 40-minute speech in our batch. But he did his usual cursing,” said another mayor, also from Quezon.But in a meeting with another group, also from Luzon, the President was described as in “a very bad mood.”“Mayors engaging in illegal drug trade and corruption were cursed and threatened,” a mayor in that group said in a text message in Filipino.The source said Mr. Duterte again mentioned Vicente Loot, a former police officer and now mayor of Daanbantayan in Cebu, as among those involved.“He was really angry at Loot,” the source said, adding that the President also named nine judges on his narcolist.Shoot-to-kill ordersMayor Anida Dimaukom, of Datu Saudi Ampatuan town in Maguindanao, did not attend the meeting, according to her brother-in-law, Councilor Zayton Dimaukom.Anida is formerly the town’s vice mayor. She replaced her husband, Samsudin Dimaukom, who was killed in an alleged shootout with police in North Cotabato in October. The President had linked the couple to illegal drugs.During a meeting with one group from the Visayas, the President said he had directed the chiefs of police of towns and cities to shoot mayors involved in drugs.“He said he will protect the policemen and even grant them pardon if they will be convicted,” a participant said. “We were silent when the President said this while we were at the Rizal Hall. But many of us felt that we were threatened.”“He said the list was validated but we were not shown the list and we do not know how we can check if we were mistakenly included. We might be shot by our police chief,” the mayor said.The President also cited slain Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. in Leyte and Iloilo City Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog who, he said, was close to a slain alleged drug lord, Melvin Odicta.Mabilog, who was at the meeting, kept shaking his head, according to the mayor seated near him.Cooperate or else“We have to be cooperative or else we will be included in the list,” Mayor Therese Sitoy-Cho of Cordova town in Cebu said, referring to a thick folder Mr. Duterte showed.Mr. Duterte told the mayors that he would look into how each of them spent their intelligence funds and expected that it would go to the police.“He wants our areas cleared of illegal drugs within the year,” Cho said.The President reportedly told the mayors that the folder contained a “complete and verified list” of all local government officials, “from mayors down to barangay officials,” involved in illegal drugs.According to Cho, there were a few mayors absent during the meeting, though she did not know who.Referring to mayors who failed to attend the meeting, the President reportedly said: “noted mo” (you are noted).“This is not an order, this is a plea. Cooperate lang gyud mo para way sabod (Just cooperate to avoid trouble),” Cho quoted the President as saying.",1
"LA TRINIDAD, Benguet — Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu on Monday ordered the police and military to enforce a ban on pocket mining in Cordillera after landslides killed 35 small-scale miners and members of their families in Itogon town, Benguet province, at the height of Typhoon “Ompong” on Saturday.President Rodrigo Duterte, speaking at a situation briefing here on Monday, repeated his call to shut down all mines in the country following the deadly landslides.Cimatu gave the order after a massive landslide at Barangay Ucab in Itogon pulled down shanties, old bunkhouses and a chapel. The bunkhouses were once used by Benguet Corp.The fatalities were miners and members of their families who had taken shelter in the area from Ompong’s winds and rains.Around 40 people remained missing as landslides also struck Loacan, Virac and Ampucao villages and the poblacion in Itogon.Hundreds of rescuers using shovels and picks were searching in the red mud for those still missing. On Monday, two bodies and body parts belonging to a third fatality were recovered.Itogon Mayor Victorio Palangdan said at a news conference that of the 40 people thought buried, there’s a “99 percent [chance] that they really are all dead.” Ompong has killed at least 65 people in the country.Total ban in CordilleraCimatu also canceled temporary small-scale mining permits and imposed a total ban on illegal mining in Cordillera.“I learned that most of the pocket miners were not from Benguet but from Ifugao. So we sent them back to their province,” he said.Informed by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) that 10 mining operations had been given temporary small-scale mining contracts, Cimatu added: “By virtue of what happened, I am revoking those permits effective today.”The ban covers about 10,000 small-scale miners in Itogon town.Suspended for nowPresidential spokesperson Harry Roque explained Cimatu’s order to mean that all small-scale mining operations would be suspended and those with permits would have their permits suspended for now.At the situation briefing here, President Duterte blamed mining and the “inroads of civilization” for the landslides.“If I were to try to do my thing, I will close all mining in the Philippines,” the President said.The Chamber of Mines of the Philippines (COMP) said illegal small-scale mining “does not employ the same stringent safety practices required of legitimate large-scale mining operations.”Member companies of COMP that have permits in Cordillera include Benguet Corp., Philex Mining Corp. and Lepanto Consolidated Mining Co.Officials have said that gold mines tunneled by big mining companies or by unauthorized individuals and small outfits have made the hillsides unstable and more prone to landslides.Tens of thousands of small-time miners from the lowlands have established communities in high-risk areas like the foothills of Itogon.Area declared geohazardBenguet Corp. said it had issued “numerous notices to small-scale miners to vacate the area since the 1990s” after the MGB declared the area a geohazard. The mining company has stopped its operations in the area since the late 1990s.Cimatu said a “Minahang Bayan” (People’s Mines) must first be established in Benguet before small-scale mining could resume.The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has yet to act on proposed sites for Minahang Bayan, including an idle open-pit mine in Benguet.Alternative livelihoodCimatu’s decision has alarmed Benguet officials since thousands of families rely on pocket mining.Mayor Palangdan asked for a meeting with the DENR secretary to help choose viable areas for Minahang Bayan.Benguet Gov. Crescencio Pacalso said he would have to convene various agencies to determine how to deal with the loss of livelihood.Roque said the government would provide alternative income opportunities for the small-scale miners to be affected.At the Cordillera police headquarters in Camp Dangwa, officials told Francis Tolentino, President Duterte’s political adviser, that they were keeping a close watch on the topside of the Ucab landslide because of concerns the rest of the hill would give way.Abandoned tunnelAn abandoned tunnel of an old mine lies beneath the area that collapsed, according to Mayor Palangdan.A total of 145 families were evacuated from erosion-prone areas of Itogon on Monday, adding to the 78 families who heeded a directive to leave the hill before Ompong struck, said Janet Armas, Cordillera director of the DSWD.She said the DSWD would provide assistance to the families who would lose their livelihood due to Cimatu’s order.",1
"President Donald Trump on Monday floated the idea of holding his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Koreas.That’s where South Korean President Moon Jae-in met Kim on Friday, the first time a North Korean leader has visited south of the demarcation line that divides the rival nations.“Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!” Trump tweeted, referring to buildings located on the southern side of the DMZ.It’s the heaviest hint that Trump has dropped about the possible location for his planned face-to-face with Kim. Trump said over the weekend that the time and location of the meeting with Kim, slated for May or early June, are being set.It would be the first U.S.-North Korean leadership summit in more than six decades of hostility since the 1950-53 Korean War. Trump has previously said that five locations were being considered, but on Friday said the choice had been narrowed to two or three. He hasn’t specified other possible locations, fueling speculation on where would be acceptable to both sides. Other options might be in Europe, Southeast Asia, Mongolia or even on a ship in international waters.Trump on Friday claimed credit for the inter-Korean summit, which has spurred hopes of peace on the Korean Peninsula after a torrid 2017 when North Korea rapidly advanced its development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The president now faces a burden in helping turn the Korean leaders’ bold but vague vision for peace into reality.Kim and Moon pledged to seek a formal end to the Korean War by year’s end and to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. According to Seoul, Kim told Moon that he would shut down his country’s only known nuclear testing site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process.South Korean officials also cited Kim as saying he would be willing to give up his nuclear programs if the United States commits to a formal end to the Korean War and a pledge not to attack the North. Kim had already suspended his nuclear and missile tests while offering to put his nukes up for negotiations. But there is still deep skepticism over whether Kim is truly willing to negotiate away the nukes that his country has built after decades of struggle.",1
"BUSINESSMAN Kim Wong, among those being investigated for alleged involvement in an $81-million money laundering scheme, failed to appear in a Senate hearing Tuesday because he is seeking medical treatment abroad.Wong was one of the resource persons invited to the hearing after his name cropped up in relation to an investigation of the Anti-Money Laundering Council.At the hearing, the committee secretariat said Wong’s lawyer sent a letter saying his client would be unable to join the inquiry because he has been out of the country since March 4 for medical treatment.The secretariat did not specify the illness for which Wong sought treatment.The committee was also told that four other persons being investigated in connection with the scheme and whom the Senate was supposed to invite could not be located because they had fictitious addresses.The four are Michael Cruz, Jessie Lagrosas, Alfred Vergara and Enrico Vasquez.

It is where the Clark International Airport, the industrial zone, the duty-free shops, and the golf course, among others, are located.Aquino stopped short of explaining the reason or need to relocate Camp Olivas, but it is no secret to newsmen that the present location of the PRO-3 headquarters is prone to severe flooding during the rainy season.",1
"Malacanang said President Rodrigo Duterte continued to enjoy “excellent” satisfaction rating because of his administration’s propoor programs despite a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey that showed his net satisfaction rating dropped by 12 points.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said “it is noteworthy to mention” that the President’s satisfaction rating was still “very good” at +58 and remained strong in Mindanao.He said that in Luzon and Visayas the President continued to enjoy very good satisfaction ratings.Roque made the remarks in reaction to the SWS survey which was conducted from March 23 to 27.“We remain grateful to our people for giving the Duterte administration a ‘very good’ +58 net satisfaction rating,” Roque said in a statement.Roque cited public appreciation for the government’s help for victims of disasters where it got an “excellent” rating.He attributed the President’s high satisfaction ratings to the administration’s initiatives to help the poor, rebuild Marawi City, build and maintain infrastructure, protect migrant Filipino workers, fight terrorism and protect human rights.Roque said the government would continue to “champion the interests of the greatest number of our countrymen, particularly in redoubling our efforts in ensuring that no Filipino family will ever be hungry.”",1
"VICE PRESIDENT Jejomar Binay may have lost his bid for the presidency but his family’s recapture of Makati City Hall means he remains to be a political force in the country, according to his erstwhile ally former Sen. Aquilino Pimentel Jr.Binay placed fourth in the presidential race based on the unofficial count of the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting.His daughter, former Makati Rep. Abigail Binay, won the mayoral race over Palace-backed Kid Peña, who served as acting mayor of the city for a year since the suspension and eventual dismissal from office of Jejomar Erwin Binay over corruption charges.Abigail Binay’s win reestablished her family’s foothold in City Hall and the city itself, after her husband, Luis Campos, became her successor in the House.Binay’s eldest daughter, Nancy Binay, has three years more to go as senator.Last weekend, Vice President Binay conceded defeat to Duterte and congratulated the Davao City mayor for winning the presidency. He also called for national unity.Pimentel, who broke ties with Binay during the height of the Senate investigation of corruption allegations against the Vice President, said the accusations should be dealt with frontally.He said that Binay’s general answer to the accusations against him as nothing more than politics was one of the major factors for his “downfall.”So is Binay’s political career over?“Dreams never die,” Pimentel said in a phone interview. “Considering he has established his control of Makati, at least in that level, he will still be a force to reckon with.”A De la Salle political science professor, Richard Heydarian, said the Binays would continue to play a role in Philippine politics.“I think for Binay himself, I doubt there will be a second act on the national level. But his family, and protégé daughter like Abby, will remain a force in Philippine politics,” Heydarian told the Inquirer, when asked if the Vice President could be considered politically dead after his devastating loss in the presidential race.Heydarian pointed out that Binay’s immunity from suit would expire after he steps down from office on June 30 and thus, he would be “vulnerable to imprisonment on grounds of corruption.”The Ombudsman has found Binay, like his son, criminally liable for the overpricing of Makati City Hall Building II on his watch.Heydarian said it was still unclear if the incoming Duterte administration would pursue charges against Binay.“In fact, toward the end of the race, we saw a more cordial interaction between Duterte and Binay. It’s possible that Duterte may prefer to push for national unity rather than divisive litigation against former high level officials. But it’s also possible that Binay may end up as the primary example of Duterte’s clean governance motto,” Heydarian said.",1
"The Associated Labor Unions (ALU) has rejected the wage board’s offer of a P16 increase, less than a tenth of the P184 additional daily pay the labor group is seeking.“We urge the wage board to be relevant and responsive to the needs of workers and their families by raising the workers’ daily pay to P675,” ALU spokesperson Alan Tanjusay said in a statement.Tanjusay said the workers who helped the country achieve consistently high economic growth through their toil and sweat did not deserve P16.‘Frustrating’“It’s frustrating for us to file a wage-increase petition every time but the wage board will offer only P10, P15 or P20. But ALU has to do this every time because millions of minimum wage earners are voiceless and powerless,” he added.The P16 is on top of the current P491 daily minimum wage that 6 million minimum wage earners in 17 cities and municipalities in Metro Manila are receiving.Tanjusay noted that during the public consultation on Thursday, the wage board announced it was amenable to grant P16 in the wake of the wage-increase petition filed by ALU after the effectivity period of the P491 daily minimum wage rate had lapsed on June 2.ALU filed on June 6 a petition for a P184 wage increase to restore the real value of P491, which it said had been eroded by 27 percent as of May.“Records from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and National Wages and Productivity Commission as of May 25, 2017, show the purchasing power of P491 is P357,” Tanjusay said.Sinking purchasing power“A sinking purchasing power of workers’ daily wage means lowering of the quality and quantity of nutritious food that is so vital to workers’ productivity at [their] work and to [their] families,” he said. “A lowered purchasing power will also affect the health of the children.”ALU placed at P1,200 the daily minimum amount needed by a family of five to meet its food and nonfood needs.The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said in 2015 that a family of five needed at least P6,329 monthly to meet its basic food needs and at least P9,064 to meet its basic food and nonfood needs.The PSA defines food threshold as the minimum income required to meet basic food needs and to satisfy the nutritional requirements set by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI).Poverty threshold is the minimum income required to meet basic nonfood needs, such as clothing, housing, transportation, health and education expenses.P12,517 income neededThe Trade Union of the Philippines, citing figures from the FNRI Food Poverty thresholds in April last year, said P12,517 was the monthly income needed to meet the basic food needs of a family of five.Tanjusay said ALU expected the wage board to announce the final decision on its wage petition next week.The wage board is composed of two representatives from employers’ groups, two from labor organizations and one each from the Department of Labor and Employment, the National Economic and Development Authority and the Department of Trade and Industry.",1
"support that Pashinian claims to have.Pashinian then called on demonstrators to cease their protests.In an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, party deputy head Armen Ashotyan reaffirmed the deal for the vote that is to be held Tuesday in parliament.“We had two criteria to assist any candidate. The first is a necessary threshold of signatures … The second is to calm down the situation on the streets, not blocking interstate roads, airports, etc.,” he said. “So the man who could cope with these criteria is considered to be Nikol Pashinian.”Ashotyan said if the streets stay calm “as agreed, we will assist his election.”Yet once Pashinian takes the post, Armenia’s political dynamics will become complicated. Ashotyan said the Republican party would “consider itself the opposition” despite retaining a majority of lawmakers in parliament.“In my personal opinion, there is no way of any cooperation with new political forces,” he said. “We will not be part of this government.”A stalemate could quickly rekindle demonstrators, whose actions over the past three weeks bolstered their confidence.“We paralyzed the whole country. We showed the authorities our strength and we should finish the revolution,” said 46-year-old businessman Tigran Ovsesian.The Yerevan protests began April 13 and spread to other parts of the country. Frustration with widespread poverty and corruption burst into anger over what demonstrators saw as longtime President Serzh Sargsyan’s power grab.Sargsyan, who was president for a decade, stepped down because of term limits but on April 17 was named prime minister. Under a shift in government structure, the premiership had become more powerful than the presidency.But as the protests against him attracted tens of thousands nightly in Yerevan’s central square, Sargsyan unexpectedly resigned just six days after being appointed prime minister.",1
"THE Court of Appeals (CA) has affirmed its own decision ordering the family of the late boxing promoter Rodolfo Nazario to pay former world featherweight champion Luisito Espinosa the remaining balance of his prize money.Nazario allegedly owed Espinosa, now based in the United States, at least P5.8 million plus interest that accrued from the time the case was filed in court several years ago after defending his World Boxing Council title in 1997 in South Cotabato.In a decision, the CA’s Special Fourth Division stood pat on its findings that no new arguments were presented to warrant the reversal of its earlier ruling.The appellate court denieda motion for reconsideration filed by surviving members of the Nazario family–Rodolfo’s wife, retired Supreme Court Justice Minita Chico-Nazario and children Roderick, Rommelius and Karen Patricia–who were impleaded in the case after the death of their patriarch.“However, we reiterate that the liability of the legal heirs of the deceased Rodolfo V. Nazario is limited to the value of inheritance which they received from the deceased,” the January 23, 2017 ruling that was released only recently said.The ruling was penned by Associate Justice Eduardo Peralta Jr. and concurred in by Associate Justices Sesinando Villon and Francisco Acosta.The CA had overturned the decision of the Manila Regional Trial Court dismissing Espinosa’s complaint that he filed against Nazario, as well as the other promoters of the fight, identified as former South Cotabato Governor Hilario de Pedro and Joselito Mondejar.Espinosa and his manager Joe Koizumi filed the case on May 26, 1998 against the promoters and organizers of the December 6 Koronadal fight where the “Golden Boy” successfully defended his title against Argentinean Carlos Rios.JOMAR CANLAS",1

"A quick stroll down memory laneThe Frustration of “The Other Side”Duterte the Murderer?President Duterte should be firm and say, “Arrest all drug pushers,” but he shouldn’t say, “I do not care about Human Rights (of criminals).”The Language of the Masses“Nakuha niya (Duterte) kasi ang lenggwahe ng masa… Kung likas kang Pilipino, tubong Pilipino ka… lalo na grassroots…mage-gets mo pati jokes niya e… nasasakyan…kaya ganoong kalawak ang mass base niya, really. Kasi nasasakyan nila, alam nila kapag nagjo-joke lang ‘yan, alam din nila kapag, ‘Oi, seryoso ‘yan,’ alam din nila kung nagbo-borderline (offensive) siya.”[Translation: He speaks the language of the masses. If you’re a common Filipino, especially if you’re from the grassroots, you’ll catch the drift, even his jokes. That’s how he got his massive mass base, really. Because the masses understand him. They know when he’s joking, they also know when he’s serious, they also know when he’s borderline (offensive).]Swaying Public OpinionFirst, stop pissing off the majority.Second, stop nitpicking his statements.Third, be sincere and straightforward.Did Duterte order the ""murders""?First, stop calling Duterte supporters names.Second, stop using his statements against him.Third, stop telling us that you’re on our side.ThinkingPinoy’s Bottom-lineI, ThinkingPinoy, am not a newsperson right now. I am just a lowly anonymous blogger who belongs to the masses. I am just a regular Filipino who writes about what I think. Nothing more and nothing less.

Help ThinkingPinoy stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help!Follow @iMthinkingPinoy Did you like this post? Help ThinkingPinoy stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help!You hate Duterte, I get it. I do not respect the fact that you hate Duterte, but I respect your right to hate him. Believing that he still doesn’t deserve to be the president despite a landslide win, you desperately want to bring him down. I get that too.But over and over you fail, and I am starting to feel bad for you. That’s why this time, I am going to help you do exactly what you want to do.Let me start by refreshing your memory about the first five attempts at destroying Rodrigo Duterte., there was the “P.I. Pope” issue in November 2015. It didn’t work because cursing is not a big deal for the poor masses where I belong [ TP: Tatang ], while the rich and middle class feel that there are more important issues to worry about., there was the “Rape Joke” issue [ TP: Distasteful ]. It didn’t work because a foul-mouthed president is better than one who coddles rapists [ TP: Jalosjos ]., there was the “BPI Julia Vargas” issue [ TP: BangkoSerye ]. It didn’t work because Duterte has gained the Teflon effect [ TP: Waiver Game ], the evidence turned out to be double hearsay [ TP: Sampalan ], and the evidence contradicts itself [ TP: Scenarios ]., there was the “PCOS” issue [ TP: Smartmatic ]. It didn’t work because Duterte’s lead is so large, (1) there’s no way people will believe he wouldn’t win and (2) the lead overwhelmed any potential cheating. Not for Bongbong Marcos, though [ TP: Obsolete ]., there was “Plan B”, where Duterte would have been removed through impeachment. It didn’t work as Duterte managed to secure 9 senator-allies, making the two-thirds majority required for conviction in an impeachment trial impossible to attain [ TP: Mark Villar ].Five major attempts and so far, none worked. These painful and repeated failures have frustrated many people, to a point where they just throw in the “disente” towel and go full blast.Rappler, the college sorority blog known for its hyper-opinionated bloggers [ TP: Pia Rañada ], won’t qualify as an example. Instead, I am talking about those who feigned impartiality in the past several months, only to amuse the public by crying like babies who saw Edgar Erice’s face.Just look at erstwhile respectable Professor Walden Bello who was caught, pants down, calling 91% of Filipinos ignorant and stupid [ Star Minda ] . He wasn’t sorry for it and he gloriously succeeded, in the succeeding days [ FB ], to reinforce his newly-built reputation for assholery.Then there’s Al Jazeera’s Jamela Alindogan who cheapened the deaths of fifteen soldiers [ FB ] in the war against the Abu Sayyaf by blaming it on Duterte’s supposed misdecision. It appears Alindogan expects that the Abu Sayyaf will talk peace with Duterte over tea.Yes, I chose to support Duterte in the May 2016 elections. However, there’s a part of me that feels sympathy for the opposition that has been repeatedly trying its best to destroy the man and repeatedly failing miserably time and time again.That’s why I am going to teach you how to destroy him, because I am starting to feel genuine pity for you guys.SERIOUSLY.You’re trying to destroy Duterte again and this time, it’s the EJK issue.You say Duterte is a mass murderer after the death of 2000 people during the war on drugs. Your ally, Sen. Leila de Lima, was so convinced of this despite her chronic failure to show – since 2009 – Duterte’s involvement in the Davao Death Squads [ TP: Ooh, Ronnie! ].De Lima called for a senate investigation, and everybody she invited from the Duterte camp attended. Two days’ worth of grandstanding was fruitless, as not a single testimony, not a single piece of evidence, showed that Duterte ordered those deaths [ TP: Chito Gascon ].Despite the lack of evidence, you still insist that he sanctions vigilante killings because you held him to his word. I think you will agree with TV5’s Atty Mel Sta. Maria when he said in Filipino yesterday [ Radyo5 ]:Adding Hontiveros’ statement that the president’s statements have “the force and effect of policy”, you are basically telling us that despite the lack of a formal announcement, his words against criminals de facto emboldened the police to kill suspects at will.This kind of reasoning is problematic because it does not resonate with the masses.Let me tell you why.Overanalyzing Duterte’s statements won’t work and the sooner you accept that reality, the better. I thought you’ve already learned that after the P.I. Pope scandal [ TP: Tatang ], but you didn’t. I thought you’ve learned that after the Rape Joke scandal [ TP:Jalosjos ], but you haven’t.We all speak Taglish, Duterte included. However, what mainstream media still doesn’t get is that Duterte speaks Taglish that matches the wavelength of the masses, especially those who grew up poor, underprivileged, the whole nine yards. This is starkly different from the sanitized, prim-and-proper Taglish that most wealthy and highly-educated Filipinos (or those pretending to be such) use. Luchi Cruz-Valdez brilliantly explained this point yesterday when she said [ Radyo5 ]:You know what, I actually think you do understand the language issue but you are still denying it. Yes, you have all the freedom to think whatever you’re thinking. However, the fact remains that engaging the masses means having to play in their arena, not yours.And what do you want? Sway their opinions to your favor.There’s one key concept here that you need to keep in mind: Public Opinion.That is, if you want to destroy Duterte, you need to destroy his public image. If you want to destroy his public image, you have to be able to communicate with the masses. You should not just aim for the masses to hear you, you should make them listen to you.We are not talking anymore about what’s the morally right way to speak. I’ll leave that to Rappler, the self-proclaimed morality police. Instead, I am talking about speaking in a way that people will actually listen.And this how you do it:No, I am not talking about the self-proclaimed “Silent Majority” because 9% by no means constitutes a majority. I am talking about the 40% who voted for him, plus the 51% who decided to support him after he won. If you continue calling us idiots, ignoramuses, retards, and the like, you might as well look forward to six more years of teeth-gnashing and hair-pulling.Whether you think he really meant it or not doesn’t matter: it’s how the masses interpret his statement that does. Instead of wondering why “the masses are so clueless”, you should ask why they caught his drift while you did not. Why? Making a big deal out of an otherwise simple statement will make the masses see you as a fool, and no one likes listening to fools.The masses know you don’t like Duterte so they would naturally be suspicious of everything you say. Just like in social media marketing, sincerity and empathy (or at least, what appears to be such) are the currencies of politics. People don’t like talking to people that they feel they need to second-guess. Yes, your need to second-guess Duterte’s words may be one of the reasons you didn’t vote for him, but the tables have turned after May 9th. The 91% percent’s need to second-guess your statements will just make your job harder to do.To make this easier to understand, let’s apply these three tips to the EJK issue, your sixth and latest attempt to kick him out of the national scene.The extrajudicial killings (EJK) issue, the sixth and latest attempt, shows a lot of promise, if done right.I am not against name-calling per se, but the truth of the matter is you can’t convince someone to change sides if the first thing you do is piss him off [ TP:Ed Lingao ]. If you continue displaying disdain for Duterte supporters, then you are just wasting precious time, money, and saliva.We, his supporters, admit that he has a foul mouth, but we believe that he more than makes up for it with real, tangible, and substantial results.Hence, use his actual actions instead. If you want to prove that Duterte is a mass murderer, show us that he actually ordered police to kill innocent people, or that he actually tolerated police abuses. You haven’t done that so far.You are not fooling anyone. As a Duterte supporter, I would rather hear someone talk smack about me in front of my face rather than hear someone who spews bullshit. Duterte won because of the things he did, and not by the way he talks. Hence, to destroy him, show evidence based on the things that really did, and not based from the things he said.Show us a policeman who killed an innocent but was subsequently pardoned. Give us a video or audio clip showing Duterte ordering cops to unlawfully kill people. Show us that saving a criminal’s life and saving our own lives are not mutually exclusive.Why? Because you haven’t shown any of those so far.Why? Because I have run out of patience for dealing with people like you.However, I am still trying to reach out to you because I want real opposition to the Duterte administration. And when I say “real”, I mean an opposition that actually makes sense to me and to the rest of the masses, not the kind of overreacting, self-entitled opposition that the country has today.Now, if you still don’t get what I mean, just avoid these 10 no-no’s:Because in as far as your political interests are concerned, doing any of these ten will do you more harm than good.In reaction to this article, you may say:Well, that's your problem, not mine. It's you who needs something from the masses, and not the other way around. But if you manage to do all these, then alright, let's talk. [ ThinkingPinoy",0

"A composite team of police and military intelligence agents arrested two suspected Islamic State (IS) sympathizers on Thursday in Laguna province and seized from them four firearms, two grenades, ammunition and improvised explosive devices.At a press conference in Camp Crame on Friday night, Philippine National Police chief Oscar Albayalde identified the alleged terrorists as Jimuel Dizon, alias “Amir”; and Eddie Boy Bermejo, alias “Abdullah.”Albayalde said that Dizon and Bermejo were “Balik-Islam” (converts to Islam) members of Suyuful Khilafa Fi Luzon, an affiliate of the Luzon-based Rajah Solaiman Movement (RSM).Valentine’s Day bombingFormed in 2002, RSM is suspected of involvement in several terror attacks, including the bloody 2005 Valentine’s Day bombing in Metro Manila.“They (Dizon and Bermejo) have been subject of our surveillance ever since. We are conducting follow-up operations … and our intelligence buildup on this group (RSM) is continuous,” Albayalde said.Operatives from the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, the local police, and military intelligence also confiscated a pair of black IS flags from the two suspects, who were arrested separately at their homes in subdivisions in Barangay Tagapo in Sta.

"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has lashed out at the “hypocrisy” of the West for closing borders to an exodus of refugees whom he said he would welcome to his country until it was “filled to the brim”.Commenting on the refugee exodus that has plagued Europe, Duterte said Western countries had failed those most in need and the Philippines, a developing country of 100 million, was willing to take them in.“They can always come here, and will be welcome here,” he said.“It’s all right. We will survive. I say send them to us. We will accept them. We will accept them. They are human beings.”In a collateral move, Duterte also announced that his administration will offer refugee status to all Filipino Americans trying to flee Donald Trump’s presidency.The election of Trump has prompted many Americans to plan their exodus to Canada, Europe and Asia.“There will be no questions asked,” Duterte said. “All that Filipino Americans need to do is to renounce their U.S. citizenship and come to the Philippines. He made it clear that his refugee status offer is open to all, including the FilAms who have been very critical of his administration.“Blood is thicker than politics,” Duterte added.",0
"Commission on Higher Education (CHED) officer-in-charge Prospero De Vera said that the free tuition law that now being enjoyed by the students of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) must be credited to President Rodrigo Duterte.De Vera said this during his interview with Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson.He explained that only President Rodrigo Duterte implemented the free tuition law.“Kaya ang credit dito ay talagang mapunta sa presidente dahil siya ang nangahas na subukan yung hindi sinubukan ng maraming nakaraang pangulo sa Pilipinas,” De Vera said.“Itong RA 10931 ang pinakamahalagang social justice legislation sa ating higher education. Kasi hindi na bagong ideya ito. Matagal ng hinihiling ng mga estudyante, ng mga pamilya na ilibre ang mga estudyante sa tuition at miscellaneous fees. Ang kinaiba lang noong nakaraang panahon, laging sinasabi, ‘hindi pwede, hindi kaya’. Ang pinagkaiba, nagkaroon ng Presidente Rodrigo Roa Duterte na sinabi niya, ‘gawin natin’, kaya nangyari sa administrasyong ito,” he added.The Republic Act No. 10931 or Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act, according to De Vera was already pushed before, but it was ignored by the past administrations.“Lahat naman ng dating pangulo binigyan ng pagkakataon na gumawa ng batas na ganyan. Ang kinaiba, ginawa sa administrasyong ito.”Even during the Aquino administration, the free tuition law was failed to implement because of lack of support.He also said that former senator Bongbong Marcos, senators Ralph Recto, Chiz Escudero and Win Gatchalian always asked him about the expenses on the free education because they’re the one who really pushed it.You can watch the interview below:Meanwhile, several netizens slammed some politicians who wanted to be credited in the free tuition law.In 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the free tuition law for 112 State Universities and Colleges.“Free tertiary education in SUCs is a very strong pillar or cornerstone of the President’s social development policy,” Deputy Executive Secretary Menardo Guevarra said.",0

"The military on Sunday said it was verifying reports the three Westerners and a Filipino woman who were abducted from Samal Island in Davao last week had been taken to Sulu.The Armed Forces of the Philippines said Sunday the reports remained unconfirmed, although it reported on Saturday the recovery in Jolo, Sulu, of a boat suspected to have been used by the kidnappers.“There is still no confirmation to the information (that the victims were taken to Sulu), but that is being continuously validated,” said Col. Restituto Padilla, spokesman for the AFP.In Zamboanga City, Brig. Gen. Allan Arrojado, commander of Joint Task Force Sulu, said there was no basis for saying the kidnap victims had been taken to Sulu.“Plain speculation, unless we get solid proof from reliable sources,” Arrojado told the Inquirer on Sunday.The military does not act on information from a single source, Arrojado added.“We need at least three to four confirmatory reports, then we start to validate,” he said.On Saturday, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte said he had received intelligence information the hostages, who were seized from the Holiday Oceanview resort hotel on Samal Island, had been taken to Sulu.Canadian tourists John Ridsdel and Robert Hall, Norwegian resort manager Kjartan Sekkingstad and Filipino Maritess Flor were seized from Oceanview late last Monday by 11 gunmen, who escaped in motorized outriggers.“They are already in Sulu. All sources indicate and all this information were consistent that they are in Sulu,” Duterte said.In exchangeDuterte, who on Friday offered himself to the kidnappers in exchange for their captives, said he had sent a message to the abductors seeking to negotiate the release of the victims.He also appealed to the kidnappers to be reasonable if it was a ransom that they wanted.They should not demand too much for the release of the captives, he said.Officials said hundreds of policemen and Army troops, backed by the Philippine Navy and Philippine Coast Guard, were chasing the kidnappers, with the operation concentrated on the mountains of the Davao region, where sightings of the gunmen and their captives had been reported.On Sunday, however, officials declined to say whether the operations remained in Davao or had shifted to Sulu following the recovery of a 25-meter suspected getaway boat in Jolo on Friday.Col. Noel Detoyato, AFP public affairs office chief, declined to say where exactly the operations were going on.“These are operational data. This might endanger our troops on the ground. Even if there is a general location, the enemy might pinpoint it,” Detoyato said.Capt. Alberto Caber, spokesman for the AFP Eastern Mindanao Command, said reports of sightings of the kidnappers and their captives were still being verified.Authorities were examining the boat found in Omar town, Sulu, to determine if it was the one used by the kidnappers.Arrojado said the boat was discovered on Saturday afternoon and appeared to have been sunk on purpose.A source from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) said informers from Sulu had monitored the arrival of a “junkong,” a motorized boat without outriggers, on Saturday night.The MNLF source, who requested anonymity for lack of authority to speak on the matter, told the Inquirer that the boat, which carried gunmen and what appeared to be hostages, landed in Talipao, Sulu.The group, the source said, was led by a Makmud Askali, who has links to the Abu Sayyaf terror group.Sahiron relative?It was unclear, the source said, if Askali was related to Haik Askali, alias “Abu Aswad,” a nephew of Abu Sayyaf leader Radulan Sahiron.Abu Aswad was arrested by police in Jolo on Dec. 25, 2013, for his role in the kidnapping of birdwatchers Elwold Horn, a Dutch national, and Lorenzo Vinciguerra, a Swiss citizen, and their Filipino guide Ivan Sarenas in 2012.Sarenas escaped, but the two Europeans remain in captivity.Habib Hashim Mudjahab, chair of the MNLF’s Islamic Command Council, said former Presidential Assistant for Mindanao Jesus Dureza had asked him to help find the hostages.Dureza is a friend of kidnap victim Ridsdel, a former executive of a mining company.“Secretary Dureza wants us to determine if the hostages were brought to Talipao by this Commander Makmud Askali. If this is true, then this Askali, as far as we know, is an Abu Sayyaf,” Mujahab said.Mudjahab said Talipao is near the area where fugitive MNLF leader Nur Misuari is hiding.“If Misuari is aware of this, he can help in the peaceful release of the hostages,” Mudjahab said.",1
"Some of Sen. Grace Poe’s close supporters are planning to field Poe’s adoptive mother, movie star Susan Roces, as an alternative presidential candidate in case the Commission on Elections (Comelec) fails to issue a decision on the disqualification cases against the senator before the Dec. 10 deadline for candidate substitution.This was, however, turned down by Poe, said lawyer George Garcia, who is representing Poe in four disqualification cases in the Comelec.“[Poe] opposed it because then she would lose her independent status because in a substitution, party membership is needed,” Garcia said in an interview.He said another suggestion was to “field Roces and Poe at the same time as a fallback in the event that [Poe] would be disqualified, but this was also turned down by the senator.”Garcia said Poe’s supporters came up with the suggestions because of the growing number of disqualification cases filed against Poe focusing on her alleged failure to meet the citizenship and residency qualifications for President.Poe, who is leading in the presidential preference surveys, is a foundling of unknown parentage who was adopted by the movie star couple, Fernando Poe Jr. and Roces, who is Jesusa Sonora in real life, triggering the filing of disqualification cases against her candidacy for high office.‘Extinguished’The Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) last week disposed of the first of these cases, which sought to nullify her 2013 election as senator on the ground that she is not a natural-born Filipino.Garcia on Friday said the SET decision throwing out the disqualification case effectively “extinguished” the election offense case filed against Poe by the same petitioner in the Comelec.READ: Poe lawyer: SET ruling ‘extinguishes’ Comelec case vs Grace",1

Even we on the outside are afraid because you don’t know which direction the bullets are coming from,” she said.The fighting began on May 23 when hundreds of terrorists from the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups rampaged through Marawi, the most important Muslim city in the mainly Catholic Philippines, waving the black flags of IS, the jihadist group that is losing ground to allied forces in Iraq and Syria.They have since withstood a relentless, US-backed bombing campaign and intense ground battles with government troops that have left large parts of Marawi resembling devastated cities in war-torn Syria and Iraq.Human shieldsOne of the keys to their survival has been the trapped civilians, who are acting as human shields in stopping the military from completely destroying the small areas controlled by the gunmen.Even so, entire streets are now just full of rubble and the military’s bombs have not always hit their targets—with one strike going astray and killing 10 soldiers on May 31.Most of the city’s 200,000 residents fled during the early stages of the fighting.Authorities say anywhere between 300 and 1,700 civilians remain trapped in the terrorist-held areas.Snippets of survivalOmalia’s family was visiting a nearby town when the clashes began but Nixon returned to check on their home and their hardware store.Since then, Nixon has been able to call her only twice and report terrifying snippets of survival.“He hasn’t eaten. He hasn’t slept. A bomb here, an explosion there. He is getting weak,” she said at the provincial government office’s entrance, from where she could see military helicopters bomb terrorist-controlled areas.Twenty-six civilians have been confirmed killed in the fighting.But local officials and aid workers believe dozens more have likely died, with their corpses rotting in the terrorist-held areas, and that conditions are growing increasingly dire as food runs out.Eating boxes“Some residents are eating (cardboard) boxes. They just dip it in water to soften the material and eat it,” provincial crisis management committee spokesperson Zia Alonto Adiong told AFP, recounting testimonies from people who escaped.“It’s heartbreaking. It’s almost unbelievable to think that people are living this way,” he said.The military has also reported that the terrorists are using some civilians as slaves, making them cook and carry munitions.One survivor who escaped on Tuesday, Christian housepainter Nick Andeleg, 26, said he and his colleagues decided to flee after coming to the realization that waiting any longer would certainly lead to death.“We thought we were the only ones left trapped. We felt it was better to try escaping. If we died outside our house, at least we tried to save ourselves,” Andeleg told AFP as he recounted watching bombs destroy houses around him.“We hid anywhere we could. We’d go under all kinds of furniture: beds, cabinets, in the toilet. We were like rats hiding under anything we could find,” he said.Angry residentsPresident Duterte has declared martial law in Mindanao to resolve the crisis quickly, but the military has missed a June 12 deadline to expel the terrorists from the city and the fighting has entered its fourth week with no timetable for the city’s liberation.The displaced residents are angry with Mr. Duterte for what has happened to them and their city.“We [voted] for him because we thought he would bring peace,” Omalia said. “Now Marawi is in ruins. He has called in the tanks and airplanes bomb the homes we have built with our own sweat. When Marcos declared martial law, we were at least left in peace.”She was referring to the iron-fist rule of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who placed the entire Philippines under martial law to combat growing communist insurgency compounded by a Moro rebellion in the country’s south.Thousands of his political opponents were killed, arrested or went missing during his nearly 20-year rule, which ended in his downfall in a popular revolt in 1986. He died in exile three years later.TormentedOmalia Baunto, who has left her six children with her in-laws outside of Marawi, said she was determined to wait for her husband.She appeared tormented by the wait though, mumbling to herself while sitting alone sometimes, and asking unanswerable questions to others at the government building.“When is this crisis going to end?” she asked. “When will this chaos be over?”",1
"The call for a revolutionary government, or “RevGov,” “is the personal opinion of [Interior Undersecretary] Epimaco Densing III and not of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG),” acting Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said in a statement on Saturday.Densing, who was the main guest of a citizens’ group calling itself Mula sa Masa Duterte Movement (MMDM) on Friday called on President Duterte to declare a revolutionary government as a way to hasten the country’s transition to a federal government.“He was speaking as honorary chairman of the MMDM, and not for the DILG,” Año said of Densing.In an interview with the Inquirer during the MMDM activity in Butuan City, Densing said: “People are allowed in the Constitution to push for a revolutionary government if they think that the existing government no longer serves their interest.”He added: “In the proposed RevGov, we want to suspend the 1987 Constitution.”Official positionBut Año clarified that the official position of the department on federalism follows the federal Constitution drafted by the Consultative Committee appointed by the President.“We are advocating for federalism through constitutional means. The 1987 Constitution has clear provisions on how a change in the system of government can be effected. We abide by these provisions and will see to it that any change in the system of government goes through constitutional processes,” Año said.He explained that the DILG’s “Federalism Roadshow” held in Caraga, Dumaguete, Baguio, Cebu, Legazpi, Davao and Tacloban seeks to inform the public about the merits of the federal system of government, not a revolutionary government.He also clarified that only duly accredited civil society organizations under the DILG’s Center for Federalism and Constitutional Reform may use the DILG’s name in its federalism advocacy activities.Año said public comments on the draft Federal Charter can be forwarded to the DILG’s Center for Federalism and Constitutional Reform at info@pederalismo.org.ph or the Pederalismo Facebook page @bayanihanfederalism.Plan for Duterte“People will push for a people’s government, they will push President Duterte to do People Power so that he would serve as President during the revolutionary period,” Densing said during the MMDM gathering attended by some 300 people wearing red shirts with the words, “Federalism Now! thru RevGov in a democratic way!”“Once he is there, he will accept the revolutionary power and the first thing he should do is sign a provisional Constitution with the Bill of Rights, then issue an executive order to organize a constitutional commission to set up the federal Constitution of the Philippines,” the interior undersecretary said.",1

"Senators welcomed on Tuesday the resignation of Tourism Secretary Wanda Tulfo-Teo but urged the Duterte administration not to “recycle” and reappoint her to another government post, as it had done to several resigned or sacked officials.Despite her resignation, Teo will still be investigated by the Office of the Ombudsman in connection with the controversial deal between the Department of Tourism and state-owned People’s Television Network Inc. to air DOT’s advertisements on a program produced by one of her brothers.“We will do a fact-finding [investigation],” Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales said on Tuesday.The investigation would be motu proprio, or initiated by the Ombudsman on its own without the need to wait for a complaint to be filed.Sen. Bam Aquino told reporters that he hoped President Rodrigo Duterte would not reappoint government officials implicated in irregularities.“Those who exited because of irregularity or poor performance should no longer be named to other positions,” Aquino said.Sen. Francis Pangilinan expressed similar hopes and “that the necessary charges against all those involved be brought to bear.”In April, the social media manager of Mr. Duterte’s presidential campaign, Jose Gabriel “Pompee” La Viña, was named tourism undersecretary after he was fired as commissioner at the Social Security System because of questionable actions.In December 2017, former Bureau of Customs chief Nicanor Faeldon was named deputy administrator of the Office of Civil Defense after he was implicated in the smuggling of illegal drugs worth P6.4-billion into the Philippines.P60-million ad dealTeo’s camp announced her resignation on Tuesday after the Commission on Audit (COA) flagged a P60-million deal between the DOT and People’s Television for the placement of advertisements in a show produced by Teo’s brother Ben Tulfo under Bitag Media Unlimited Inc. (BMUI).The show, “Kilos Pronto,” was cohosted by Teo’s brother Erwin.On Monday, BMUI offered to return the P60 million it received from the DOT.Although Teo denied any conflict of interest and prior knowledge of the deal, opposition leaders called for her resignation, citing impropriety.One-on-one meetingMr. Duterte accepted the resignation of Teo on Tuesday, a day after he met with her in Malacañang.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said Teo had submitted her resignation letter to Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea before she met the President after the Cabinet meeting on Monday night.A Palace source said the President appointed Agriculture Undersecretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat on Tuesday as the new secretary of tourism.Roque said the Palace was leaving it up to the Office of the Ombudsman to investigate to determine whether Teo had any criminal liability.Medialdea’s office is also investigating the contracts entered into by People’s Television and the DOT.The presidential spokesperson noted that the COA had not issued any notice of disallowance and had not demanded the return of the P60-million payment.Asked whether Mr. Duterte mentioned anything about BMUI’s offer to return the ad money, he said: “Well, the President is a lawyer so the P60 million is a good gesture. But under the law, it will not completely exonerate (a person ) if a law has been violated.”Sad, relief“She was sad, but there was relief on her face,” Teo’s lawyer, Ferdinand Topacio, described the secretary as she handed her resignation letter to Medialdea before the Cabinet meeting.Topacio said “she’s not clinging to her post, and she doesn’t want to harm her family and the President.”Until Monday night, Teo said she was not resigning as she still enjoyed the trust and confidence of Mr. Duterte, he said.“After a long and deliberate reflection and soul-searching,” however, she decided to leave her post, he added.Before taking over the DOT, Teo was one of the owners of Davao-based Mt. Apo Travel and Tours. Her husband, Roberto, is a former assistant city administrator of Davao City.Sen. Panfilo Lacson said he was not surprised by Teo’s decision.One common mistake of public servants, Lacson said, is the inability to distinguish right from wrong.“Worse, others do not know when to stop. That is why leadership is very important in situations that call for hard decision,” he said in a text message.Senate probeSen. Nancy Binay, chair of the Senate tourism committee, thanked Teo for her service at the DOT. She had earlier indicated her intent to look into the DOT deal with People’s Television.“It is unfortunate that her name was dragged into a controversy. I, however, commend her decision to resign and to spare the President undue pressure,” Binay said.Her statement did not indicate whether her panel would still look into the controversial advertising deal.Sen. Francis Escudero said he didn’t believe there was any need for the probe.",1
"The final question has always been the waterloo for the Philippines’ candidates to international beauty pageants like Miss Universe, Miss World (except Megan Young) and Miss International. In recent years, the Filipina candidates have performed extremely well, making it to the top 5 finalists, only to lose the title in the final question in which they all have chosen to answer in English, unlike the Latina candidates who have always answered in their native language with assistance from interpreters.On December 17, the finals for the 2013 Miss International Pageant will be held in Tokyo, Japan.

"The Supreme Court re-affirmed the legality of the enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the Philippines and the US in July this year. Is Duterte correct in saying he would jettison EDCA?Former Ambassador to Greece, Malaysia, and Singapore Alberto A. Encomienda said “yes.”Encomienda, a retired career Foreign Service Officer with LLM degrees from the University of London and Columbia University, gave a background of the MDT status today.“It’s no longer there,” he says of MDT, saying it has gone the way of the extinct dodo bird, vanished.He said the main tragedy in the present military scenario for the Philippines is that “it tries to infuse credibility to a military option by invoking the Ph-US MDT where there is not even a mutual understanding between the two parties… and the nature of the iron-clad guarantee announced by President Barack Obama’s State Visit to the Philippines in April, 2014.”“When queried by the local news media, the US Ambassador Philip Goldberg refused to clarify on Obama’s statements, casting doubts on the true intention of our superpower treaty ally,” says Encomienda.He said the US declared that the PH-USA MDT does not apply to the Spratlys archipelago inasmuch as it is not part of the Metropolitan territory of the Philippines.”He said article 4 of the MDT defines the subject of the TREATY as being “an armed attack in the Pacific Area on either of the Partners.”Encomienda has reservation with the MDT’s termination clause because “the termination clause made it appear that it will go on for as long as there are oceans in the world, what we call “an indeterminate termination clause.”Since the treaty says it will continue until it is abrogated by either side, with a one year notice, in effect “it says this treaty is valid until a regional system of collective defense has been put in place.”He said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had replaced the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), which is long dead, matagal nang patay.Since SEATO is dead, MDT is also passe, wala na rin because it’s like in any conditional agreement, if the condition does not happen, the agreement falls through.”(To be continued)",1
"We all remember when Senator Antonio Trillanes and Representative Gary Alejano travelled to The Hague in The Netherlands to personally file a complaint against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte before the International Criminal Court (ICC).The couple accused Duterte of committing “crimes against humanity” for his deadly war on drugs.Well, it seems that Trillanes is a true warrior fighting for justice and human rights. And it’s nothing partisan.Today, the Senator told The Adobo Chronicles that he will leave shortly for The Hague, this time to file a complaint against ex-President NoyNoy Aquino and his administration officials for giving the go-signal to vaccinate Filipino school children against Dengue in early 2016.The vaccine manufacturer has now aknowledged that the vaccine could cause serious Dengue disease to those who received the new drug but were not previously infected with the Dengue virus.All in all, it is estimated that some 700,000 Filipino children were vaccinated with the drug at a time when it has not yet been approved for distribution by the World Health Organization.”This is worse than Duterte’s war on drugs,” Trillanes said. “It’s tantamount to genocide. Aquino and his cohorts should be tried by the ICCC for crimes against humanity.”",0

"If popularity surveys are to be believed, Presidential candidate Mar Roxas is not very popular among the voters. He has consistently landed on the 4th spot in most of the surveys conducted since the first popularity surveys were commissioned for these Presidential Elections. He is even behind Vice President Jejomar Binay despite the latter being subject to months of negative propaganda by members of the Liberal Party to which Roxas belongs.Roxas’s supporters in social media are baffled as to why their candidate is unpopular. They think he is a decent guy and they think the ideas presented in his platform are great. But that is where the problem lies. A lot of people do not think Roxas is a decent guy and they don’t believe in his platforms or promises anymore especially since Roxas had been in various key positions during the current administration under President Benigno Simeon Aquino.In other words, Roxas was already in powerful enough positions to effect change and implement some of his ideas but he failed to do so. He could have done more considering BS Aquino made an informal promise to Roxas at the start that the latter would play an important role in his Presidency, sort of like the President’s right-hand man. This was some kind of consolation prize after Roxas agreed to put aside his Presidential ambitions to give way to a more popular BS Aquino back in 2010 and especially after losing in his Vice Presidential bid. Furthermore, both Roxas and BS Aquino have a strong family heritage in the Liberal Party stretching back to the early postwar years and, therefore, are like family. Unfortunately, the bond between the two is the reason Roxas’s bid for the Presidency is failing once again.Because Roxas cannot publicly criticize BS Aquino for his government’s failures, many see Roxas as impotent and a weakling. The voters who are tired of the current government want someone new and effective, not someone who promises to continue the same things.Why would they vote for Roxas when he could not even improve the appalling traffic situation in major Manila roads nor provide better public transport services while he was in charge of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC)? Roxas left a sorry legacy to be inherited by his unfortunate successor, current DOTC Secretary Jun Abaya. Nonetheless, Abaya went on to run with that and oversee further deterioration of the Metro Rail Transit system under his watch. Abaya’s role in mishandling of the MRT maintenance is huge according to Philstar columnist Jarius Bondoc:The other sleaze began in Aug. 2015 and was consummated in Jan. 2016. In utter secrecy Abaya negotiated a P4.25-billion three-year maintenance of MRT-3. Exposed in this column that he was rigging the talks for Korea’s Busan Transport Corp. and four unknown but supposedly highly capitalized Filipino principals, he brought the final price down to P3.88 billion. Nothing for the Filipino people to be thankful for that, because Busan easily can walk out of the deal, especially when sued for dummying. Despite its P350-billion capital, it owns only four percent of the joint venture, while the four dummies, with just a little over P1 billion combined, control 96 percent. The four – a condo constructor, an agricultural supplier, a general merchandiser, and a plumber – have no experience in railway. They are the newest fronts of Abaya’s favorite LP member Marlo dela Cruz, who before this had wangled P1.86 billion from MRT-3 without maintaining it. Vitangcol swears that Rapanut brokered Busan’s participation too.It seems all these years that Roxas, then Abaya, were in charge of the MRT, they wasted their time trying to negotiate a deal for contractors who would get paid for doing hardly any maintenance on the MRT. Abaya has been lucky so far that the MRT problems have not resulted in passenger casualties specially whenever trains stop in between stations, when the doors don’t shut while the train is moving, and that time when the train derailed and jumped off the tracks. Abaya has been lucky that the commuters who wait for hours while enduring heat, humidity and sometimes monsoon rains just to get a ride on the MRT bear with the situation because the poor souls need their jobs to be able to meet their basic necessities in life. Abaya is disgraceful for taking advantage of the public’s “patience” while Roxas’s boss BS Aquino was too disconnected from reality to fire Abaya for his negligence and Roxas for laying the foundation for the MRT debacle. All of them still think they have done a great job for the public.Similarly, why would Filipino voters vote for Roxas when his performance in his last major role as head of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) was a disgrace? His true character was unraveled during the height of super typhoon Yolanda. His arrogance was even broadcast to the international community while he was being interviewed by CNN’s foreign correspondent Andrew Stevens as mentioned in my previous article:At one point during the interview, Roxas was arguing over the treatment of dead bodies left rotting on the roads. Stevens pointed out that every day, he sees the same decomposing bodies when he passes by the same road on the way to the city. But Roxas vehemently denied they were the same bodies, stopping short of calling Stevens a liar. The DILG Secretary showed his arrogance in that instance. Suffice to say, it is evident that it would be another colossal mistake if he becomes the next President. Korina Sanchez as the next First Lady doesn’t sit well with a lot of people either, specially since she is beginning to show signs of irrational behavior. Another CNN journalist can attest to this. The way Roxas kept interrupting Stevens during the interview gave viewers the impression that he is not a people person. His attitude was like “I already know what you are getting at but let me correct you now…”. Likewise, his use of banal metaphors to describe their relief efforts can be interpreted as an attempt to distract from the real issue. At one point he said that the government only set aside pails of water not realizing they needed a swimming pool of water. As if that actually excuses the government’s lack of foresight. Stevens seems to share other international media correspondents’ observations and pointed out to Roxas the apparent lack of order in distributing relief goods. While he acknowledged what Roxas was trying to say — that the government could not handle the initial response — Stevens couldn’t help but remind Roxas that it has already been a week and yet the victims of the typhoon still beg for water from him and his crew. Stevens appeared frustrated over not getting an accurate assessment of the relief and rescue efforts from Roxas considering they were both in the disaster zone. It was as if they were both seeing the same thing – chaos, survivors begging for food and water and dead bodies lying around – except that the DILG secretary still insisted that the situation was under control.Roxas’s recent attempt at revising the accounts as the tragedy unfolded through a comic book portraying him as a “hero” is an insult to the over 6000 people who died and countless who are still unaccounted for. The survivors know the truth and Roxas and his public relations people cannot hide it by glossing over the pain the suffering the victims are still feeling now particularly since a lot of them still live temporary bunk houses.It’s not enough that Roxas is perceived as a “decent” guy by those close to him. He has to be a people person too. Since only those loyal to the Liberal Party are into him, he won’t make it to Malacanang. It’s not enough that he has grand plans for the Philippines. If you think about it, it’s only recently that Roxas has become vocal about his plans. He now says his vision is to build a high-speed train and put order to traffic. Some people can be forgiven for saying his vision will be like his comic book — they will remain on the drawing board.Yes, family and friends in the business community Roxas is a part of will likely thwart the implementation of his “vision”. They will fight for the right to get awarded with contracts to supply and manage government projects. Because Roxas has to please his “friends” in the business community, negotiations alone could take the entire six years of his term. The voters are wise not to vote for Mar Roxas.",0
"Pope Francis has had it with Filipino activist priest, Fr.

He has also set up a gaily-decorated coffin, simulating a wake and a funeral for Democracy.In the Excommunication letter sent to the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), the Pope said that what Reyes has been doing is not only tantamout to sacrilege but is also an affront to the dignified and solemn nature of funerals.“Henceforth,” the Pope said, “Mr. Reyes is banned from entering Catholic churches, presiding over the mass and other Catholic sacraments, or wearing the priestly robe when protesting in the streets of Manila.

"THE police is on track with the Duterte administration’s crackdown against illegal drugs even if it was suspended because of policemen who committed abuses, the Philippine National Police (PNP) announced on Thursday.The campaign against illegal drugs, dubbed Operation “Tokhang” (knock and plead), has achieved 70 percent of its target with over 1.2 million surrenderees since it started last year, according to PNP spokesman Dionardo Carlos.However, Tokhang was criticized by both local and international human rights groups over law enforcers committing abuses like extra judicial killings, among others. It was also criticized by members of the opposition.The campaign was suspended after policemen allegedly killed a Korean businessman inside Camp Crame in Quezon City, but was later revived by no less than President Rodrigo Duterte. The revived campaign was dubbed “Oplan Double Barrel Reloaded.”“Our intention or the objective was to continue with the program but the campaign [has] to be more transparent. Our personnel [will be] more accountable and less bloody, as what we want to achieve,” Carlos said in an interview.The PNP official is also looking forward to the involvement of other sectors that will help make the campaign transparent.Carlos said anti-drug operations have been opened to the religious sector, human rights groups, non-government organizations and other civil organizations that want to have a “first-hand” experience how the drug war is being operated.However, the Commission on Human Rights and the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines still oppose the war against drugs.“We are delivering results. We are on track with our target…we would like to achieve [a deadline] in double barrel reloaded and after June 30, we will have another assessment and look at what would be the next step forward into the program…but what we discovered is the magnitude of the problem,” said Carlos.As the President is set to mark his first year in office, Carlos said data on the war against drugs is expected to be released next week, saying it will undergo proper consolidation and will also be submitted to PNP chief Ronald de la Rosa.“This will be the one-year accomplishment of the PNP pertaining to its campaign against drugs, criminality, corruption, internal cleansing and administrative accomplishments, recruitment, logistic [and] activities,” Carlos said.",1
"The Supreme Court ruling granting bail to Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile on humanitarian grounds could benefit detained former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Senators Bong Revilla and Jinggoy Estrada, Malacañang said Saturday.Deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte, a lawyer, said the ruling was “doctrine” and it should be applied “to everyone unless the Supreme Court itself limits its application.”President Benigno Aquino III wants the ruling “clarified,” Valte said.“The President’s reflex every time a Supreme Court decision comes out is to study the text,” she said on state-run Radyo ng Bayan.Mr. Aquino wants clarification because the grant of bail on humanitarian grounds “is new,” Valte added. She described the ruling as “essentially unchartered territory.”The doctrine, as laid down by the Supreme Court through the ruling, is that bail could be granted for a petitioner on humanitarian grounds, particularly if the petitioner is elderly and ailing.“Does it mean that when [the petitioner] is released because he is elderly and sick, he cannot work, etc. There are many things that need to be clarified. At the very least, the directive of the President is to study the decision and find out what are the next steps to be taken,” she said.SC ruling not finalJustice Secretary Leila de Lima said the government could and should appeal the ruling, as its uncategorical dispositive part gave the state this window to put Enrile back in detention.De Lima said the Aug. 18 ruling was not final, as it was “subject to the 15-day rule of filing a motion for reconsideration.”“The People of the Philippines, through the Ombudsman, can and must file a motion for reconsideration,” De Lima told the Inquirer on Saturday when asked about the state’s legal recourse.“[T]he decision can only be deemed final and executory if no [motion for reconsideration] is filed within 15 days from receipt [of the ruling] or, if one is filed, upon the denial of the [motion],” she said.De Lima noted several ambiguities in the dispositive portion of the ruling, written by Associate Justice Lucas Bersamin and supported by seven other justices on the 15-member court.“Actually, I don’t understand why the [Supreme Court] decision was immediately implemented through the immediate release of [Enrile],” she said.“The decision does not say that it is immediately executory, although it says that [Enrile] should be immediately released. Given [the] lack of a categorical statement [in] the dispositive portion that it is immediately executory, the case is or ought to be subject to the 15-day rule of filing of [a motion for reconsideration] before attaining finality,” she said.Lack of guidanceCiting the dissent of Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, De Lima noted “the lack of guidance or standards in the majority ruling as to how to deal with similar petitions for bail.”In his dissent, Leonen criticized the majority decision as a special treatment for an “unbelievably more fortunate” petitioner compared with other aged and sick detainees, decided on humanitarian grounds that do not even exist in the law.Leonen said the ruling gave “no guidance to the Sandiganbayan if bail can be canceled motu proprio, or upon motion.”The decision also lacked guidance on whether the special grant of bail based on ill health “is applicable only to those of advanced age and whether that advanced age is beyond 90 to 91 years old” or only in cases involving plunder, Leonen said.Accused of graft and plunder over his alleged role in the P10-billion pork barrel scam, Enrile, 91, walked out of hospital detention on Thursday after the Supreme Court released its ruling.He posted P1.4-million bail at the Sandiganbayan and was released.On Friday, Enrile visited Revilla and Estrada at the Philippine National Police custodial center in Camp Crame to give them words of hope.Revilla and Estrada are also accused of graft and plunder for allegedly pocketing hundreds of millions of pesos in kickbacks in the pork barrel scam.

"Where is the scholarship foundation that sacked Bureau of Immigration Commissioner Al Caparros Argosino had supposedly established to atone for the death from hazing of Lex Talionis neophyte Raul Camaligan in 1991?It’s a question that Raul’s father, lawyer Gilbert Camaligan, had always wanted to ask Argosino and members of the fraternity that include President Rodrigo Duterte and Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II.“It has been 25 years, and I still have to hear a word from Argosino and other Lex Talionis members,” said Camaligan, a former dean of the College of Law at Enverga University here.“I hope that this time, he will face the full consequence of what he did. I want him convicted and sent to prison,” he added.The memory of learning about his son’s death from the newspaper and the pain of seeing his son’s bruised body flashed before Camaligan’s eyes while he was watching the TV coverage of the Senate hearing that had Argosino and his fraternity brother, Michael Robles, being grilled on the alleged P50 million they had exorted from Chinese casino operator Jack Lam.Eldest daughter, Christine, who works with the United Nations in Vienna also watched the coverage, had texted him, “Justice at last.”Raul, who had wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps as a lawyer, passed on at 22.Another chance“I have forgiven Argosino and his coaccused, and agreed to give them another chance to make good. But I realized, after 25 years, that God loves my son,” Camaligan, now 77, said.He added: “It’s better for my son to have passed away. He could have become a member of Lex Talionis and be like Argosino and Robles. I condemn the Lex Talionis; it’s not a good example for young people.”At the trial of the Camaligan case in 1991, Argosino and seven others pleaded guilty to the charge of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, a downgrade of the original homicide charge, that effectively lowered the penalty to a maximum of four years, and a minimum of two years.The guilty verdict was meted out in 1993 just as Argosino passed the bar. Upon his release from probation in 1995, Argosino petitioned the Supreme Court to allow him to take his oath and practice law. He presented as evidence of “good moral character” 15 certifications from senators, judges and members of the religious.He also told the high court, San Beda officials and Gilbert that he had established a scholarship foundation in honor of Raul.‘Not inherently bad’In allowing Argosino to take the lawyer’s oath on July 13, 1995, the high court ruled that he was “not inherently of bad moral fiber.” The court was also convinced he had exerted all efforts to atone for the death of the younger Camaligan, citing as evidence the creation of the Raul Camaligan Scholarship Foundation.“We are prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, taking judicial notice of the general tendency of youth to be rash, temerarious and uncalculating,” said the Supreme Court decision signed by Chief Justice Andres Narvasa and 13 other justices.“We stress to Mr. Argosino that the lawyer’s oath is not a mere ceremony or formality for practicing law. Every lawyer should at all times weigh his actions according to the sworn promises he makes when taking the lawyer’s oath. If all lawyers conducted themselves strictly according to the lawyer’s oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility, the administration of justice will undoubtedly be faster, fairer and easier for everyone concerned,” the court added.But the San Beda College (SBC) alumni office, which handles scholarships and study grants, has no record of a Raul Camaligan Scholarship Foundation supposedly created in 1995 with a capital of P650,000, according to Argosino’s letter to then SBC rector Fr. Bernardo Perez.The first batch of scholars was supposed to have been enrolled in schoolyear 1996-1997, per Argosino’s letter to the older Camaligan.No scholars“It’s not in our list of scholarship foundations, and we have no scholars under the Raul Camaligan Foundation,” said Joffre Alajar, executive director of the SBC alumni office. He had never heard of the foundation until Friday when the Inquirer verified it with his office, he added.San Beda has banned fraternities from its campus. Posters denouncing fraternities are posted at the office of student affairs and the office of the guidance counselor at the College of Law.One poster enjoined Bedans to protect each other, and not allow a friend or a classmate to be recruited by a fraternity. Another poster had the image of Marc Andrei Marcos and Marvin Reglos, who both died from hazing in 2012.But the case of Raul Camaligan seems to have been forgotten, without yet a proper closure. In fact, one of the convicted Lex Talionis members, Rufino Quitasol Jr., fled without serving his sentence.",1

"Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV on Tuesday said he would stay in the Senate building because of statements from Malacañang and information he received from the military that he would be arrested following the Supreme Court ruling.Trillanes said he was also advised by his fellow senators from both the minority and the majority to remain in the Senate building.He said he had a “direct engagement” with the Armed Forces of the Philippines and was told that the order to arrest him remained.The Supreme Court recognized the military’s statement that it was deferring court-martial proceedings against Trillanes until the courts could settle the controversy over the amnesty granted to the senator as a military rebel in 2011.Trillanes said, however, that the military had not categorically said whether it would arrest him.He also noted Malacañang’s statement on Tuesday that the Supreme Court ruling meant there was no more legal impediment to the enforcement of Proclamation No. 572.Earlier, Trillanes began considering going home after the ruling came down.‘Carefully worded decision’The court showed “some semblance of independence” with its “carefully worded decision” that allowed the President to save face, he said.Trillanes said the bottom line of his petition was to stop his arrest, and the government took back its order before the Supreme Court could hand down a decision.The court mooted his petition for a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order, but the effect was still the same, he added.Public commitmentTrillanes’ lawyer Rey Robles said the Supreme Court ruling made it clear that there was a public commitment by the President not to have Trillanes arrested without a court-issued warrant.“There were instances in the past that promises have been broken, things that were said were taken back. Sometimes they would say that it’s a joke, that’s why we chose not to allow Senator Trillanes to go home in the meantime. Now, it’s the Supreme Court saying there is a public commitment. If they still defy this, it means nothing is respected in our country,” Robles said.It’s not overWhile grateful for the Supreme Court decision, Trillanes said his fight was far from over.“This ordeal is not yet over by any stretch of the imagination. The Duterte administration is hell-bent on putting me away in whatever form. But nonetheless, I am very, very grateful to all those who have been with us physically here, those who spent a lot of time joining the vigil outside and those extending their prayers all over the world for my safety and the well-being of our democracy,” he said.",1
" Where are Karen Empeño and Sherlyn Cadapan?It’s a question that may never get an answer despite the conviction on Monday of retired Maj. Gen. Jovito Palparan Jr., former Lt. Col. Felipe Anotado Jr. and S/Sgt. Edgardo Osorio for the disappearance of the two University of the Philippines (UP) students.Empeño and Cadapan were abducted in the coastal town of Hagonoy, Bulacan province, on June 26, 2006, while conducting research for a school requirement.School projectErlinda Cadapan, mother of Sherlyn, said her daughter was the second of her five children whom she and husband, Asher, raised to be critical thinkers.Cadapan said her daughter attended the UP Rural High School in Los Baños and had completed two years as an athletic scholar at the UP College of Human Kinetics at Diliman, Quezon City.Sherlyn was a sports science senior student when she was abducted, Erlinda said.It was a school project that brought her and Karen to Hagonoy.Karen’s mother, Concepcion Empeño, said her daughter, a graduating sociology student, was very friendly and would always bring her friends home.When Karen and Sherlyn could no longer be found, their families sought the help of friends and government workers.Finally, they asked a local court to force the government to produce their daughters, according to lawyers of the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL), who served as the families’ counsels.“In 2007, the mothers went to court seeking relief under the then newly promulgated writ of amparo that would shield individuals from abuse of the state. The court granted protection and allowed the mothers to inspect all military [jails],” said NUPL lawyer Maria Kristina Conti.Charges filedWhen they failed to find their daughters, the Empeño and Cadapan families turned to the Department of Justice (DOJ).“In May 2011, the mothers filed criminal charges of arbitrary detention, rape, and other offenses against Palparan at the DOJ. After months of preliminary investigation, where Palparan appeared and put forward his defense that he did not take part in the students’ abduction, the DOJ resolved to file charges of kidnapping because it deemed the act as that of a rogue soldier,” Conti said.The Bulacan Regional Trial Court (RTC) issued an arrest warrant on Dec. 19, 2011.Anotado and Osorio surrendered to Judge Teodora Gonzales of the Bulacan RTC Branch 14. Their trial proceeded as scheduled.Went into hidingBut Palparan and a fourth defendant, M/Sgt. Rizal Hilario, went into hiding.In August 2014, Palparan was arrested in Santa Mesa, Manila, after more than three years in hiding.Conti said the prosecution presented three witnesses who claimed they saw the two students in Bulacan under military custody.“We have a witness, also while in military custody, who saw and talked to Palparan himself,” Conti said.Palparan and Hilario are facing separate charges of kidnapping and serious physical injuries brought by Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo, both farmers from Barangay Bohol na Mangga in San Ildefonso town, Bulacan.The brothers testified against Palparan in the Empeño-Cadapan kidnapping case.They were taken from San Ildefonso on Feb. 14, 2006, for allegedly being communist rebels.Several militiamen, among them Maximo and Michael de la Cruz, were arrested and detained for abducting the Manalo brothers.Wilfredo Ramos, another farmer from San Miguel town, testified as a major witness against Palparan.‘The Butcher’Palparan, called “The Butcher” by left-leaning groups because of the killings of activists wherever he was assigned, served on the “Oplan: Bantay Laya” counterinsurgency program of the Arroyo administration in the early 2000s.He served in the House of Representatives as a party-list lawmaker from 2004 to 2009.",1
"Who’s afraid of “The Punisher?”Definitely not the equally feisty Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales, who dismissed on Thursday as loose talk the warning of presumptive President-elect Rodrigo Duterte that he would execute corrupt public officials and dump their bodies in Manila Bay.“Those were just his wisecracks during the election period and that’s what clicked. I think people wanted to hear something different. It’s a phenomenon that he made,” she told a news conference.“He being a lawyer, I know he will observe the rule of law,” Morales said.But the usually tough-talking Morales sounded rather tame when replying to questions about Duterte who, she admitted, was related to her through her brother, Davao Regional Trial Court Judge Lucas Carpio.Lucas Carpio is the father-in-law of Duterte’s daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, who was elected as mayor of Davao City.Morales, a retired Supreme Court justice, surmised that Duterte’s controversial statements, which raised not a few eyebrows during the campaign, “attracted people who voted for him.”“But whether he would actually implement them remains to be seen,” Morales said.The country’s top graft buster also sought to assure the public that the Ombudsman would pursue its investigation on the plunder case filed by Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, a losing vice presidential candidate, against Duterte regarding his alleged hiring of “ghost” employees.Immune from suitMorales, however, said her office could only investigate and not prosecute Duterte since he would be immune from suit once he is sworn in as President on June 30.She said the Ombudsman would just forward the results of its investigation to the Congress since a sitting President may only be unseated through impeachment.“Under the law, the Ombudsman will still continue investigating an impeachable officer only for the purpose of determining whether gross or grave misconduct has been committed,” she said.Morales, who will step down from office in August 2018, also expressed confidence that Duterte would not dare dip his hands in the affairs of the antigraft body.“I think he knows that I’m impervious to influence. He will not try to interfere with my work,” she told the Inquirer.But as in the other cases involving the Duterte family, Morales said she would inhibit herself from all investigation proceedings involving the incoming President.“I think relationship is not a factor in the disposition of cases or in the investigation of cases,” she said. “[Duterte] has been very vocal about fighting corruption. I don’t see any reason why he should renege from his announced plan of running after corrupt government officials.”Morales said there was nothing wrong with Duterte’s statement that he was not keen on pursuing the prosecution of Vice President Jejomar Binay and President Aquino.“He’s not the prosecutor so he’s right,” she said. “It is the Office of the Ombudsman that initiates charges or, if it does not motu propio file charges, receives complaints and gives due course to complaints if warranted.”The Ombudsman has recommended the filing of graft charges against Binay in connection with the alleged overpriced construction of the Makati City Hall Building II when he was the mayor there.Calls have also been made for the prosecution of Mr. Aquino for plunder in the alleged misuse of congressional pork barrel funds.Morales said her office planned to pursue the case against Binay at the end of his term when his immunity from suits expires.As to whether Binay would be jailed or not, Morales said: “If the charges are bailable and he posts bail, he will not be incarcerated. But if the charges are nonbailable and the evidence is strong, whether or not he will go to jail would depend on how the Sandiganbayan, or any court for that matter, determines.”Frivolous, baselessBinay’s spokesperson Rico Quicho said in a statement on Thursday that Morales had not been fair with the Vice President.“She had ignored evidence, due process and the law to harass Vice President Binay while she turned a blind eye on the complaints against the allies and party mates of the current administration,” Quicho said in a statement.He said that in a fair and impartial venue, the cases against Binay would be dismissed “for being frivolous and baseless.”“We shall exert all legal remedies to prove the Ombudsman wrong,” Quicho said.

"Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) agents seized 2.4 kilograms of shabu worth over P12 million from a security guard in a buy bust operations they conducted, Saturday afternoon in the village of Tetuan in this city.PDEA-9 Director Lyndon P. Aspacio identified the suspect as Al-Jhmer Jakilan, 33, and a native of Isabela City, Basilan province working as security guard in this city.Aspacio said about 2.4 kilos of shabu were recovered from Jakilan, which were valued at P12.215 million, when he was arrested in a buy-bust operation conducted by joint elements of PDEA-9 and PDEA-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) last December 23 at around 1 p.m. on Estrada Drive in the village of Tetuan in this city.Aspacio itemized the items confiscated from the suspect as nine self-sealing plastic sachets and two plastic bags wrapped in a transparent cello wrap, both containing shabu and weighing more or less 2,443.8 grams; and two bundles of buy-bust money.Aspacio said cases for violation of Section 5 (Selling of Illegal Drugs) and Section 11 (Possession of Illegal Drugs), Article II of RA 9165 otherwise known as Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, will be filed against the suspect.PDEA-9 also confiscated about 100 grams of suspected shabu worth P500,000 from a notorious drug dealer from Bongao, Tawi-Tawi last Dec. 13 afternoon.Alman Aju, “Alden,” 26, was arrested about 12:20 p.m. last December 13 by PDEA-9 agents inside a fast food center fronting the Zamboanga City Hall at N.S.

"The province of Batangaswas placed under a state of calamity due to severe damage caused by typhoon Nina recently.In a special session of Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP) headed by Vice Governor Sofronio Ona Jr. on Tuesday, the province has been declared under state of calamity through resolution N-397-2016 (Declaring the Entire Province of Batangas under State of Calamity due to typhoon Nina).Governor Hermilando Mandanas had requested the SP to pass the resolution based on a partial report from the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO).PDDRMO reported that more than 12,000 individuals were displaced by the typhoon which also destoryed more than 3,000 houses.In the municipality of Tingloy, 250 houses were totally wrecked while around 1,300 were partially damaged.It was also off the coast of Tingloy where M/V Starlight Atlantic sank.Several crew members remain missing.Mayor Beverley Dimacuha has also placed Batangas City under a state of calamity.The city’s Public Information Office reported that typhoon Nina damaged public infrastructure, crops and houses.Heavy flooding left several troads not passable to vehicles, which h was compounded by uprooted trees including the two century-old trees in Plaza Mabini and near the Office of the City Veterinary and Agricultural Services.The Ambulong-Tabangao bridge was also damaged.

"The laglag bala scheme at Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) has caused the Aquino administration so much ridicule and embarrassment that the President has ordered the renaming of the airport to FEMIA.The scheme involves the alleged ‘planting’ of bullets in the bags of unsuspecting airline passengers for the purpose of extorting money.“I do not wish the Aquino name to be associated with this international scandal,” Aquino said. NAIA was named after his father who was gunned down at the Manila airport after returning from years of exile in the U.S.Just in time for next week’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Manila, to be attended by some 21 world leaders, the new signage was put up today in austere light switching ceremonies.Henceforth, NAIA will be called FEMIA: Ferdinand E.

"Yesterday, we reported that presidential sister and television host Kris Aquino admitted getting a failing grade in Filipino language during her school days in Manila.Things always seem to come in two’s.Today, the United Nations gave her brother President NoyNoy Aquino a failing grade in connection with housing relief for thousands of people made homeless by typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) nearly two years ago.Haiyan, the strongest-ever storm to make landfall in the Philippines, killed more than 6,300 people and displaced 4.1 million in 2013.“Many families remain housed in collective ‘bunkhouses’ that do not meet necessary minimum standards for the provision of basic needs and services,” Chaloka Beyani, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, said in a news conference in Manila. “I was concerned to learn that funding shortfalls and political challenges, including inadequate cooperation between national and local governments, are delaying processes towards achieving durable solutions.”Official government records obtained by Reuters showed only 2.5 percent of the targeted 21,012 permanent housing in the worst-hit Eastern Visayas region were ready as of June. The National Housing Authority reported only 542 houses were completed.About 4,900 houses are in different phases of construction. In two towns on Samar island and six towns on Leyte island, not a single house had been built 20 months after the typhoon struck.Aquino’s failing grade is in sharp contrast to the laundry list of “accomplishments” he touted during his State of the National Address earlier this week.We wonder who Aquino is going to blame for his failing grade this time around.",0
"Most of the 14 children who died after being immunized with Dengvaxia were found to have died of dengue shock syndrome, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Thursday.Duque called a news conference to announce the initial findings of a team of experts that investigated the children’s deaths.“Of the clinical charts of the 14 children who were given Dengvaxia, it was clear from their medical records that most of them died of dengue shock syndrome,” he said.Duque could not say, however, if Dengvaxia, the controversial dengue vaccine developed by French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur, was directly responsible for the children’s deaths.“We cannot answer that as of now because our experts [from Philippine General Hospital or PGH] were still studying … the clinical records,” he said.Earlier, the Department of Health (DOH) forwarded to PGH the clinical records of 14 children, aged 9 to 11, who died after being inoculated with Dengvaxia under the agency’s P3.5-billion dengue immunization program.PGH is expected to announce the results of the study in the coming weeks.The DOH halted the immunization program last Dec. 1, three days after Sanofi announced the results of new analysis that found Dengvaxia worsened symptoms in vaccinated people who had no previous exposure to the dengue virus.More than 830,000 schoolchildren had received at least one dose of the vaccine before the DOH stopped the inoculation drive.PGH findingsDuque said on Thursday that the examination conducted by the Public Attorney’s Office forensic experts on several children showed they died of dengue shock syndrome, consistent with PGH’s own findings.Dengue shock syndrome tends to affect children infected with the dengue virus, with patients suffering abdominal pain, hemorrhaging, circulatory collapse and inflamed internal organs, such as the heart, liver and kidneys.Duque said the PGH experts were still studying if the 14 children had other comorbidities, or causes of death aside from dengue shock syndrome.“As far as I remember, most of the 14 died due to dengue shock syndrome. But there were some who had other illnesses so we have to look into that,” he said.No Dengvaxia deaths“We just want to make sure that the other illnesses did not cause the demise, or if these illnesses made things worse and caused the patients to die faster,” he added.Sought for comment, Sanofi Pasteur maintained that “there has been no death established to have been causally linked to the dengue vaccine, not even among the 40,000 people involved in the clinical trials conducted across 15 countries.”“Sanofi Pasteur is always saddened to learn of the death of children and sympathizes with the families. The vision of Sanofi Pasteur is to contribute to a world in which no one suffers or dies from a vaccine preventable disease,” it said.Duque has said he is considering demanding refund of P1.4 billion in unused vaccines from Sanofi.He has also said the government might take legal action against the pharmaceutical company.The Senate and the House of Representatives investigated the controversy last month, looking into the alleged rush by the Aquino administration to buy the vaccine for the DOH’s immunization program although Dengvaxia had yet to win Food and Drug Administration approval and gain admission into the national formulary.Aquino suedLast Dec. 22, 21 schoolchildren who had been immunized with Dengvaxia filed graft charges in the Office of the Ombudsman against former President Benigno Aquino III and three members of his Cabinet, including former Health Secretary Janette Garin.Also named in the complaint were Aquino’s Budget Secretary Florencio Abad and Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa, and Sanofi executives Guillaume Leroy, Olivier Brandicourt, Ruby Dizon, Thomas Triomphe and Carlito Realuyo.The children’s complaint followed the plunder, graft and corruption and mass murder charges brought by former Iloilo Rep. Augusto Syjuco against Aquino and Garin.The mass murder charge referred to the use of Filipino schoolchildren as “human guinea pigs” for testing Dengvaxia.The women’s group Gabriela and 70 schoolchildren who had been inoculated with Dengvaxia asked the Supreme Court last Dec. 22 to order the government to deal with the health risks to which the children had been exposed.They asked the high court, among other things, to order free medical services to the children.",1

"With Sen. Grace Poe virtually shutting the door on President Aquino’s overtures for her to team up with Interior Secretary Mar Roxas for a coalition ticket next year, senators close to the front-running presidential candidate are more certain she will run as independent.In a phone interview, Sen. Serge Osmeña said of Poe: “She is just dancing the fandango, she is just going through the motion, she has already made up her mind. She will run for President.”Sen. Vicente Sotto III said he had no doubt that Poe would run for President with her close friend, Sen. Francis Escudero, as her running mate.He said the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) was to meet before the end of the month and would likely decide to support a Poe-Escudero team in the 2016 balloting.NPC members are waiting for Poe’s final decision on whether she will seek the presidency, he said. “Many of us will be supporting her. I, for one, (will support Poe),” Sotto said.Osmeña used to be one of Poe’s advisers and mentors when she ran as an independent for senator under Team P-Noy. But he said he had broken ties with Poe. “I disagreed with some of her moves,” he said. He declined to elaborate.In previous interviews, Osmeña suggested that Poe was not yet ripe to lead the country and that she was better off as Roxas’ running mate.Monday meeting with AquinoIn a text message to the Inquirer, Poe said: “We did not set another meeting but he (Aquino) said to keep the lines of communication open.”Poe said the meeting on Monday night in Malacañang lasted five hours and that she could “sense the very difficult position the President was in.”“I understand and sympathize with his predicament and situation. In the end, we both agreed to continue, in whatever capacity, striving and working for our countrymen and for the betterment of our children’s future,” she said.The President’s one-on-one meeting with Poe Monday night followed last week’s dinner with her, Roxas and Sen. Francis Escudero.Poe said Monday’s meeting with the President was “perhaps our last meeting before the Sona (State of the Nation Address) and … we both agreed that we both have the best interest of our country in mind in whatever decisions we will make in the coming days.”Aquino has said he would announce his administration’s presidential candidate after his Sona on July 27.Osmeña surveyThe Liberal Party (LP) is expected to announce Roxas as its standard-bearer after the Sona and the President will endorse Roxas a few days later.Osmeña said that based on a survey he commissioned, Poe would win even in a crowded race contrary to an analysis of House Majority Leader Neptali Gonzales II that Vice President Jejomar Binay would only lose if the administration fielded a single candidate.In his survey, Osmeña said Poe had a 37-percent share ahead of Binay’s 30 percent, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte’s 17 percent and Roxas’ 11 percent.But Osmeña cautioned that the public preferences remained fluid and could change up to the final week or days of the election as shown in the 2010 presidential election.He noted that in the September 2009 survey, then Senator Aquino had a commanding 51-percent share in the survey with his closest rival, then Sen. Manuel Villar, with 20 percent. “By February, Aquino and Villar were statistically tied at 35 percent,” Osmeña said.He said the unpredictability of the surveys was more pronounced in the race for Vice President. He said Roxas was leading the race with a 49-percent share ahead of Sen. Loren Legarda with 30 percent and Binay with 12 percent just 15 weeks before Election Day.Sotto’s doubtsSotto expressed doubt that Poe would agree to run for Vice President next year because of her commitment to support Escudero.“I doubt it because I know for a fact that Senator Escudero is running as an independent vice-presidential candidate. I don’t think she would not want to support him. I think the commitment is to support him,” Sotto told reporters in a chance interview in Malacañang during President Aquino’s signing into law the Philippine Competition Act and the Liberalized Cabotage Law.Asked if a Poe-Escudero tandem was a done deal, Sotto replied: “That I do not know. Perhaps they are seriously considering it. That I know for a fact, seriously considering it.”Sotto earlier said Poe and Escudero were likely to get the support of the NPC. On Tuesday, he said that the NPC was to meet after the Sona.“We will discuss what will be the NPC’s position on the presidential and vice-presidential elections,” Sotto said.–",1
"NEW Bureau of Customs (BoC) Commissioner Isidro Lapeña on Wednesday vowed to put a stop to the culture of corruption in the graft-ridden bureau to generate more revenues for the government.“Stop corruption and increase revenue earnings. This was the marching order I received from [President Rodrigo Duterte] when I reported to him and [he] formally informed me that I will be heading the Bureau of Customs,” Lapeña said.By stopping corruption, he explained, collection would consequently also improved.He said major changes will be implemented to regain public trust and confidence in the bureau, a hotbed of corruption, even as he assured all Customs officers and men that he would give them a chance to start with a clean slate.Lapeña announced that he would abolish the controversial Command Center (ComCen) established by former Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon, saying “it is not in the law,” and would return the “alert power” to deputy commissioners and other concerned Customs officials.ComCen is headed by Deputy Commissioner Garardo Gambala.It was created by virtue of Customs Special Order (CSO) No. 45-2016 and is the sole unit that can issue alert orders, among other powers.ComCen also acts as the coordinating facility of the Operations Group in the proper collection of duties and taxes, enforcement of tariff and Customs laws and prevention and suppression of all forms of Customs fraud and other economic frauds in all ports of entry.It supervises and monitor as well the movement of imports, exports, foreign mails and the clearance of vessels and aircraft in all ports of entry.“I am not here to pass judgment but I’m here to institute changes. I’ll start with a clean slate for everybody. I will work with the organization and I will utilize officers and personnel who are already knowledgeable and experienced in the Customs processes,” Lapeña said.He gave his assurance that those who remain steadfast in performing their duties and responsibilities with commitment, competence and integrity would be aptly rewarded but warn those who continue with their corrupt practices to stop it now.“I expect this to deter corrupt practices. We will send out a 24/7 feedback mechanism to report and facilitate actions from concerns or complaints regarding unlawful activities of Customs officials and employees and informants who provide positive information will be given rewards,” Lapeña said.“I need everyone to be onboard, everyone to be onboard with me. Either you are with me or you are against me. If you are not with me, give way or else I will take you out,” he added.“Let us start anew so we can move forward, just do your work, prove your worth and I will back you up,” Lapeña said.According to him, he would implement a “one-strike” policy to boost internal cleansing, which shall be supported by intensified counter-intelligence efforts within and outside the bureau.He said his top priority is to do away with the culture of “pasalubong [welcome gift]” and tara (grease money) and strictly enforce the “no-gift and no-take policy.”Lapena urged everyone to arrest or report unscrupulous individuals who will use his name to collect money or ask favors to circumvent laws and regulations and “you will receive a reward accordingly from me.”“I am also appealing to all stakeholders, especially the importers, to support and cooperate with us by adhering only to legitimate procedures. Part of our job is trade facilitation. Do not give us reasons to hold your shipment and I assure you that under my term as Customs commissioner, we will collect what is legally proper and correct dues. No more tara. Do not be duped into becoming instruments that contribute to breeding corruption in the bureau,” he said.Lapeña added that a bureau-wide computerization of system and processes to reduce red tape would provide a level playing field to all stakeholders and ensure trade facilitation, contributing to increased revenues.Faeldon, in his farewell speech, called on all officers and employees of the bureau to support Lapena, whom he described as a better officer than him.He was forced to submit his resignation to the President amid a controversy and public uproar over a P6.4-billion shabu shipment that slipped past the Customs zone without a hitch.At the height of a congressional probe, Surigao Rep. Ace Barbers and members of the House Committee on Dangerous Drugs called on Faeldon to step down but he refused, saying that as a soldier he treats his job as a mission, “and a soldier does not quit from his mission.”Subsequent investigations by the Senate and the House of Representatives, however, prompted Faeldon to submit his resignation, which the President eventually accepted.",1

"Whistleblower and defeated senatorial bet Sandra Cam faced controversy after several reports circulated that she allegedly cursed at the airport staff and even boasted that she would get appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte in his cabinet.According to the report of Inquirer.net, on February 16, several airport employee failed the recognize the whistleblower and asked Cam for a government ID.The NAIA employee allegedly cursed by cam, she even mentioned the name of Special Assistant to the President Bong Go and informed the staff about her future cabinet position.After several minutes, the staff apologized for disturbing Cam and the staff asked the whistleblower to sign a document and informed that she need to pay P1,120 for the use of the VIP lounge.But after that Sandra Cam fumed and demanded the staff to see the manager and questioned why she had to pay for the use of the VIP lounge.“You know, hija? I was on the phone. Do you know who I was talking to? I was talking to Bong Go. Do you know me? If you don’t, search me up on Google. I told you already I had no government ID because in three months I would be a member of the Cabinet.” Cam told the NAIA employee.Cam also allegedly seized the IDs of the lounge manager and the NAIA employee to take a picture before she thrown it on the floor.According to President Rodrigo Duterte, the cabinet position of Sandra Cam is not yet confirmed because the positions were already occupied.But if she wanted a job, President Duterte said that he’s willing to help her because she helped him during the presidential campaign.The President also said that let the public judge the behaviour that Cam showed recently.“She helped me during the election… at tutulungan ko siya .. utang na loob yan eh,” He said.The news reports about Sandra Cam caused public outrage and even the other supporters of President Duterte criticized the whistleblower for demanding a VIP treatment while the President hates that kind of treatment.nakakasuka si Sandra Cam ! — zeth22 (@zeth22_zeth221) March 11, 2017Sandra Cam’s Airport scene shows that she will abuse power given a position in gov’t!

"Actress and television host Kris Aquino has just added a new title to her name : Tell-all Queen.The younger sister of President NoyNoy Aquino is known as the ‘Queen of All Media’ and the ‘Oprah Winfrey’ of the Philippines (or so she wished).Her newest accolade came just days after she publicly revealed details of her botched romantic relationship with former child actor and now mayor of Quezon City Herbert Bautista.In a post on her blog titled “The State of My Heart,” Aquino described how after a few months of being in a relationship, a “tired” Bautista popped “the least romantic proposal a woman has ever received.” She apparently said ‘yes’ to Bautista’s marriage proposal.Aquino is known as a celebrity who can’t seem to keep her personal life in wraps. Previously, she made public what she described as her abusive relationship with a married politician, Joey Marquez, and accused him of giving her a sexually-transmitted disease.Recently, amid rumors that her president brother was ‘dating’ Miss Philippines-Universe Pia Wurtzbach, Aquino promised — during a live broadcast — that she would make for a great sister-in-law.Speaking to reporters today, Aquino said she was humbled but very appreciative of the new title given to her and promised to do her best to live up to it.",0
"Two senior officials of the government’s charity agency on Friday said they were prepared to defend the P6 million they had spent for a Christmas party with one saying that he would rather resign than work under “jueteng” whistle-blower Sandra Cam who had exposed the “very grandiose” celebration.Jose Jorge Corpuz, chair of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), said he and other top officials were ready to face any investigation of Tuesday’s Christmas party at the posh Edsa Shangri-La Hotel.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque earlier said the President was expected to look into the controversy.Personal agenda?“It was very reasonable. We can justify the expenses. We have all the receipts,” Corpuz told the Inquirer in an interview.He said Cam’s accusation had lowered the morale of PCSO employees and her attacks were “below the belt.”“I think she has personal agenda. She has been here at the PCSO for only a week and this … Our employees here now have very low morale. People think we are stealing money from the people,” Corpuz said.He said Cam didn’t know that her actions and words have been affecting employees of the PCSO.Care for PCSO“We protected and took care of the PCSO for a year,” Corpuz said. “We worked hard to increase earnings and she’s only one week, and she has ruined it.”In an interview with Radyo Inquirer on Friday, the PCSO general manager, Alexander Balutan, said he would step down if Cam were to be appointed chair of the agency.Cam as PCSO head?Balutan also defended the P6 million spent for the party, saying it was “very austere” compared to their previous Christmas celebrations.He said that long before her appointment to the PCSO board on Dec. 5, Cam had been saying that she wanted to head the agency and clean it up.“That hurt our feelings. We are building up the reputation of the PCSO. She is trying to destroy the agency before the President,” Balutan said.“I would be deeply hurt if she would be our chairman, so it would be better if I just resign,” he added.‘Grandiose’Cam described the celebration as a “very grandiose party” and refused to join it in protest.PCSO officials said they had spent P6 million, not P10 million as Cam claimed.‘Height of insensitivity’Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian said the “lavish” party was the “height of insensitivity” and showed a disconnect with the needs of the people.Gatchalian described the PCSO party as a “prime example of insensitive public officials spending public funds on exorbitant parties without regard to the plight of their poor constituents.”‘Starvation diet’Now that Malacañang will be cutting the number of foreign trips by executive officials, it should also scale back on lavish parties by state agencies, Gatchalian said after the multimillion-peso Christmas bash grabbed national attention.He said the “starvation diet” applied to foreign trips should also be slapped on lavish government parties and unnecessary expenses.“I join the President in creating a culture of accountability and prudence in managing public funds,” he added.Foreign travelsMr. Duterte has said he would cut back on the foreign travels of officials of the executive branch, except diplomats, starting Jan. 1. He said he did not want officials to be absent from their posts.While there would be fewer globetrotters from the executive, the legislative may not follow suit, according to Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III.“I’m actually encouraging my colleagues to travel so we will have an ‘internationally engaged Senate’ which is part of my vision for the Philippine Senate, and also to take some of the traveling burden off my shoulders,” Pimentel said.Like the President, Pimentel said he did not enjoy traveling out of the country, but was only forced to do so as part of his duties as the head of the Senate.“Hence, I want some of my colleagues to represent the Senate abroad,” he said.",1

"And most people thought then US presidential aspirant Donald Trump was being vulgar and sexist when he indulged in locker room talk in a private conversation with a broadcaster.On Thursday, in the public hearing of the House of Representatives committee on justice, several congressmen similarly showed their prurient side when they focused on the salacious details of the love affair between Sen. Leila de Lima and her married bodyguard and driver, Ronnie Dayan, in their investigation of the alleged drug trade inside New Bilibid Prison.In previous hearings, the committee’s witnesses, mostly convicted felons with links to drug trafficking, claimed that Dayan collected money from them allegedly to fund De Lima’s senatorial bid.Dayan, who went into hiding in August and was arrested in Ilocos Norte on Tuesday, had been described as the missing link that would allegedly tie De Lima to the drug trade in prison.But House members instead dwelled on the seven-year affair between the senator and her driver, with Dayan indulging them in his affidavit with intimate details about the relationship, including how he reportedly slapped De Lima for dumping him.Signal No. 1Both De Lima and Dayan had denied links to the drug trade, with Dayan adding that he left De Lima’s employ in 2014, shortly after receiving alleged payoffs from confessed drug lord Kerwin Espinosa.House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas set the tone for the hearing when he asked Dayan to describe how strong their love for each other was.It had weakened to “Signal No. 1,” Dayan admitted—to much laughter from the room, prompting the House committee chair Rep. Reynaldo Umali, to ask that “proper decorum” be observed.Sexually chargedBut Fariñas pursued his line of questioning and asked Dayan to describe the highest intensity of the affair.“It reached Signal No. 5,” said the senator’s former driver and partner.Deputy Majority Leader Fredenil Castro then followed it up with a line straight from telenovelas: Was his relationship with De Lima “true, pure and strong (wagas, dalisay at matatag)? ” he asked Dayan, and if it were, why would he betray her at the hearing?Because De Lima had betrayed him, Dayan replied, adding that “for the law and love of country, I can betray her.”Following his colleagues’ sexually charged questions, 1-Ang Edukasyon Rep. Salvador Belaro asked Dayan: “When did you climax … the intensity of your feelings for each other?” The crowd roared.When Dayan’s daughter, Hannah Mae, said that De Lima’s name on her phone was “TL,” which stood for “Tita Lei,” Fariñas quipped that “TL” also meant “True Love” or tulo laway (drool-worthy),” which again drew laughter from the house.Earlier, Parañaque City Rep. Gus Tambunting asked Dayan about the rumored sex video that featured him and De Lima. “It’s not true that we had a sex video, I don’t recall that we took a video,” Dayan said, admitting however upon repeated questioning that “There might be.”Later in the afternoon, Pangasinan Rep. Leopoldo Bataoil again asked about the alleged sex video, to which Dayan replied: “There is no truth to that, sir. If there’s any, it did not come from my cell phone.”DisgustThe licentious exchange drew the ire of netizens, who expressed disgust at the misogyny exhibited by the honorable members of the House.Tweeted @meggyphonic: “That’s 1M of the people’s money for this stupid circus. @DOJPH why don’t you file REAL charges and stop this telenovela?”Said @pavelvond on Twitter: “There’s nothing like a good old romance to steer the attention of a telenovela-crazed nation off the #MarcosBurial issue.”Ifugao Rep. Teddy Baguilat, a member of the House committee on women, did not attend the hearing, but when told of what transpired yesterday, he said in a text message: “Precisely that’s the reason we are not keen on Congress pursuing this investigation. (B)ecause we are not focusing on discovering of truth but on the satisfaction of our baser instincts.”",1
"The Lima Group of mostly Latin American countries should raise its pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to a “new level” when it meets this week in Mexico City, Chile’s foreign minister said in a newspaper interview published on Saturday.Roberto Ampuero, who is in the United States before attending the last Lima Group meeting planned ahead of Venezuela’s May 20 presidential vote that many countries have said they will not recognize, added that Chile may not fill its empty ambassador seat in Caracas to send a “clear” signal.“If there is a Lima Group statement … it cannot be just another statement,” Ampuero told Chilean newspaper La Tercera. “It has to be a statement of a new quality, of a new level.”Maduro is widely expected to win re-election in a vote which the mainstream opposition is boycotting as two of its most popular figures have been barred from standing, the election board and courts lean toward the government, and state giveaways to voters and a formidable party machine benefit Maduro.Ampuero’s comments come after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told a regional body this week that its members needed to do more to isolate Maduro, who the United States blames for Venezuela’s recession and hyperinflation that have caused food shortages and sent an exodus of migrants into neighboring countries.Maduro says Washington and its “lackeys” in the region are bent on toppling socialism in Venezuela via a coup in order to take control of the OPEC nation’s oil riches.Ampuero said one of the measures the bloc’s member countries could take could be stricter controls on the ability of Venezuelan officials to enter their territory, but he said the measures should not cause more suffering for the Venezuelan population.The United States and the European Union have already enacted financial sanctions on members of the Maduro administration.The Lima Group, formed last year to put pressure on Venezuela, is made up of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Santa Lucia.",1
"The dry spell in the country will worsen in the coming months, continuing the drought in many provinces and possibly triggering stronger storms, the weather bureau warned on Friday.The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) on Friday said the El Niño phenomenon, or the warming of ocean temperatures that is causing the dry spell, is expected to intensify from August to December. This will mean that most parts of the country will get less than the usual rainfall during the rainy season.More than 50 provinces that have been experiencing drought (less than 60-percent their normal rainfall) and dry spell conditions (20 to 59 percent less than usual rainfall) since the start of the year are counting on getting relief when the rainy season starts in mid-June.But in its latest bulletin dated May 27, Pagasa said relief in June and July may be short-lived. In a news conference, Pagasa announced that the weak El Niño affecting the country since early this year will intensify to moderate strength after August.Weather forecasters warned that the El Niño, a weather phenomenon characterized by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, could also cause stronger storms.The weather bureau reported 43 provinces currently experiencing drought while 17 others are experiencing a dry spell. Of these, 47 provinces may expect rains in June but 13 provinces will continue to suffer from lack of rain.The provinces that may suffer lack of rain are: Apayao, Bataan, Benguet, Bulacan, Ilocos Norte, La Union, Palawan, Pampanga, Rizal, Sarangani, South Cotabato, Tarlac and Zambales.From August to December, seven provinces will experience drought while 54 others, including Metro Manila, will experience a dry spell, the weather bureau said.The seven provinces that could experience drought are Cebu, Marinduque, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Palawan, Biliran and Leyte.“We are seeing the impact of a very dry condition from August onwards,” Pagasa climatologist Anthony Lucero said, adding that most areas in the country will have below normal rainfall.Pagasa said the country will still get “ample” rain in June, with at least one to two cyclones expected to hit the country.By July, however, rainfall will start to decrease in many parts of the country as the southwest monsoon that marks the rainy season will be confined in the northern provinces.The areas affected by decreased rainfall will widen in August and September.“In October we will feel the full impact of El Niño,” Lucero warned.The weather bureau said the El Niño will last until May next year, although it is expected to start to weaken by the start of 2016.Pagasa hydrologist Elmer Caringal said the expected rains in June and July will replenish Angat Dam back to its normal operating level of 212 meters above sea level.The dam has recently fallen below the 180-meter critical level which meant authorities have to stop releasing water to irrigate farmlands in Bulacan and Pampanga.RELATED STORIESDry spell: Calamity declared in 5 towns16 provinces told to brace for drought, dry spell in MayCebu rural farmers prep for dry spell",1
"Following the big hype leading to Sunday’s “prayer rally” instigated by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and the pathetic turnout observed over the course of this little powow, the usual question comes up: What’s next?Evidently this is something that, yet again, wasn’t carefully thought through. Then again, not much thinking is really required as input into an event that, by design, really serves no purpose other than to be an emotional crutch for a clueless and directionless Philippine Opposition. Prayer, after all, has never been a reliable indicator of the existence of results somewhere in the horizon.To begin with, what little results came out of this little circus did not even match the promises made by the CBCP of “no politics” and “just prayer”. The “prayer rally” did not look like a non-partisan event in any shape or form and, instead of delivering on its objective of fostering a community focused on “healing” the Philippines, instead, even more starkly highlighted its divisions. This was evident in all the flag waving by one or another “activist” group or another. The stain of Yellow remained despite noticeable effort to avoid the colour altogether — sort of like the way liars avoid eye contact when spoken to. Indeed, the fact that this “rally” was organised on EDSA and around the EDSA Shrine (hallowed grounds for Yellowtard die-hards) pretty much undid all efforts to paint a non-Yellow colour on this affair.The rally, instead, further widened the divide between pro-Duterte and Yellowtard partisans. By organising this spectacle, the CBCP effectively added further damage to the already fractured society that is the Philippines. In short, the fundamental issue underlying the decreasing relevance of street parliamentarianism is the presence of a medieval organisation such as the CBCP. As such, the solution is obvious: the CBCP needs to butt out of Philippine politics.It may be too much to ask of the Philippines’ evidently intellectually-bankrupt Opposition but what they really need to do to shore up their credibility and rebuild their shattered brand is to ditch their partnership with the CBCP and start to build a more coherent platform on the back of a clear and compelling vision for the Filipino people. Part of the reason that the Opposition and the Yellowtard honchos that lead it keep chasing their tails just to keep their pointed heads on top of the discourse is because of inconsistency.At the heart of the conflicted and confused thinking that the CBCP contributes to the Opposition agenda is the very nature of this organisation being a total antithesis of modern liberal democracy (a fact explored in detail in a previous article “The Philippines’ real tyrants are the Catholic Bishops, NOT its ELECTED officials”). Thus it would only be fitting for an Opposition that claims to represent the voice of “decent” Filipinos and is led by the so-called Liberal Party (LP) of the Philippines to re-evaluate its relationship with a deeply-medieval organisation such as the CBCP.It is easy to understand why such a sensibile course of action could prove to be difficult for the LP. For one thing, the CBCP and the Yellowtards go way back to the mid-1980s, back when the word of the Catholic clergy enjoyed undisputed ascendancy thanks to Filipinos at the time not knowing any better. Back then, many believed that the 1986 “revolution” would not have been successful without the firm backing of the late Jaime Cardinal Sin. Times and thinking may have changed, yet, to this day, the CBCP maintains that “divine intervention” accounted for much of the success of the EDSA “revolution”…For [Catholic Bishop’s Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) President Archbishop Socrates Villegas], the story of the EDSA People Power Revolution cannot be separated from Filipino religiosity. “You must understand that I’m a priest and because I am a priest, I have a bias. We cannot tell the story of EDSA separated from God. We cannot tell the story of EDSA separate from Filipino religiosity. We cannot tell the story of EDSA separated from Cardinal Sin. The images of Our Lady of Fatima were all over EDSA. The nuns stopped the tanks with their bare hands, and we put the flowers coming from Our Lady of La Naval into the muzzles of the guns and the tanks. This is Filipino religiosity, and you would not be able to understand the story of EDSA if you separate it from Filipino piety, Filipino religiosity, and even from the Catholic faith,” he said. He added that the youth should learn the lessons of EDSA, especially devotion for both God and country.In short, if we are to believe the CBCP, the Catholic Church and Catholic Filipinos form the single biggest bloc that accounts for the success of the EDSA “revolution”. That is certainly not in the spirit of “inclusiveness” that modern liberals espouse — specially amongst Western circles to which Filipino liberals blindly defer to for ideological validation. Perhaps in 21st Century Philippines, a bit more Filipinos know better and are better-equipped to explore alternative points of view. This highlights the damage that the toxic marriage of the Yellowtards to the CBCP does to the Opposition cause. They are preaching “democracy” under the guidance and within the embrace of a medieval oligarchy that is primitivist at its core.This is clearly an irrecocilable difference that the Opposition cannot seem to come to terms with as evident in their continued coziness with this creepy CBCP embrace. Again, the solution is obvious. Time to consider a divorce.",0
"accounted for a lion’s share of 3,551 MW of this total.Filipinos pay one of the most expensive electricity rates in Asia. CSP seemed to be one of the promising solutions to this problem. The ERC could reject a DU’s application for proposed electricity rates, as contained in a PSA, if the ERC finds out that the DU does not follow the required bidding process.The ERC’s decision to delay CSP was one of the reasons three committees of the House of Representatives called ERC’s top officials to a joint hearing last March. Most of the commissioners supported the delay, notwithstanding Salazar’s objection.A week or so ago, attention was again diverted away from the CSP issue when the same commissioners lodged an administrative complaint against Salazar before the CSC, this time, for Salazar’s alleged dishonesty, oppression and grave misconduct.The complaints against Salazar may show a semblance of an anti-corruption drive, but from what I hear, it seems to target the least sinner among the officials.I sympathize with news exec Charie Villa, sister of Jun Villa who committed suicide.

That martial law abolished Congress, rounded up thousands of people, including opposition officials and media men. They were detained for months, and many were never heard from again.

The framers of the new Constitution on 1987 saw to that when they put in so many restrictions.

"Was it a simple case of misreading an official data, or an intentional political overture against her political rivals just to score points against them?Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos on Tuesday said she thinks that it was politics that took the better of Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, whom she chided for doing the math wrongly in a recent engagement in the United Kingdom.Marcos corrected Robredo, who portrayed several provinces as among those in the Top 20 poorest provinces in her speech at the London School of Economics last Friday.Citing a so-called recent study by Ronald Mendoza, the dean of the Ateneo School of Government, Robredo said10 provinces with the highest dynastic share in the 2016 elections have consistently ranked in the Top 20 poorest provinces since 2004.These provinces, according to the Vice President, are Maguindanao, Sulu and Lanao del Sur in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao; Batangas and Rizal in Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon); Pampanga, Bulacan and Nueva Ecija in Central Luzon; and Pangasinan and Ilocos Norte in Ilocos Region.She even made the conclusion that these provinces are poor because of the existence of political dynasties.But Marcos quickly pointed out that Ilocos Norte is “definitely not among the Top 20 poorest provinces” in the Philippines, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).“She [Robredo] can easily check her data with experts, especially government agencies like the National Economic and Development Authority or the [PSA] if she wants a more accurate reading on the state of poverty in the provinces,” the governor said.“For the record, Ilocos Norte has been one of the provinces with the lowest poverty incidence estimates in the past decade and was not one among the Top 20 poorest provinces, “ Marcos added.Official PSA data shows that Ilocos Norte has 13.7 percent poverty incidence estimate in 2006, 11.1 percent in 2009, 8.4 percent in 2012 and 3.3 percent in 2015.The Ilocos Norte provincial government recently said it achieved a 16.7 percent economic growth in 2013-2014 compared to the 5.72 percent regional growth and 6.13 percent on a national level.Ilocos Norte significantly decreased its unemployment rate from 37 percent in 2010 to 4.2 percent today, it added.Marcos said the province is now one of the few provinces to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the poverty rate.Also, official records from the Ilocos Norte tourism office put at more than 1.6 million the number of local and foreign tourists who visited the province in 2015 compared to the 259,148 recorded in 2012.Marcos said Robredo already visited Ilocos Norte twice with her children in tow, “so I guess she should have observed the developments in the province and the lives of the people.”",1

"Another government official got the boot for frequent travels abroad, among other reasons.President Duterte on Wednesday ordered the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) president, Elba Cruz, to vacate her post after she was accused of questionable acts, including traveling overseas almost every month.Last week, Mr. Duterte fired Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor Chair Terry Ridon and four commissioners for going on junkets abroad and for failing to submit reports to him about its poverty alleviation programs.In a letter dated Dec. 18, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said Cruz’s term of office as a member of the DAP board of trustees had expired and that the President wanted her to step down immediately.The DAP, located in Pasig City, is the government’s premier research and training institution.Holdover“Considering that your term of office expired on June 30, 2017, and that you have been serving in the DAP in a holdover capacity, we now wish to inform you that, upon instructions of the President, your service in such holdover status is hereby discontinued effective immediately,” Medialdea said.He noted that the President appointed Cruz as a DAP board member on March 14 to serve an unexpired term that began on July 1, 2016, and ended on June 30.“To ensure uninterrupted delivery of public service, you are hereby directed to turn over all official documents, papers and properties in your possession to the proper office of the DAP,” Medialdea said.Besides frequent travels, the DAP Personnel Association (Dapper) accused Cruz of violating civil service rules and regulations, designating employees “with questionable background and civil standards,” displacing of “plantilla-based personnel,” procedural and administrative lapses, unclear leadership direction and other “various complaints from demoralized employees.”“In her eight months in office, she was on travel abroad almost every month. Her frequent travels ‘could deprive the academy of executive time for physically managing the academy,’” the group said.The DAP, through a statement from the its human resources and administration vice president, Emmanuel Silan, called the allegations “inaccurate” and “misleading.”‘Best Christmas gift’Dapper hailed Mr. Duterte’s decision to sack Cruz, saying it was its “best Christmas gift.”“Today (Wednesday) is our Christmas party and the Dappers were supposed to wear black, until we learned about the termination this morning. We are all very happy here,” Dapper president Gerald Cruz told the Inquirer.Cruz was sacked more than a week after the employees submitted to Mr. Duterte their petition and held a press conference and a candlelight ceremony.Dapper said its officers—Cruz, Earl Tongol and Francisco Gomez—were harassed by the DAP Office of the Chief Legal Counsel and DAP Human Resource Management Office in “a clear attempt to silence them.”The association said Tongol was forcibly picked up by DAP security guards from his cubicle upon instructions of Cruz’s chief legal counsel for interrogation before being served a termination letter “effective immediately without any due process.”Employees’ petition“The rest of the employees who signed the petition and participated in the activities were threatened by their managers with termination and nonrenewal of their contracts upon Cruz’s orders,” Dapper said.In its statement, the DAP said its president, Cruz, was continuing her support for the Duterte administration, adding that she was serving “under the pleasure of the President.”“[T]he academy’s programs and operations will function as they should, regardless of the political uncertainty that the institution is presently experiencing,” it said.The DAP board would announce the academy president’s replacement in the next 48 hours, according to Dapper’s Cruz.“We will seek a dialogue with the new president so irregularities like these will not happen again. We will continue our cases and probing,” he said.",1
"Astronomy enthusiasts were not the only ones patiently waiting for the supermoon to appear on Monday night. They were joined by occult practitioners, who were ready with their crystals so the Moon would recharge their healing abilities.Edward Guyano, 42, prepared all his crystals—clear quarts, aventurine, hematite, jasper, onyx and other gemstones—on Monday afternoon in time for the expected rise of the supermoon, the brightest in 68 years.He said the lunar occurrence was a good time to cast good energy for prosperity and love.The phenomenon happens when the Moon is full and is at its closest point to Earth on its elliptical, monthly orbit.About 7 p.m., Guyano laid his crystals on the flat surface outside his house in Barangay Agape, Loboc town, Bohol province, so the moonlight could cleanse his crystal stones.Brief appearanceThe weather bureau earlier said the best window to see the supermoon was between 7:21 p.m., when the Moon was closest to Earth, and 9:52 p.m., when the Moon was at its fullest.But thick clouds started to appear and hid the Moon at 8:15 p.m.Though it appeared briefly, Guyano said it was enough to cleanse and supercharge his crystals.“The energy of a full moon is perfect” for the job, Guyano said. “But the energy of the supermoon is deeper and stronger.”He said a full moon was the brightest and most potent point to release all unwanted energies from the crystals.Healing aidsGuyano uses crystal stones to heal ailments. He has a crystal for each of the seven “chakras” (the centers of the body where energy flows). The crystals can transform the energy properties of the body.This natural form of healing, according to Guyano, is often used today to relax and to relieve stress.He explained that since crystals absorbed all the energy, including negative or unwanted energy, they need to be cleansed through natural sources of water like springs or rivers, or through the moon.Guyano used to practice crystal therapy privately. But he was convinced by the manager of the Zoocolate Thrills Theme Park in Barangay Gotozon, Loboc town, to share his gift. He now has a small place in the park for healing.While he doesn’t collect payment, the park management asks for donations.Meditation timeAnother occult practitioner, Lady Diana, was meditating on her terrace in Mansansa, Tagbilaran City, during the supermoon.She was praying to the Moon for good health and prosperity.Diana also said it was the perfect time to cast healing energy for her relative in Mindanao who is sick .But nonoccult practitioners were also happy to see the brief appearance of the supermoon.Charles Pesquira, 17, a resident of Tagbilaran City, was preparing his telescope as early as 5 p.m. on Monday.To his disappointment, the heavy clouds hid the Moon and he thought he would not get another chance to see thesupermoon.But Pesquira was surprised when the Moon appeared and brightened the skies. “It would happen in 2034, so I was happy I saw it.”",1
"A Filipina child trafficker who was an accomplice and partner of an accused Australian pedophile was arrested in Cebu on Tuesday, January 24, culminating a nearly two-year manhunt against her.Liezyl Margallo, 23, was arrested by agents of the National Bureau of Investigation Region 7 on Malapascua Island, Daanbantayan in Cebu. She was tracked down with the help of Australian police.Her Australian live-in partner, 53-year-old Peter Scully, is now detained in a Cagayan de Oro City jail after his arrest in 2015 for multiple child sex violation charges, including one involving an 18-month-old infant.She has 16 standing arrest warrants for charges of human trafficking, anti-photo and video voyeurism, and child abuse.Margallo and Scully recruited young girls to appear for cybersex activities, going brutally as far as torturing them to death.The suspects produced the controversial “Destruction of Daisy” as well as other horrifying videos of sadistically exploiting young Filipina victims for money.They were running an international cyberpornography syndicate with clients mostly from the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and Germany.Margallo and Scully have 59 other cases of child sex offenses, while Margallo has 14 arrest warrants served by the NBI.Margallo was supposed to be detained in Cagayan de Oro City Jail on Friday, but due to lack of time, she was temporarily jailed at the NBI Region 10.",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte says he is open to compromise settlements of large tax evasion cases instead of fighting lengthy court battles because the country urgently needs money to build hospitals in far-flung areas.“The law allows a compromise and I will allow compromise,” he said in a speech on Friday before the Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Pasay City.He said he had yet to convince Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez and Bureau of Internal Revenue chief Caesar Dulay to agree to compromise settlements with tax evaders.He said he was not eyeing a “particular party” to reach a settlement with. “Whoever it may be, we can enter into a compromise. I’m suggesting it so I can use the money,” he added.The President said the money from tax settlements would be used to build hospitals in Basilan and Jolo, and to upgrade Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital in Manila, which specializes in maternal and newborn care.Mr. Duterte, a former government prosecutor, said tax cases took a long time to resolve in court, especially with appeals being part of the process.“It will be decided 10 years from now. I need the money now, not 10 years from now [when] I’m not around,” he said.He stressed, however, the amount of the compromise settlement must be “reasonable.” He did not elaborate.Mr. Duterte publicly broached the idea of settling tax deficiencies in the case of homegrown cigarette manufacturer Mighty Corporation. He said Mighty could pay P3 billion to settle its arrears.Dominguez, however, opposed the proposal of Mr. Duterte, who had deferred to the stand of his finance manager.“I have yet to convince them to compromise,” he said. “It is not illegal. It is not unlawful for me to suggest this because rather than, you know, if they choose to fight it in court. And it is a very slow process. I would rather that a compromise be made.”The BIR had since filed a P9.564 billion tax evasion case against Mighty and its officials.",1
"The antigraft court Sandiganbayan will put former Deputy Immigration Commissioner Michael Robles on trial for plunder after denying his plea to either dismiss the case or have it reinvestigated.In a 16-page resolution dated May 31, the court’s Sixth Division affirmed that Ombudsman prosecutors complied with the requirements for trial.Like former Deputy Immigration Commissioner Al Argosino, Robles argued that the charge sheet did not comply with the requirements of a plunder case — a “series of overt or criminal acts.”But the court said Argosino and Robles received the P50-million alleged payoff in two installments.“Each instance of receiving or collecting a sum of money constitutes a separate act,” read the court resolution penned by Associate Justice Sarah Jane T. Fernandez.Argosino and Robles would remain in detention at Camp Bagong Diwa pending their trial.",1
"Prosecutors say the hatred that inspired a California man to kill a gay University of Pennsylvania student is spelled out on the suspect’s cellphone, laptop and social media.Orange County prosecutors will begin presenting evidence against Samuel Woodward on Tuesday to persuade a judge that he should face trial on murder and hate crime allegations.Woodward has pleaded not guilty to fatally stabbing Blaze Bernstein in January after the two former high school peers met at night in a park.Bernstein was missing for nearly a week before his body was found in a shallow grave.Court documents say Woodward told police he became angry after Bernstein kissed him.A lawyer for Woodward says he has a “serious mental disorder” and struggled with his own sexual identity.",1
"Most Filipinos are “neutral” on the passage of the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) in Congress, the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey showed.The poll, conducted from June 27 to 30 among 1,200 adults nationwide, revealed that 40 percent of the respondents were undecided on the measure that seeks to create a new Bangsamoro political entity in Mindanao.Some 31 percent of those polled agreed that Congress should pass the bill that would establish a Bangsamoro region, while 28 percent disagreed. The bicameral conference committee finalized the BBL on Wednesday but renamed it Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL).“This gives a net agreement score of +3 (percent agree minus percent disagree), classified by SWS as neutral,” the polling firm said.President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to sign the bill on Monday before he delivers his third State of the Nation Address.According to the SWS, opinion on the proposed Bangsamoro region has not always been neutral.In 2012, the year the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro was signed, Filipinos tended to have a “moderately positive attitude” towards the agreement, the polling firm said.The net agreement scores ranged from +16 to +26, falling on the “moderate” category.However, the uproar that followed the killing of 44 members of the Philippine National Police Special Action Force in Maguindanao turned the moderately positive stance to moderately negative in 2015. Public opinion ranged from a neutral -8 to a poor -24.The latest survey showed that the public opposition to BBL before president Benigno Aquino 3rd ended his term had died down, with Filipinos taking a neutral stance towards the BBL, ranging from net +2 to +3.“While this is not as encouraging for advocates as was the moderately positive results through 2014, at least public opposition displayed in 2015 had died down,” the SWS said.But while Filipinos are neutral on the Bangsamoro measure, they tend to moderately agree that it will bring peace in Mindanao, the survey showed.A net agreement of +13 falls in the moderate category. However, responses differ in all areas of the country.Metro Manila was moderate both in its opinion towards the bill and its agreement that it will bring peace to Mindanao.The Balance of Luzon was also moderate (+19) in agreement that the BBL will bring peace in Mindanao, but it was neutral on whether Congress should pass the BBL or not.In the Visayas, where there is a moderately negative attitude on the passage of the BBL, the respondents become neutral (-4) on the question of whether the passage of the bill would lead to peace in Mindanao.Mindanao as a whole remains neutral on both questions, but slightly more positive on the prospects of the BBL bringing peace in the region (+7) than it was on the question of whether Congress should pass the BBL (-2).Nationwide, college educated respondents were moderately positive about the approval of BBL.Some 44 percent of agree, 25 percent of disagree, and 31 percent were undecided on the bill.Catholics and other Christians, who account for 90 percent of the sample, were neutral on having the BBL passed by Congress.Muslims, which form 7 percent of the sample, were very much in favor of the measure at +55.Iglesia Ni Cristo members, meanwhile, were moderately favorable to the bill with +27. The religious group only constitutes 3 percent of the sample.The latest SWS nationwide survey was conducted using sampling error margins of ±3 for national percentages and ±6 for regional percentages.",1
"If your favorite retail store ran out of the $119 60-inch screen TV you wanted to buy at today’s Black Friday sale, don’t despair. You can get them next Friday, December 5!The National Association of Big Box Retailers (NABBR), in an emergency meeting in San Francisco this evening, decided to hold another Black Friday sale next weekend. Retail chains like Wal-Mart, Target, K-Mart, Best Buy and Toys R Us were so overwhelmed by the success of today’s Black Friday sale that they could not pass up the opportunity to rake in more profits before the end of this fiscal year.The NABBR attributed this year’s success to media coverage of shoppers creating a mayhem as retail stores opened their doors last night and today to thousands of discount-hungry customers.This comes as an especially great news for East Bay residents who could not travel to San Francisco to do their shopping today because of a major disruption of BART train service from Oakland. BART trains were unable to cross the transbay tube because protesters practically shut down the West Oakland station. They were protesting the Ferguson Grand Jury’s decision not to indict the white police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black kid.Also, Missouri protesters Friday turned their anger over the police shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown on the St. Louis Galleria Mall, forcing the mall to shut down temporarily on the busiest shopping day of the year. There was also a protest march outside Macy’s Herald Square store in New York.The Adobo Chronicles also learned that shopping malls will be open for 24 hours starting at midnight on December 4 until 11:59 p.m. December 5. “We don’t want to be left out in all of this,” said the manager of Macy’s San Francisco on Union Square.",0
"A reluctant Puerto Princesa City Vice Mayor Luis Marcaida III was finally sworn is as city mayor following the dismissal of Mayor Lucilo Bayron.Marcaida replaced Bayron who was ordered dismissed by the Office of the Ombudsman for serious dishonesty and grave misconduct.DILG Secretary Ismael Sueno said he met with both Bayron and Marcaida and convinced them to consider the welfare of their constituents and settle their differences amicably.Marcaida took his oath before Regional Trial Court Jude Angelo Arizala.The dismissal order, according to Sueno, was served last week but Bayron initially refused to step down as mayor as Marcaida refused to take over.Bayron asked the Court of Appeals, in vain, to stop the dismissal order.Bayron’s dismissal came after he appointed his son, Karl, to a confidential position under his office during his first term in 2013.In its decision, the Ombudsman imposed against the two a penalty of permanent dismissal, forfeiture of benefits, cancellation of eligibility and perpetual disqualification from public office.Earlier, Marcaida admitted he did not want to take over Bayron’s post saying he only wanted to remain a vice mayor.Marcaida, who claimed he had nothing to do with Bayron’s dismissal, however said he was forced to follow the memorandum from the DILG since he will be facing possible legal sanction if he refuses to assume the position.",1
"Urban poor residents and health workers staged separate rallies to mark Holy Week in Manila on Tuesday, protesting the deterioration of the human rights situation and their livelihood under President Rodrigo Duterte.Hundreds of members and supporters of Alyansa ng mga Maralitang Pilipino (AMP) and the Freedom from Debt Coalition (FDC) reenacted Christ’s journey to Calvary in a march on Mendiola near Malacañang to protest against the recently approved tax law, the destruction of their shanty communities and the President’s war on drugs.Some of the protesters carried crosses to signify “immense suffering akin to that of Jesus” that they said they carried daily like the threats of demolition of their homes and the TRAIN law, or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act, that was passed in December last year.Symbolic crossesThey also cited the burdens of contractualization, lack of housing, persecution of political dissidents and activists and the fallout from the controversial Dengvaxia issue.“We consider these crosses not just of our poor but of our entire country,” said FDC secretary general Sammy Gamboa.“These are crosses created not by any divine power but by oppressive policies that skew toward and favor only the rich,” Gamboa added.He said the tax law had “unduly burdened the poor with runaway price hikes in goods and commodities.”The protesters also criticized the antidrug campaign, which they said targeted only the poor and the vulnerable while big-time drug lords went scot-free.Blinded by lust for powerActivist priest Robert Reyes said the characters responsible for the “extrajudicial killing” of Jesus Christ had real-life counterparts in the country today.He compared the President to the Pharisees and scribes who were “blinded by their own lust for power” and called for the blood of Christ.“He is closer not to Pilate but to the chief priest of the scribes because he has put to death several innocent people under his war on drugs. He has used the deaths of the innocents, of the weak, to cover up his own sins and keep his hold on power,” he said.ContractualizationAt the Department of Health, members of unions under the Alliance of Health Workers (AHW) held their “kalbaryo protest” to demand an end to contractualization in 72 public hospitals, salary increase for health workers and additional funds for government hospitals and health services.AHW said that health workers continued to endure long hours of work due to worsening understaffing in hospitals, contractualization, inadequacy of hospital budgets, low wages and violations of union rights.“Hospital services are deteriorating. Patients are overflowing … hospital workers are overworked and underpaid,” said John Paul Gubaton, Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center union vice president.“Hospital budgets for patients are depleted. Worse, hospital workers are being outsourced as a form of contractualization,” Gubaton added",1
"The 22-year-old son of Liberal Party (LP) standard-bearer Mar Roxas on Thursday went on the stump for the first time since the election campaign began over a month ago.Paolo Roxas, who shared the stage with President Benigno Aquino III and local LP candidates in Laguna, stood out with his height, good looks and well-toned physique.Except for stumbling over a few Tagalog words just like his father, the young Roxas appeared confident speaking before some 2,000 people gathered at the Garden Plaza Events Center here.He alternately referred to his father as “Dad” and “Tatay” in his speech.Paolo is Roxas’ son from a previous relationship. The presidential candidate is married to newsreader Korina Sanchez.The Yale University student is expected to be seen more often in campaign sorties with the President.“Many people are discrediting my father. There is so much black propaganda. But they only want to blot out what my Dad has done. But you know, each time they say a lie about my father, all the more that his integrity and honest service are highlighted,” Paolo said in Filipino.READ: Roxas on comic book: I didn’t approve it, but it’s accuratePaolo recounted how he once stood with his father before the tombs of President Manuel Roxas, the late Sen. Gerry Roxas, and the late congressman Dinggoy Roxas. He said his father had told him on that occasion that none of these three forebears were ever accused of corruption “and that was something to be proud of because politics is full of temptation.”The late President Roxas was Mar Roxas’ grandfather, the late senator his father, and Dinggoy, the late Capiz congressman, was his brother.Inheriting integrity“Dad said he encountered temptations in politics himself but he resisted them because giving in to them meant letting down his grandfather, his father, his brother, and me,” said Paolo.“He told me that more than the name Roxas, I will inherit from him his integrity,” the young man added.Paolo said his father’s words had an impact on him.“It explained why in his 22 years in public service, not once has he been accused of corruption,” he said.He said that being the country’s next President is a “serious” matter for his father because “it is the lives and the future of the people at stake.”“My father’s platform includes three things: freedom from hunger… freedom from fear… and having the freedom to dream,” Paolo said.Employment, protectionHe said that to be freed from hunger, his father promises employment for Filipinos, in addition to the one million jobs generated by the call center industry that Roxas helped established in the country.Paolo said to free people from fear, his father would ensure that Filipinos would have a government that they can rely on and a government that would protect them.For people to dream, Paolo said his father would ensure that there would be education and jobs for all to promote equality and give everyone a chance to have a better life.“In the story of the straight path, Mar Roxas is not the star. It is you and your families because the programs of the straight path is for every Filipino family,” he said.

"Mar Roxas has every reason to be very happy these days. The former Interior Secretary is leading by a wide margin in a new poll on the Filipinos’ top choice to be their next president.For many months now since the election campaign began, Roxas has fared very poorly in the polls, oftentimes taking the bottom slot.This new poll, which comes just about a month till election day on May 9, shows Roxas in the top spot at 37.5%, or more than 12 % ahead of second placer Vice President Jejomar Binay. Binay got 25% while Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and Senators Grace Poe and Miriam Defensor-Santiago were all tied for third place with 12.5% each.The poll was conducted jointly by ABS-CBN, GMA-7 and the Philippines Daily Inquirer. It was a single-question poll which asked likely voters: “If elections were held today, which of the five presidential candidates would you least want to win?”",0
"What amuses many about Einstein’s theory of relativity is the hypothetical Twin Paradox experiment. Imagine identical twin brothers: one stays on earth while the other rides a space ship that travels close to the speed of light. After many years the ship comes back to earth, and to everyone’s surprise, the brother who comes out from the ship appears much younger than the one who stayed on earth (talk about an anti-aging solution). This illustration has been used to show that time can run relatively faster for one person than for another depending on which “inertial frame” he resides in.We all have 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, but why is it that some people can accomplish more in their short life than others? Just look at Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Elon Musk; then compare their achievements with that of a typical Filipino. Notice too that many nations around us like Singapore, Taiwan and Korea can realize first-world status much faster than the Philippines. It is as if our country has been caught in a twin paradox experiment relative to its advancing neighbors all these 30 years of Yellow rule.1 Month under Digong: Far Better than 6 Years under NoynoyIn just roughly a month since assuming office on June 30, 2016, President Rody Duterte has brought about more positive change towards development and progress in our country than all six years of Noynoy’s damaging and destructive rule combined. Just to name a few:The halting of drug syndicate operations through a massive war on drugs The relieving of tension with various rebel groups through peace initiatives The healing of relations with China by sending peace envoys Groundwork on Charter Change towards a shift away from Manila-centric rule/developmentWe are also seeing all sorts of good news in the form of new laws being crafted and new policies about to be implemented, such as:Progress in Train System ExpansionIn particular, let’s highlight a particular case of how a roadblock to a very important project for train system expansion in Metro Manila that had been stalled for years under Noynoy’s administration was suddenly resolved under the hands of Duterte’s Midas-touch team.GMA News article: COMMON SENSE SOLUTION – Tugade: LRT-MRT common station to be built between SM North, TrinomaTransportation Secretary Arthur Tugade on Wednesday revealed the new administration’s “common sense” solution to the dispute over the location of the common station for the Light Rail Transit (LRT) and Metro Rail Transit (MRT) in Quezon City. Tugade said that instead of deciding on which mall, SM North and Trinoma, to connect the common station, they have decided to build it right between SM North and Trinoma.This extension of our train system (MM to Bulacan) had been suspended for years under Noynoy’s equally incompetent appointee (Joseph Abaya), but in just a month’s time Digong’s point person for the job (Arthur Tugade) was able to resolve the conflicts of interest that held back progress all this time.GMA News further reports:Upon questioning by Sen. Ralph Recto on where the common station would be built, Tugade said: “In between… para wala nang maglalakad na [pasahero].” “Ang importante lang na kung sana iyong nakaraan, ang stakeholders nakakasuhan at nag-aaway. [Ngayon] nagkasundo na sila na sa lugar na iyon ilalagay ang common station,” he added. Transportation Undersecretary for Rails and Toll Roads Noel Kintanar stressed that the convenience of commuters was their primary consideration in deciding where to construct the common station. “Diyan ako hanga kay Sec. Tugade. Karamihan naman kasi common sense solution,” Recto remarked during the hearing.A No-Nonsense AdministrationThe kind of management and decision-making that Duterte and his appointees exhibits reminds us of the type of wisdom King Solomon showcased when he came up with a compromise deal between two mothers arguing over a baby: cut the baby in half.At the end of the day, it all just boils down to one thing that spells the difference between the past and present administrations: Common Sense. Things move a lot faster if simple common sense is applied. Finally, Filipinos can breathe a sigh of relief that at last we will be in good hands for the next months and years to come, with the expectation of seeing progress achieved in months for what used to take years.However, with the widely known propensity of Filipinos to move 2 steps forward only to take 1 step back, will we ever learn to NOT VOTE BACK incompetent people like those from the Yellow Camp after Digong steps down? Let’s see if the Pinoy’s newfound battle cry “Never Again to Incompetence” will stand the test of time.",0
"How did 600 kilos of “shabu” (crystal meth) from China get past the Bureau of Customs if the importers did not collude with BOC insiders?This was the question of senators who were one in their disbelief that the entry into the country in May of P6.4 billion worth of shabu from China did not involve BOC officials.The senators expressed disgust on Thursday over the dismissal by the Department of Justice (DOJ) of the drug charges against several BOC officials led by former Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon.“It is unimaginable if not impossible that the drug shipment would reach its destination in Valenzuela without the participation and complicity of the BOC [officials] involved,” said Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who actively participated in the Senate blue ribbon committee inquiry into the shabu smuggling.Lacson said simple logic “will tell us that at the very least those [on] whose watch the drug shipment should be held criminally liable as well.”Automatic reviewHe said he hoped Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre would make an automatic review of the case decided upon by a DOJ panel on Wednesday.Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III said he would ask Aguirre to explain to the Senate the DOJ panel’s decision, as he noted that those charged by the DOJ were all private individuals.“How could that happen when that was 600 kilos (of shabu). It’s hard to believe that there was no cooperation from the inside,” Pimentel told reporters.Pimentel, who is a lawyer, said that in criminal cases, prosecutors usually have a theory on what happened in an incident and they would back this up with evidence in court.“So we will ask them what is their theory that the 600 kilos of shabu was able to slip past the BOC without the involvement of anyone from Customs?” said the Senate President.InsidersSen. Bam Aquino said it was clear during the Senate hearings that the shabu shipment would have not slipped past the BOC in May without the help of someone inside the BOC.“It takes two to tango,” Aquino said in a statement.Both Senators Antonio Trillanes IV and Francis Pangilinan said the DOJ decision clearly showed that allies of the administration were being exonerated, citing the case of Supt. Marvin Marcos whom the DOJ cleared for the 2016 murder of Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa.“The question now is, who is responsible for the entry of the P6-billion shabu, the security guard at Customs? Mr. Duterte, you are fooling people,” Trillanes said in a text statement.Pangilinan said the BOC should be held accountable for the smuggling of the illegal drug. But he said, “If you are an ally, you are spared.”PDEA appealSenate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) should appeal the case so that Customs officials behind the shipment would be punished.“The PDEA should be relentless in pursuing this case because this is clearly destroying the justice system in the country,” Drilon said in a statement.Sen. Richard Gordon, chair of the Senate blue ribbon committee, said he only partly agreed with the DOJ exonerating the BOC officials, noting that Milo Maestrecampo, former director of the Import Assessment Service, should be investigated further.MaestrecampoGordon told reporters that Maestrecampo was involved in the entry of the shabu shipment because he allowed shipments to be in the green lane, where no BOC inspection was needed.“Based on the hearings conducted by the Senate, the evidence shows that Maestrecampo provided aid in allowing the shipment of drugs enter in the country’s front door smoothly through the green lane,” Gordon also said in a statement.Mark TagubaThe senator said there was evidence showing Maestrecampo’s involvement with customs fixer Mark Taguba.“What about Neil Estrella? He was the one who botchedthe seizure operations—facts [showed the failure was deliberate],” Gordon said.Taguba facilitated the shabu shipment while Estrella was director of the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Services.Gordon said his committee report had recommended criminal charges to be filed against Faeldon and three of his officials for violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and the customs and tariff administration law.He urged the Ombudsman to “take cognizance” of his committee’s findings and recommendations.Pimentel told reporters that senators would soon discuss the possibility of releasing Faeldon from Senate detention for humanitarian reasons because of the Christmas and New Year holidays.Cited for contemptFaeldon has been detained in the Senate since Sept. 12 after the chamber cited him for contempt for refusing to appear at its hearings.Pimentel said the Senate would discuss the possible release of Faeldon after it shall have passed the proposed 2018 national budget and the comprehensive tax reform bill.Faeldon’s lawyer Jose Dino, in a phone-patched interview with reporters, said he had not asked the Senate to release his client.",1
"Fed up with being a punching bag of President Aquino’s allies, Vice President Jejomar Binay decided to quit and hit back at his former colleagues in the Cabinet.Rep. Abigail Binay said that it was just a matter of time that her father would resign from the Cabinet as overseer of the administration’s program on overseas Filipino workers and housing, especially with the coming deadline for filing of certificates of candidacy in October.The Makati City representative went to Malacañang to see Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa Jr. to hand in her father’s letter of “irrevocable” resignation addressed to Aquino. She was accompanied by Undersecretary Benjamin Martinez, the Vice President’s chief of staff.In a statement Monday night, Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said Ochoa “will finalize acceptance of the Vice President’s resignation.”Ochoa “gave the letter to President Aquino, following which the President called up Vice President Binay to confirm his resignation,” Coloma said. No details were given about the phone conversation.Senate President Franklin Drilon, vice chair of the ruling Liberal Party (LP), said the resignation meant that Binay could now take the role of opposition leader. “The lines are really drawn now. You have the administration and the opposition,” Drilon said in a phone interview.In a radio interview, Abigail Binay said her father’s letter to Aquino was one sentence long indicating his “irrevocable resignation” with no reason or personal affection.“He resigned on his own, he was not pressured. I don’t think there was anybody who could change my father’s mind,” she said.Cryptic repliesThe daughter was cryptic in her replies to questions about her father’s resignation. She said the Vice President would issue a statement later.When asked if there was a falling out with the President, Abigail Binay said: “I am not in the right position [to answer that] but he seems to be very tired; and in his view, this is the only way he can be liberated.”She said her father had been “holding back” from all the beatings he had been getting from the administration allies.A lengthy investigation conducted by a Senate blue ribbon subcommittee composed of administration allies alleging that Binay had illegally amassed wealth through kickbacks and shady deals when he was mayor of Makati City had substantially eroded the high popularity ratings of the Vice President as a front-runner in next year’s presidential election.On whether her father has some ill feelings toward the President, Abigail Binay said: “Bad feelings? Personally, I think it is not with President P-Noy but the terrible attacks against my brother and our family. That is what has affected him and not because he is angry or has a personal issue with P-Noy.”On whether the Vice President has ill feelings toward Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, the potential Liberal Party presidential candidate next year, Abigail Binay said, “Who is that?”Abigail Binay hinted that her father was “fed up” with the “fakery or pretension” in trying to fit in the Cabinet. The Vice President was absent from last week’s Cabinet meeting but she said this did not mean her father was not invited.A year ago, Caloocan Rep. Edgar Erice, a ruling LP stalwart, urged Binay to quit saying he could not continue being the opposition leader while enjoying the benefits of being an Aquino ally.The daughter explained her father had “programs that he wants to pursue before he steps down,” and that he felt he was still needed. “All things have the right time and right reason,” she said.She said her father originally planned to personally hand the letter to Aquino but decided at the last minute that a family member should hand in the letter because they were unsure if the President would grant him an audience.Punching bag“I want to make it clear that there are no bad feelings between the Binay family and the Aquino family,” the congresswoman said.“It was tiring for him to be getting all the punches without punching back. He was tired of being treated as a punching bag and not being able to fight back. Now, he feels liberated,” Abigail Binay said.Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. told reporters that it was high time Binay left because “he does not feel comfortable in [the] Cabinet.”Freed from his Cabinet duties, the Vice President would have more elbow room to gather “evil forces” from the regimes of Ferdinand Marcos to Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Erice said.“He will now use the administration as his punching bag and hit it to his heart’s content hoping that this might divert the corruption issue being thrown [against] him. A trapo at heart and mind, VP Binay will now see and say an all-evil description of the government that he had served for five years,” Erice said.Iloilo Rep. Jerry Treñas said Binay’s resignation did not surprise him.“In 2013, he headed UNA (United Nationalist Alliance) which fielded opposition candidates against the administration. I felt it was only a matter of time when he would resign from the Cabinet to officially and formally assume the position of head of the opposition party and be its official candidate for President,” Treñas said.Sen. Francis Escudero said he guessed Binay was “already now planning to hit and criticize the President and his government because, by resigning, he was already distancing himself from it without any real reason or provocation.”Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, Binay’s main tormentor in the Senate, said: “Finally! This is a very positive political development. Now, there is no more inconsistency in the ‘tuwid na daan’ slogan of the P-Noy administration. More importantly, it can now go all-out against Vice President Binay.”Former Sen. Panfilo Lacson said the “inevitable has happened” and that the only question was why Binay resigned only now.“He’s been pilloried and scorned for quite a long while, mostly by allies of the ruling party, if not the members of the ruling party, and he has scorned them back on some occasion. So it’s not surprising at all that he finally did what is logical and expected,” Lacson said.RELATED STORIESAquino tells Binay: You’re free to leaveWill Binay resign from Aquino Cabinet?",1
"Participation in transparency in governance will continue to promise “real change to Filipinos all over the world,” Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Secretary Benjamin Diokno said in a public forum on Tuesday.“We have further cemented our position as a global leader in governance. This is an administration that values participation in governance. We will make the government more transparent, accountable through the open government partnership platform,” the Budget chief and co-chairman of the Participatory Governance Cluster said in his speech.Around 400 participants including local and national government officials, public sector representatives and individual citizens took part in a town hall session in the first Luzon-leg Open Government and Participatory Governance Regional Dialogue in Quezon City on Tuesday morning.National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Director-General Ernesto Pernia, Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar, Interior Officer-in-Charge Eduardo Año, Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Officer-in-Charge Prospero de Vera, and Trade Undersecretary Zenaida Maglaya were among the officials who answered questions from the crowd concerning their respective units, projects and commitment plans.Among the issues taken up in the forum were preparations and projects under the federal government envisioned by the Duterte administration.“Most of our infrastructure development plans and projects will happen before the change in the Constitution. And these will not get in the way if there will be a change [since we are focusing] on regions outside Manila,” Pernia said when asked about the status of infrastructure programs.He reiterated that the government is already targeting the completion of at least half of the 75 flagship projects before President Rodrigo Duterte steps down in 2022.“We plan to strengthen the regions so that the transition to the federal form of government will be smooth and effective,” Pernia said.Año noted that the Interior department will continue to ensure that “power-hungry” officials will be removed from office if the transition will take place soon.“Our objective is [even if an official was voted by the people, if he is] corrupt, we will remove him until we have the right person who can govern,” he said.Andanar said the PCOO is already planning to construct media hubs and government satellite networks in rural areas and delegate barangay (village) information officers to help disseminate information to the masses.“We are building the first Mindanao media hub,.. and we also plan to do the same for the Visayas. Meanwhile, [we are readying] government satellite networks [that can give] satellite receivers [or cable boxes] so that people in over 42,000 barangay [village] can talk to the President,” Andanar said.According to Diokno, the forum is already on its fourth of a series of town hall sessions with citizens on key issues and their concerns about the government from their respective areas.Previous regional dialogues were also held in Bacolod City, General Santos City, and Zamboanga early this year in partnership with the Interior department and the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.",1
"Bon Appétit is an American food and entertaining magazine published monthly. It is headquartered in New York City.Today, a coalition of Filipino American organizations throughout the country announced that it will stage a week-long picket in front of the magazine’s New York office.At issue? The Filipino halo-halo, a unique and traditional snack akin to the Hawaiian shave ice.In a recent article, “Ode to Halo-Halo,” the magazine re-invented the Filipino sweet delicacy by substituting its ingredients with gummy bears.That didn’t sit well with the Pinoys (slang for Filipino), so they are staging a protest to demand that Bon Appétit recall all copies of the issue where the gummy bear halo-halo was featured.Don’t mess with the Filipinos. Especially with their halo-halo!",0
"President Aquino on Monday asked residents in provinces on the path of Typhoon “Lando” (international name: Koppu) not to be complacent and heed all warnings of flash floods.The President, who led the distribution of relief goods to 204 families evacuated at Nueva Ecija National High School here, said about 800 villages in several provinces were susceptible to runoff from northern mountain ranges accumulated during weeklong rains spawned by the typhoon.“Now, the challenge with a lot of our countrymen is that, they don’t seem to see the amount of rain it is pouring, they think it is safe already to go back to their communities but we are preventing them right now because the expectations from tonight and after tomorrow, are a lot of this rainfall that fell on the northern portion of Luzon will be coming down and will be affecting all of these barangays near the major river systems,” he told reporters here.Mr. Aquino arrived here at 4:30 p.m. accompanied by Social Welfare Secretary Corazon Soliman, Nueva Ecija Gov. Aurelio Umali and Cabanatuan City Mayor Julius Cesar Vergara.The President distributed relief packs containing instant coffee, instant noodles, canned goods, rice and blankets and kitchen wares.Mr. Aquino said government agencies were still collating data related to the damage wrought by the typhoon, noting that communication services and electricity supply have yet to be restored in many areas in northern and central Luzon.“But there are less and less areas that are somewhat isolated. Cabanatuan, in fact, was part of the list of those isolated, that’s why we are here,” he said.“The challenge here is that you have a lingering typhoon as opposed to just crossing our landmass in a matter of a few hours. The expectations for the effects of this particular typhoon are about three days long,” he added.Mr. Aquino assured that personnel of various electric cooperatives in typhoon-hit areas are checking their transmission lines to ensure that these are safe by the time these are reenergized.He said the typhoon had not left the Luzon landmass and had veered northeast, threatening provinces in the Ilocos and Cordillera regions.“That’s what we are trying to gear up for. And of course, we want to prevent any spread of a disease, leptospirosis is considered a threat especially the way through the floodwaters,” he said.“Again, we will not take any chance and we will try to ensure that we are on the side of being conservative and making sure that everybody is protected during this time,” the President said.",1
"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray faced sharp questioning from lawmakers Thursday about the Justice Department’s independence, with Republicans accusing law enforcement of withholding important documents and demanding details about surveillance tactics during the Russia investigation.Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee contend the department has conspired against President Donald Trump and refused to turn over documents they believe would show improper conduct by the FBI. They have seized on an inspector general report this month that revealed derogatory text messages about Trump exchanged by FBI officials who were part of the investigation into his presidential campaign.The hearing comes as the House prepares to vote on a resolution that demands the department turn over thousands of documents by July 6 on FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton’s private email use and Trump campaign ties to Russia.The House Judiciary Committee approved the resolution in a contentious hearing Tuesday. On Wednesday, the panel privately interviewed an FBI agent involved in both investigations who had sent anti-Trump texts.Wray and Rosenstein said law enforcement officials have been working diligently to turn over the requested records.Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee, signaled the tone of the hearing in his opening remarks when he complained about the FBI and the Justice Department not producing all of the documents that have been requested.“The Department of Justice and the FBI are not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. The President and Congress are,” Goodlatte said. “Our Constitutional oversight necessitates that institutions like the FBI and DOJ yield to Congress’ constitutional mandate.”Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis of Florida demanded to know why Rosenstein had not recused from oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether the president had committed obstruction of justice given Rosenstein’s role in laying the groundwork for the firing of FBI Director James Comey.“I can assure you that if it were appropriate for me to recuse, I’d be more than happy to do so,” Rosenstein said.",1
"Former Special Assistant to the President Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go urged the youth to avoid illegal drugs, saying drug use ruins lives and families.He lauded members of Kabataan Kontra Droga at Terorismo (KKDAT) for their active participation in nation-building.“Ang programang KKDAT ang magbibigay daan na mas mapakinggan ang boses ninyo upang mas epektibong matugunan natin ang mga problemang kasalukuyang hinaharap ng bansa. Sa totoo lang, napahanga niyo ako dahil sa kagustuhan niyong maging bahagi ng laban para sa pagbabago (The KKDAT program will allow you to be heard and will enable officials to better address the problems faced by the nation. Your desire to institute change is commendable),” Go said when he graced the KKDAT program in Davao City on Saturday.KKDAT is a program where young Filipinos engage in dialogues that help them gain more understanding about the effects of terrorism, violent extremism, and the abuse of illegal substance.Upon arrival in Manila on the same day, Go also reminded members of the Tricycle Operators and Drivers Association (TODA) in Navotas to stay away from illegal drugs.“Isipin ninyo, ‘yung pinagpaguran ninyo sa buong araw, masasayang lang at mapupunta sa wala sa paggamit ninyo ng droga. Sayang lang. Wala pang magandang naidudulot ‘yan,” Go said when he visited fire victims in Tangos North, Navotas.A TODA member approached Go and thanked him and President Rodrigo Duterte for their help. He admitted that he used to be a drug addict but he changed because of Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs.Go said Filipinos should stay away from illegal drugs because it could tear families apart.“Nakakasira ng utak, nakakasira pa ng buhay ng pamilya (It can mess with your head, and ruin your family),” he warned.After his visit to Navotas, Go attended the Libreng Concert Para sa Kabataan ng Mandaluyong at the Rizal Techonological University. In his speech, he also encouraged the youth to focus on sports instead of illegal drugs.“Isa po ito sa aking adbokasiya – itong sports lalong-lalo na po ang basketball, in support of the President’s campaign laban sa droga, corruption at kriminalidad… isang paraan ang sports para malayo ang kabataan sa masamang bisyo (This is one of my advocacies, sports, especially basketball, in support of the President’s campaign against drugs, corruption and criminality. This is one way of keeping the youth away from drugs),” Go said.The former Palace official earlier said that if he wins in his Senate bid, he would review existing legislative measures with the aim of strengthening the fight against the illegal drug trade.This includes the possibility of amending the controversial Juvenile Justice Act, which the President has repeatedly said is being abused by drug syndicates to recruit minors into their ranks.",1
"The government’s conditional cash transfer (CCT) program should be reviewed to avoid misuse and for potential inclusion of a livelihood component, the new head of the National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) said on Wednesday.Liza Maza, former Gabriela representative and recently appointed NAPC lead convenor, said that while she had been vocal against the CCT program, she was “constrained” by the pronouncement of President Duterte that the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) should be continued.“We have to work within the space given to us. The NAPC could join the review and make recommendations on how to improve 4Ps,” Maza said during an interview with Inquirer editors and reporters.Maza said one of the things that should be refined was how to safeguard the funds against patronage politics.“It’s high time that we look into the impact of 4Ps. Does it really alleviate poverty? There are studies saying it doesn’t. There are many issues even in the implementation. There are cases wherein those who are really poor are not included because of politics,” Maza said.The CCT program under the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) was started under the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and continued by President Benigno Aquino III.The program provides a monthly stipend to poor families for the health and education of children up to 18 years old.“Relying on subsistence or dole out will never be enough [to alleviate poverty],” Maza said.A livelihood component could be developed and integrated in the program so that the beneficiaries will have sustainable income, she said, adding that she hoped the NAPC will have enough budget for prototyping or program modeling.“This is what I’m really excited about. If NAPC will have the chance to model what can be done, there is possibility of strengthening agriculture, our own industry and manufacturing,” she said.For example, a piece of land can be planted to coconuts and instead of just producing copra, a factory can be set up to manufacture virgin coconut oil or packaged coconut water.“We will be able to produce higher value for the work of our farmers,” Maza said.NAPC has a mandate for policy recommendation and oversight. It serves as platform for different sectors to engage the government and voice out their needs.The contention with 4Ps is on how resources are being allocated, Maza said. “Are you going to put it in 4Ps or are you going to put it in educational reforms so that education is free?” she said when told about thousands who have graduated from high school through the help of the program.“It’s not whether the program is successful because it produced graduates. It’s about you have P60 billion which could have been used to build 10 factories,” Maza said.",1
"Free rides on government buses and 6×6 trucks will be available to the public today, Monday, according to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in response to a strike by public utility vehicles (PUVs).Meanwhile, rides on private buses can be availed by passengers of on a minimal fare.The STOP & GO Transport Coalition earlier announced a “Tigil-Pasada” on February 6 in protest against a proposed phaseout of jeepneys and other public utility vehicles of PUVs, among other isues.The No to Jeepney Phase Out Coalition and PISTON transport groups have expressed their support to the mass action but clarified that they will not be able to join because they will be holding an organizational meeting.The two transport groups also made an invitation to STOP & GO head Jun Magno to organize a wider protest and possible Tigil-Pasada on another date, according to George San Mateo, president of PISTON.San Mateo said Magno accepted his invitation.The LTFRB said 4,800 military and police officers and non-uniformed officers and employees of the LTFRB, Department of Transportation, Philippine Coast Guard, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Department of Public Works and Highways and Office for Transportation Security will be deployed to ensure public safety.It reminded PUV operators that the no-strike policy is still in effect in accordance with Memorandum Circular 2011-004.“The PUV operator shall not resort to cessation of service as a sign or demonstration of protest vs any government decision or action under pain of suspension or cancellation of the authority to operate granted by the board nor shall the PUV operator tolerate, allow or authorize personnel to join others committing acts prejudicial to the riding public, including but not limited to, paralyzing transport services by intimidation, coercion or violence,” as stated in the memorandum circular.Applicable penalties shall be imposed by the board for failure of PUV operators to comply, the LTFRB warned.The Quezon City Police District (QCPD) is bracing itself for today’s suspension of PUV operations, meeting with MMDA, Land Transportation Office-National Capital Region (Metro Manila), Traffic Management Group-NCR, Quezon City Department of Public Order and Safety, PISTON STOP & GO and other concerned offices and groups.The preparation also includes deployment of sufficient numbers of policemen to different areas where operators and drivers will stage their protests to ensure peace and order.“They will be deployed as early as 5 a.m. on Monday to at least 16 convergent points in Quezon City to monitor the situation, especially stranded passengers. These areas include Muñoz, Balintawak, Commonwealth-Litex, Commonwealth-IBP Road, Philcoa, Quezon Avenue-Centris, Welcome Rotunda, Tandang Sora-Commonwealth, Quirino Highway-Zabarte Road, Santolan-Crame, Aurora Boulevard-Annapolis and Timog-Tomas Morato,” Chief Supt. Guillermo Eleazar, QCPD director, said over the weekend.WITH ",1
"A political strategist named Ma. Lourdes Tiquia of Manila Times wrote an article about her takes on President Rodrigo Duterte's accomplishments on the world stage.Read her full article below:""Who would have thought that a mayor could pull out a homer in dealing with Asian behemoths like China and Japan? Lacking national exposure, he brandished his sword and laid claim to a record never before seen in presidential history in the Philippines: 6th Asian nations in 117 days in office.AdvertisementDerisively called mad man by his critics, there is serious thinking in his “madness.” Visiting Laos, Indonesia, Vietnam, Brunei, China and Japan, PRRD has set the stage for a peaceful region, lights on for Asia and ASEAN and a face-to-face diplomacy that has never been seen from a David like the Philippines. There is rhyme and reason where he went and the key messages he called out in those visits. The Duterte Initiative has made the Philippines top of mind. Apart from Manny Pacquiao, foreigners meeting Filipinos have been asking about Duterte. Seriously, the “mad man” is a rockstar.The call outs have been consistent: economic, illegal drugs, security in bilateral talks. Laos was Bud Dajo and getting the attention of the US (and Duterte got it big time). Indonesia (biggest Muslim country in ASEAN) was about illegal drugs trade, Mary Jane Veloso, AEC and comparing leadership notes (Widodo was Jakarta mayor before becoming president). Vietnam was “economic bilateral cooperation, including stronger partnership in economic, agriculture, defense and maritime cooperation, and war against illegal drugs.” Brunei was “trade and investments and developing our halal sector and micro, small and medium enterprises, support for the government’s anti-narcotics campaign” and the re-engineering of BIMP-EAGA. China is trade and security as well as exploring peace within the framework of the decision of the International Court. Japan is rebalancing in the region, among others.There are four essential elements of a state: population, territory, government and sovereignty. The first two constitute the physical and material basis of a state and the last two, its political and spiritual basis. Of late, international recognition has been added. This is the recognition of the sovereign status of a new state by other states. Recognition has political dimensions in the community of nations. Recognition becomes the magnet that can attract investors and foreign direct investments. Recognition is also a reward for pursuing domestic policies that reform age old issues such as crime, corruption and inefficiencies in the system.It is interesting to note that what appeared to be a faux pas on schedules of presidential foreign trips turned out to be a defining moment for the country as she grapples reframing foreign policy and rebalancing powers and influences in the region. PRRD was after all supposed to go first to Japan then to China. Critics were up in arms in the sudden change saying “a president does not mess up foreign schedules, just like that.” The sudden change can now be understood in the light of the declaration by PRRD, “Japan is and will always be a true friend.” A rare display from the bad mouth leader.In the arrival speech by the president, he now tells the public why and what transpired said visit. This arrival speech was far different in tone and delivery. The words were carefully chosen for the important rebalancing strategy. Characterized as a “defining moment” in our ties, the president talked about common paths and shared objectives. He mentioned “maritime security and maritime domain awareness” as key priorities. Duterte explained that Japan will play an important role in maritime interests that need to be protected against “piracy, criminality at sea, terrorism and responding to disasters.” He likewise talked of shared objectives: democracy, adherence to the rule of law and peaceful settlement of disputes.”Clearly, the Philippines is not pivoting to anyone. It is rebalancing the region in what appears to be Japan being the fulcrum. With Duterte’s deft move, Japan is now the countervailing force to China in the region. It has been 44 years since 29 September 1972 that China and Japan normalized diplomatic relations, two countries that spent much of the 20th century in mutual enmity if not at outright war. The anniversary comes at a low point in Sino-Japanese relations amid a dispute over an island chain in the East China Sea known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and Diaoyu Islands in China. This was the other backdrop in play during the visit of PRRD to Japan. The Philippines, with its arbitral award, teaches Japan how to flex its muscles without wringing necks and that is the audacity of Digong, the trump card was never played and we got win-win in China and Japan.SponsorFrom the China visit where we had the red carpet rolled out and a welcome ceremony unparalleled to none, “China has committed a total of USD 24billion to the Philippines. USD 15billion are in economic deals and USD 9billion in soft loans. To Japan who has committed to the Philippines USD 2billionin economic deals and USD 48million in soft loans.Duterte finally made it known to all that an independent foreign policy should be “consistent with the Constitution, protective of national interests and beneficial to the people.” Clearly, Duterte has chosen to articulate in the visit to Japan what to his view is good for the country. PH-Japan relationship is “best viewed as exemplary partnership that can only gain strength in the years to come.” Notice the contrast with the US.The Duterte Initiative will close out in the remaining days of the year with visits to Malaysia and Russia. And after these visits, one can put together clearly the Duterte Initiative. Clearly, that is purely Asia in orientation.Interestingly, in a 1951 commencement speech at the University of the Philippines, then Senator Claro M. Recto said: “sentimentalism and emotionalism should not play a part in international relations. It is folly to expect any nation to ever sacrifice its welfare and security to pure idealism or to sentimental attachments. As Filipinos, we must look out for ourselves, because no one else will. That is the essence of our independence.”Recto further pointed out, “but as long as we are an independent Republic, we can and should act as a free people and as Filipinos. As Filipinos we must profess and declare that the security of our nation is paramount, and as a free people we must profess and declare that, while the liberties of other peoples are important to us in this world of interdependence, our first duty is to our own.”The Duterte Initiative has echoed this historical line: “the first objective of our government must be peace, for, as a small and weak nation, it is to our prime interest to explore with patience and sincerity every avenue of honorable and enduring settlement by negotiation and mutual concessions. If war must come, it must not be of our own making, either directly or indirectly.”And the Duterte Initiative has rang the bells, as Recto did in 1951, “let us awake from the daydreams of adolescence, and cease to imagine ourselves as saviors of a world in distress, riding on our fanciful adventures for which we have neither heart nor strength, while we neglect the care of our own concerns. We have no manifest destiny to fulfill, no historical missions to carry out in the age of superpowers. Our aims are simple and well defined: to preserve the integrity of our national territory, to safeguard the independence and liberties of our people, and to promote their welfare by the enforcement of our rights and the fulfillment of our obligations. It is on this irreducible basis of national interest that we should build our foreign relations.”In fine, I shall return has never been truly laden with good intentions.""Source: Manila Times ",0
"Twenty-year-old Gabby Douglas didn’t put her hand over her heart when The Star-spangled Banner was played in Rio. She was the only one who didn’t — among the five women gymnasts who won back-to-back gold for the United States.Soon after that medal ceremony, many Americans took to social media to criticize Douglas, saying what she did was disrespectful and unpatriotic.Today, The Adobo Chronicles released an online survey conducted among all those who criticized Douglas on Twitter and Facebook. We were shocked at what we found out:One out of three of those surveyed didn’t know that the title of the U.S. National Anthem was ‘The Star-spangled Banner.’ Two out of three could not sing the U.S. National Anthem, with the correct lyrics. Three out of three could not reach the highest note in the anthem. One out of three place their hand over their lungs, not heart, when singing the anthem. One out of three flash the “peace” sign with their fingers when reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.All the respondents were also shocked to see photos of President Barack Obama and their favorite football players not placing their hand over their heart during the singing of the anthem.To obtain a copy of the survey, please email NBC Sports or FOX News.",0

"PRESIDENT BENIGNO AQUINO III’S 2015 STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESSBATASANG PAMBANSA COMPLEX, QUEZON CITYJULY 27, 2015(English translation)Thank you, everyone. Please sit down.Before I begin, I would first like to apologize. I wasn’t able to do the traditional processional walk, or shake the hands of those who were going to receive me, as I am not feeling too well right now.Vice President Jejomar Binay; Former Presidents Fidel Valdez Ramos and Joseph Ejercito Estrada; Senate President Franklin Drilon and members of the Senate; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. and members of the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno and our Justices of the Supreme Court; distinguished members of the diplomatic corps; members of the Cabinet; local government officials; members of the military, police, and other uniformed services; my fellow public servants; and, to my Bosses, my beloved countrymen: Good afternoon to you all.This is my sixth SONA. Once again, I face Congress and our countrymen to report on the state of our nation. More than five years have passed since we put a stop to the culture of “wang-wang,” not only in our streets, but in society at large; since we formally took an oath to fight corruption to eradicate poverty; and since the Filipino people, our bosses, learned how to hope once more. My bosses, this is the story of our journey along the Straight Path.Just last Friday, we inaugurated the Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway. This is the first Public-Private Partnership project that we approved, and the first such PPP project opened to the public under our administration. Under the previous administrations: It was as if the government had to beg the private sector just to gain their participation. Now, companies are the ones seemingly courting the government—for MCX in particular, we were paid a premium of P925 million just so that our private partner could have the privilege of building the infrastructure we need. In fact, they are so confident that this project will earn them a profit, that they said the first month of toll operations at MCX is free.We have indeed come so far. And, in order for us to appreciate just how far we have travelled, let us recall where we started.When we came into office, we found a citizenry that had grown desensitized to the many allegations of lying, cheating, and stealing in government.Those in power boasted of the country having enough classrooms. In truth: classes had to be held in four shifts. Students went to school while it was still dark, and others would go home long after the dark of night had well and truly fallen. All of them were left in the dark because they were not accorded sufficient time in the classroom for learning.Our predecessor took pride in “uninterrupted growth” during her last SONA. Scrutinize what she said, however, and you would realize that a significant portion of this growth was fueled by remittances from Filipinos who had lost hope in our country. As they say: People were voting with their feet. If I were to imitate that style of governance, I would be loath to claim a success borne of forcing my countrymen to escape our shores.As the 2004 elections approached, more than P700 million were allegedly used to buy fertilizer that was not suitable for crops; the endeavor was costly; and in many instances, the farmers who should have received the farming supplements never saw it. We ask: Who was nourished by such fertilizers? Definitely neither the farmers nor their crops. Perhaps you also remember the NBN-ZTE scandal. We investigated this in the Senate; someone said there was an attempt to bribe him. When we undertook an inquiry, this person did not want to testify; he claimed executive privilege. Of course, we couldn’t summon the sitting President—hence, the only one we could question was her henchman accused of bribery. Naturally, he denied the accusation.During those times, even children became familiar with the word “scam.” You might also remember “Hello Garci,” to which the answer was a mere “I am sorry.” The genuine bank accounts of the nonexistent Jose Pidal. The attempt to convene a Constitutional Assembly, so that they could stay in power for the rest of their lives. There was Executive Order 464, which tried to stifle the truth. The declaration of a State of Emergency, in order to do away with the checks and balances for Martial Law as enshrined in the 1987 Constitution. There were midnight appointments. The policy known as Calibrated Preemptive Response, which was used against protesters. Even on the level of grammar, this is wrong. How could a response come before anything else? It’s like saying you replied to someone who never texted you.These were the headlines that greeted us every time we had breakfast in the years before we came into office. The moment we assumed the presidency, we began to unearth anomaly after anomaly. In my previous SONAs, I have already mentioned some of them: In the National Food Authority, they allowed the debt to bloat from P12.3 billion pesos in 2001, to P176.8 billion in June 2010. Even worse: they continued to import rice, only to have it rot in warehouses. In PAGCOR, a billion pesos went to coffee. In the MWSS: excessive bonuses, one on top of the other. For the Laguna Lake: an attempt to waste over P18 billion just to play with mud. Indeed: I could not comprehend how those behind such controversies could willingly benefit from the suffering of our countrymen.Every government official takes an oath to do right by our countrymen and to uphold the law. But it was clear: our predecessor did precisely the opposite. We were all witnesses to the most appalling example, when 58 Filipinos were massacred in Maguindanao in November 2009. To think about committing such a crime was already heinous. To do it, which they did, was even worse. The worst offense of all: Their belief that they could get away with it, because they were in power—which is why they carried out their plans in the first place. These are only a few examples; there are many others.With this kind of situation, can we really blame our countrymen for losing sight of hope, and consequently, leaving our country?Like you, the thought of giving up had crossed my mind. When my mother died, my confidence diminished further; our family’s leader and inspiration to pursue change was gone. At her wake, someone approached me and suggested that I run for the presidency. My immediate response: I am not a masochist. I was one of the people calling for an end to impunity and wrongdoing; I understood just how dire the situation was. I was also certain they had deliberately hidden details from us, and the real problems were bigger than what we knew. When you called me to serve, my question was: If I am unable to solve these problems quickly, how long will it take before my bosses lose their patience, and instead direct all their anger at me?One of those who convinced me to run was Alex Lacson. He said: “To simply put an end to all the abuse would suffice. To stop the hemorrhaging would be enough.”Let us listen to him:Translated transcript of Testimonial of Alex LacsonIn 2008, our country was ranked by the World Bank as one of the most corrupt in the world. Our self-confidence and morale as a people were very low.At the time, many of my friends and I were looking for a good man, not just a good politician to be our president in 2010.Then, President Cory passed away, and Senator Noynoy spoke at her funeral. That is when we truly saw him.My friends encouraged me to lead the public call to urge Senator Noynoy to run for president. My friends and I went to the house of Senator Noynoy in Times Street. We brought a yellow drum and we encouraged the public to write letters.Within 24 hours there was an outpouring of public support for Senator Noynoy to run for public office.I did not expect him to be superman and solve all our problems in the country; we expected him only to begin reform.Mr. President, thank you for heeding the call of the people in 2010, and thank you, too, for respecting my beliefs, even as we disagreed on a number of issues.Mr. President, continue to lead our country on the right path.From the start, we already knew that corruption was the root of all our people’s suffering. Thus, our battle cry: where there is no corruption, there will be no poverty.Tremendous perseverance, courage, political will, and faith in God and in our fellowmen were needed in order to breathe life into this ideal. Of course, the masterminds of the old system were not meek lambs, willing to see the end of their opportunity to take advantage of others. They used, and continue to use, their influence and wealth to fight our agenda of change. They also used their power to prepare life preservers for when the time of judgment came.The Ombudsman who should have been appointed to guard against corruption allegedly played blind to all the scandals of the past administration. She was impeached in the House of Representatives, and resigned from her post before she could be tried in the Senate. The Chief Justice who seemed to have a bias for the one who appointed him, was proven to have hidden wealth and properties not disclosed in his SALN. He was impeached in the House and convicted in the Senate.To replace them, we appointed men and women with integrity and independent minds. The new Ombudsman: Conchita Carpio-Morales. The new Chief Justice: Ma. Lourdes Sereno. Now, she has sufficient time to implement reform in the Judiciary.Even in other agencies, we appointed honest and fearless leaders. We immediately placed Chairperson Grace Pulido-Tan in the COA. In the Executive, we likewise appointed uncompromising persons: Commissioner Kim Henares in the BIR and Secretary Leila de Lima in the Department of Justice. They did not back down from any challenge in fulfilling their mandates. To all of you, I give my heartfelt thanks.Whether in the top, middle, or bottom of the bureaucracy, so many have been suspended, removed from their positions, made accountable through cases filed against them, or even imprisoned. If there is anyone who still doubts that justice is blind in the Philippines, it would be best if they turned their attention to the three senators currently detained, or to a former president still under hospital arrest.There are some who say we should move on. Personally, I believe in what George Santayana said: Those who forget the mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat it.Just take a look at the actions of those who have wronged us. They will first work to ensure we forget what they have done. After this, they will say, “Have pity on us.” They already took advantage of us; now they are trying to take advantage of the Filipino’s innate penchant for forgiveness, in order to escape accountability. The next step: they will find a way to return to power. Isn’t that their master plan—so that they can continue to take advantage of us?I learned from my parents, from the church, and from the processes of our laws: Whatever reconciliation must come from the confession and repentance of those who have committed wrong. Can you remember an instance in which anyone said, “I’m sorry I stole from you and abused you; I am ready to change”? For my part: We can only move on once justice has been attained.We continued to reform our institutions, in order to refocus them towards their true mandates. For example: Government Owned and Controlled Corporations. Appointees to GOCCs swore to safeguard our people’s money. The sad fact is, even when the GOCCs were mired in debt, they showered themselves with benefits and incentives left and right. If we liken their institutions to cattle, they’d just as soon butcher the cow for meat, even as they milk it. This is why in the past administration, dividends collected over nine and a half years only amounted to P84.18 billion.Under our administration: the number of GOCCs has already been reduced by shutting down those deemed irrelevant, and yet because of improved management: the dividends we have collected in the five years we have been in office have now reached P131.86 billion. It isn’t unlikely that, before we step down from office, we will be able to double the dividends collected by our predecessor who had much more time to accumulate these funds.This is the same commitment we have shown in the BIR, which is the biggest revenue-generating agency of the government. When we stepped in, the highest collection on record was in 2008, at P778.6 billion. We surpassed this by leaps and bounds. In 2012, the BIR collected P1.06 trillion—the first time in our history we have breached the 1 trillion mark for collections. Last year, the number went up to P1.3 trillion; this 2015, we will collect up to P1.5 trillion.We only needed five years to match, surpass, and almost double our predecessor’s record high—and we did this without imposing new taxes, as promised, apart from Sin Tax Reform.How did we do this? It was simple. I believe that Commissioner Kim Henares is a kind person, but those against whom she filed cases might have a different opinion. Commissioner Kim Henares spared no tax evader. 380 cases have already been filed against those who attempted to evade taxes. She also made the system for tax payment more efficient, and made clear to everyone their civic duty to contribute to the development of our country.For the National Budget: under the previous administration, the budget was always reenacted, whether partially or fully. In 2007, for example, it was almost April when the General Appropriations Act (GAA) was approved. It was already worrying that projects that had been completed received funding once more. Even worse: Even the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses, including salaries, were included in this reenacted budget. What this means: funds were allotted again for salaries—even if all had already received what was due them for the first three months of 2007. I wonder: Where did the excess funds that were allotted and requested for go?What we have proven: If the Executive proposes a reasonable budget, the dialogue with the members of Congress will go smoothly. The faster the GAA is passed, the quicker services will reach our countrymen, and the sooner will we be able to alleviate their suffering.The message was clear: We are serious about change; the playing field is level. The result: Confidence in our economy.When we began, I did not think that we would immediately win back the global community’s confidence in the Philippines. I only thought of fixing the crooked system to prevent our people from sinking deeper into poverty. Let me ask you: Did it ever occur to you that we would continue rising in global competitiveness rankings, and that we would be recognized for the speed with which our economy has grown? In fact, the Philippines is now being called “Asia’s Rising Tiger,” “Asia’s Rising Star,” and “Asia’s Bright Spot.”Now, for the first time in history, we are unanimously deemed investment grade by the most prominent credit rating agencies. This is a signal to businessmen that it is worthwhile to invest in the Philippines. The risks of doing business here have decreased. Now, with lower interest rates and more flexible debt payment schedules, more investors are finding it attractive to bet on the Philippines. Through the institution and expansion of businesses, commerce becomes more lively, competition strengthens, and even more opportunities are created. All this has been a direct result of reforms we made along the Straight Path.Just look: back in 2010, net foreign direct investment in our country was at $1.07 billion. In 2014, net foreign direct investments reached $6.2 billion. This is the highest ever recorded in our entire history.The numbers for domestic investments are likewise impressive; now, Filipinos are betting on their fellow Filipinos. Let us compare: from the time this was first measured back in 2003 until 2010, the amount of approved domestic investments totaled just P1.24 trillion. Under our watch, from the third quarter of 2010 until the end of 2014, the amount invested by our countrymen in the market reached P2.09 trillion.In manufacturing: I admit, during my first year in office, one of the things furthest from my mind was the idea that we could reinvigorate this sector. The industry faced many challenges: electricity, for one, was both expensive and unreliable. It was also no small feat to establish facilities here, because of the large investment involved in buying machines and training employees. This is why, back then, we had to import even low-tech electric fans.Thanks to the reforms that have restored confidence in our nation, manufacturing growth has accelerated—from 3 percent annually between 2001 and 2009, to 8 percent from 2010 to 2014.It is clear: The Filipino can compete. In the past, our only selling point was low wages. Now, investors are bringing to our country factories that produce hi-tech equipment: from aircraft components, electric tricycles, printers, and other digital media products, to high-quality medical devices like aortic catheters and devices for in vitro diagnostics and hemodialysis treatment.Let us listen to a businessman who will tell us of the new business climate in the Philippines:Translated transcript of Testimonial of Peter Perfecto, Makati Business ClubOne of the most important things this administration has accomplished was reversing the corruption trends of the previous administration.Without the rule of law, the advantage went to corporations that were complicit with the systemic bribery and a faulty tax system.President Aquino has walked the talk. He has delivered on his promises. They arrested the former president, the three senators, and ousted a Chief Justice who were all once thought to be “untouchable.”The strong message has been sent. Because of the rule of law and the commitment to good governance this administration has made, our foreign direct investments rose from P2 billion to P6.2 billion.We have made a huge leap forward: jumping 33 places in the rankings set by the World Economic Forum; and according to them, this is a result of this administration’s anti-corruption agenda—all because of the changes that this government has enacted. It is the responsibility of each Filipino to learn from these recent achievements and ensure that we continue moving forward with the coming administration.We all know that the primary measure of economic improvement for the common Filipino is the creation of jobs. Let us look at what we’ve achieved in this area.Every year, around 80,000 new entrants join our labor force. Now, consider the fact that there are reports of overseas Filipinos returning home. In 2011, our Department of Foreign Affairs reported that there were around 9.51 million overseas Filipinos. Based on the latest estimates in December 2014, that number went down to 9.07 million. It is reasonable to say that a good number of the estimated 440,000 Filipinos represented by that decrease came home and were able to find work.Despite the fact that there are new entrants, returnees, and previously unemployed Filipinos, our unemployment rate still dropped to 6.8 percent last year. This is the lowest recorded in a decade. Let me be clear: We created permanent jobs; we did not hire an abundance of street sweepers during the period the labor survey was conducted, just to boost results.Together with creating real jobs, we are also fostering a good relationship between labor and management throughout the country. Let us compare. In the nine and a half years of the previous administration, the number of strikes that occurred were 199, or roughly 21 strikes for each year. In our five years in office, the total strikes were only 15. In fact, in 2013, there was only a single strike recorded in the country. This is the lowest recorded in the history of DOLE.It is because of this that we are truly impressed with Secretary Linda Baldoz and our labor and management sector. To Sec. Linda: You are not only efficient; you are also very positive which makes you the type of colleague who is a pleasure to work with. That is why you are considered the Pastor of the Cabinet. Thank you, very much, for all your efforts, Linda.The transformation has indeed been vast. Before, the signs we would always see proclaimed, “No Vacancy,” didn’t they? Today, announcements that say, “For Immediate Hiring” are scattered everywhere; you need only open a newspaper to see classified ads from many companies who are hiring. Some of them have even been getting creative with incentives. There’s this one company that says: just come in for an interview and your breakfast is on them. Once you’re hired, they’ll cover your treat to friends and family to celebrate your new job.Some businessmen have even mentioned to me that they are finding it difficult to hire accountants. I remember when I was younger, a lot of people were taking up BS Commerce, Major in Accountancy. When I visited Bicol University, I mentioned this to their president. I had to ask: Am I correct in the knowledge that your university has an accountancy program? Their reply: Yes, but even we are having trouble filling our accounting department. Why? Their president said that their students, even in their third year of college, are already being recruited by accounting and auditing firms.This is happening precisely because we have worked to address what is called the job-skills mismatch. In the past, so many of our countrymen were saying that they had no jobs, even when there were so many unfilled positions listed in the PhilJob-Net website. The simple reason: The skillset of our countrymen did not match what the market needed. The solution to this was also simple: Talk to prospective employers and ask them what skills are demanded by the positions they are opening. Now, it is in these skills that we train Filipinos, so that they can maximize opportunities.The principle behind our strategy of governance: Instead of giving our countrymen fish, we will teach them how to fish. We are ensuring that the progress we have made and the opportunities that have been created can be maximized by our fellowmen. We cannot wait for the benefits of growth to trickle down to the poorest Filipinos; we cannot leave it to chance, or hope for the best. Our commitment: inclusive growth.The agenda: assistance, knowledge, skills training, and health, to ensure that no one is left behind. One of our mechanisms: the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program.We have vastly expanded the scope of this program. Now, more than 4.4 million households are feeling the benefits of this program. This is extremely far from the 786,523 households covered by the program when we entered office. This year, 333,673 graduated from high school; they are part of the first batch of beneficiaries under the expanded Pantawid Pamilya. 13,469 of these youth graduated with honors and a variety of awards. In fact, the two beneficiaries I met were accepted into Civil Engineering, a quota course in the University of the Philippines.All of these beneficiaries will gain important knowledge; instead of entering menial jobs once they graduate, it is almost certain that they will find jobs that will pay them a decent salary. Their income tax alone will repay the state’s investment, and we will be able to continue the cycle of empowering those in need. The brighter future that awaits the honor students the program assisted is just an added bonus.Let us listen to one of those assisted by Pantawid Pamilya.Translated transcript of Testimonial of Alyannah, CCT beneficiaryI work much harder now. I knew the trials my family faced because of poverty. When we were enrolled in the Conditional Cash Transfer program, I saw that people wanted to help us. I knew they wanted nothing in return—but, for me, the only way I could repay their kindness was through my studies. The money we get from the government was never wasted. We were able to finance all of my school expenses.I was so happy when I got into my dream school, the University of the Philippines. The CCT program gave me a chance to get a good education, which helped me finish high school; and now I’m on my way to college. I know this program is on the receiving end of a lot of criticism, but I want to tell President Benigno Aquino that they need only to look at me—at us. We are proof that the money set aside by the government for this program is not a dole-out. The money goes towards a worthy pursuit, which I know one day will help uplift the entire country.Under Pantawid Pamilya, in exchange for assistance, the primary focus of beneficiaries must be the education of their children. This has already borne early fruit: According to studies conducted by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, in 2008, there were 2.9 million out-of-school children in the country. The years passed and our population grew, but in 2013, only 1.2 million out-of-school children remained. Let me emphasize the difference: 1.7 million.It’s as if we filled around 42,500 empty classrooms with students. Of course, apart from the Pantawid Pamilya, the Alternative Learning System also helped to ensure that even indigenous peoples and street children are not left behind.And yet, there are still some who ask: Where are the results of Pantawid Pamilya? Our answer: Oh come on. They seem to think that Pantawid Pamilya is like a magic tablet that, once taken by a child in kindergarten, turns that child into a college graduate after only a few hours. Perhaps, they did not have enough time to study during their time; let us help them count: K to 12 lasts 13 years, while my term only lasts for six. Now we see who’s trying to deceive us.There are even some who had the guts to raise an outcry and shout: There are leakages in Pantawid Pamilya. Then we discovered they used data from 2009, just to have something to criticize. Let me remind them: I became President halfway through 2010; perhaps you should be asking another president to explain the alleged leakage. I guarantee that, when the time comes that the beneficiaries of this program are contributing to the economy, those who are criticizing it today will be falling over themselves to proclaim that they are the father or mother of the expanded Pantawid Pamilya.Now, in the sector of education: We are making sure that the deficits of the past are erased and the needs of the present are addressed, even as we prepare for the future.In just our first two years in office, we were able to close the backlogs we inherited of 61.7 million textbooks and 2.5 million school chairs. In 2013, the backlog of 66,800 classrooms was finally eliminated and the backlog of 145,827 teachers was likewise addressed, with the help of our LGU partners.According to the estimates of DepEd, from 2010 up to 2017, the total amount of new students: 4.7 million. This is because of the increase of enrollees and the implementation of the K to 12 program. In order to meet this vast increase, we need to add an estimated 118,000 classrooms to what we already have. 33,608 of these have already been constructed. This year, we are slated to construct more than 41,000 more. Funds for the remaining 43,000 classrooms have already been included in the proposed 2016 budget that we will pass tomorrow, which we hope you will approve.The number of teachers we will need are estimated at 130,000. In 2014, we have already hired 29,444. This year, the total number of teachers we target to hire: 39,000. The remaining 60,000 positions will be covered in the proposed 2016 budget, which we hope you will approve as well. According to Bro. Armin, the sum total of the classrooms our administration has constructed and the teachers we have hired exceeds the cumulative total of classrooms built and teachers hired in the past twenty years before we came into office.We have already turned over 73.9 million textbooks that will be followed by an addition 88.7 million this year. In 2015 as well, 1.6 million school seats were delivered to schools, and we will add another 1.6 million before the end of the year. After eliminating the existing backlog in classrooms, we constructed or continue to construct 33,621 classrooms, while allotting funds for the construction of 41,728 more. For teachers: 39,000 are already being hired by DepEd for this school year alone.Tomorrow, we will submit the budget for 2016; included in it are funds for an additional 103.2 million textbooks, 4.4 million school seats, 43,000 classrooms, and 60,000 new teaching positions. Everyone can see: We will not leave further sources of headaches for those who will succeed us.Let me be clear: We implemented K to 12 because it is not practical to cram learning in a 10-year basic education cycle. May I remind you, that we are one of the three countries left in the world with a 10-year basic education cycle. The credentials of our countrymen working overseas are already being questioned; there are also some who have been demoted because our diplomas are supposedly not proof of sufficient knowledge. If the past educational system can be likened to a mango induced to ripen under artificial circumstances; now, we are ensuring that the abilities of our students are fully developed, so that they can take hold of their futures.Let us listen to a story that is proof of this:Translated transcript of Testimonial of Rezia Joy JianoranMy father has been a jeepney driver all my life. When I was in my second year of high school, my mom suffered a stroke. I didn’t ask, but I knew that they couldn’t afford to send me to college.Instead of dropping out of school, I decided to continue my studies under the K to 12 program. My chosen track of specialization was the Drafting Technology course.Part of the K to 12 program is the career immersion. I was assigned to CLP Metal, a metal fabrication company.I was tasked to design machines. This machine was designed to de-hair pigs. Once a pig is processed, after several seconds, it comes out without any hair.A machine like this can only be bought abroad. Because of the design by CLP, we’re able to adjust to the budget restrictions of our customers.I’m extremely proud because when you think about it: How many 19-year olds can say they have designed a machine?I’m proud that I’m a K to 12 graduate because I can now support my family. And I’m learning while I’m earning.Should these graduates choose to go into tech-voc, the programs we enhanced are already waiting for them. 7.8 million have already graduated from the different courses of the Technical Vocational Education and Training overseen by TESDA. Under the Training for Work Scholarship Program alone, the number of graduates have already reached 821,962. Perhaps you are wondering: What is their situation today? According to studies, 71.9 percent of graduates were able to find employment right away, compared to the 28.5 percent recorded before. There are even some industries breaking records. For example: the employment rate for the entire semiconductors and electronics industry has already reached 91.26 percent—just a little more, and we’ll be at 100 percent.Secretary Joel Villanueva told us before of an OFW forced to return home; she thought there was no hope to improve her lot in life. Then, she studied “hilot wellness massage” in TESDA; now, her spa already has 4 branches. In my last SONA, I also told you of a PWD who was once a barker; he is now an escalation supervisor in a BPO.A success story from the Sari-sari Store Training and Access to Resources Program, or STAR: There was a sari-sari store owner who used to earn 800 pesos a day; now, her daily earnings have reached 4,000 pesos. If you sum everything up, her earnings are more or less equivalent to my salary, even if we do not experience the same type of stress.How did this happen? She was trained in bookkeeping, inventory management, accounting, and other disciplines. What’s extremely impressive: The STAR program even teaches students how to ensure that their profits are maximized.Let us listen to one of those who benefited from TESDA and Coca-cola’s program:Translated transcript of Testimonial of Ma. Theresa Tomaro, TESDA Star Program traineeMy husband and I were both unemployed when we started training with the STAR program. We were taught how to manage and grow a business.When we started our sari-sari store, it was made out of bamboo. Now, its walls are made of concrete.This not only helps us, but also our children. We are able to give them good lives.I’ve been able to sell a lot of things. My income has doubled since then.I’d like to thank Secretary Joel Villanueva because of their program, I was able to have the opportunity to show my ability to run my own business.Now, on the sector of health. To many Filipinos, falling ill poses a serious challenge to the fulfillment of their dreams. Families climbing the ladder of progress, return back to zero once they are struck by illness. Not only are their savings emptied, they also fall deep into debt.When we came into office, only 47 million Filipinos were beneficiaries of PhilHealth. We have almost doubled this number: Just this past June, PhilHealth coverage has reached 89.4 million Filipinos. The transformation we wrought: Before, during elections, new PhilHealth beneficiaries seemed to sprout like mushrooms. Instead of the basis for membership being the interest of Filipinos, it became manipulated to serve the electoral candidate’s interest. Now, we have corrected that system.There is more good news in the sector of health. In 2012, we announced: If your family is part of the lowest quintile, or the poorest 20 percent of our population, and you are seeking treatment in public hospitals, then we guarantee that you will not have to pay a single centavo. Beginning in 2014, this has expanded to cover the next quintile of our society. This means that for the poorest 40 percent of the population, treatment in public hospitals is free. This is the care that some have called inefficient and uncaring. The only thing I have to say to them, as Aiza Seguerra said back in the day: I thank you, bow.Now, let us hear some of the results of the improved PhilHealth program:Translated transcript of Testimonial of Danilo Espiritu, PhilHealth beneficiaryI was diagnosed with quadruple clogs in the coronary area.We didn’t know how we could afford the operation. The first hospital we went to said the operation would cost 300,000 pesos. At [the Philippine General Hospital], it would cost 700,000 pesos. At UST hospital, they said it was 800,000 pesos.But when one of the doctors learned that my wife was covered by PhilHealth, he said our case qualified under the Z-Package, and we could push through with the operation.We just stood up then and went to fix the paperwork, and I was provided the opportunity to extend my life.The service I got at the hospital was comparable to that received by a private hospital patient. I wasn’t considered a charity case. I was a full-fledged paying patient, and PhilHealth paid for my operation.To be honest, I didn’t pay for anything. The little money that we did save, we were able to use for the post-operation expenses.I’m thankful for PhilHealth and our government for implementing these kinds of projects, which genuinely help people in need.Translated transcript of Testimonial of Governor Lilia PinedaSin Tax should have been implemented earlier; it’s the answer to our goal of providing universal healthcare. It was a big help to the province of Pampanga: In the past, the Capitol spent over 400 million pesos a year in health aid. But when the Sin Tax Law was implemented, those who needed healthcare were covered by PhilHealth. We are truly grateful to President Aquino because the project provided a huge relief for Pampanga. The money saved was used to fund other important projects. The proceeds of the Sin Tax also went towards the construction of a birthing station, hospital renovations, and the construction of health centers. We’re so thankful to the President for caring for the poor who suffer sickness.Let us again return to the story of the past five years. We went after the corrupt and we cleaned the systems, which redounded to confidence in our markets. Businesses came into the country, opportunities expanded, all while we empowered Filipinos to gain decent employment. They patronized these businesses, which, having recognized that the playing field is level, know they can profit without having to resort to illegal activities. They then expand their operations, and employ even more people. This is a cycle: justice, trust, economic growth, the creation of opportunities, progress. Boss, this is the very spirit of, “Where there is no corruption, there is no poverty.”And we did not just achieve change. The transformation we are experiencing today has already exceeded the expectations we had in the beginning.The Cadastral Survey, which was started in 1913, has been completed by us. It took almost a century for those who came before us to complete 46 percent of this survey. The more than half left to be done, we finished in just five years in government. This Cadastral Survey identifies the boundaries of the land covered by each city, municipality, and province in the Philippines. In ARMM, for example, it was as if the land gave birth to more land: According to the maps, there are only 1.2 million hectares belonging to the region, but if we were to add up all the lands being claimed, they would reach a total of 3.7 million hectares. Now, because we have fixed the land record system through the Cadastral Survey, no new land will be birthed in ARMM.In 2011, we conducted an inventory of sitios, and we identified those that were still without electricity. Through the Sitio Electrification Program, we were able to bring light to 25,257 communities identified through this inventory. On top of this, because of the use of solar energy and other technology, even far-flung and isolated areas that would be difficult to connect to the grid already have electricity. Now, around 78 percent of sitios in the Philippines have already been energized; the DOE has guaranteed that, before we step down from office, all the rest of the sitios from the 2011 tally will have electricity.Now, let us watch a farmer who has benefited from our Sitio Electrification Program.Translated transcript of Domingo BonifacioIt was difficult when we didn’t have electricity; you just had to bear with it. We could only power our homes with fuel sources.We first got electricity this July, and we were so happy when switched on the lights here at home for the very first time. We can now watch movie tapes or listen to good music. The children are now able to study at night. I’m even able to work at night because now I can charge my spotlight during the day, and because I’m more productive, I earn more.Translated transcript of Mayor Abraham Akilit, Bauko, Mountain ProvinceOur lives have changed for the better now that we finally have access to electricity. We’re able to be more efficient—an example would be our weaving. With sewing machines, we can create more beautiful designs, which we can sell at a better price. Food processing needs equipment, which runs on electricity. Students can use the Internet for research. Electricity has brought good things to Bauko. Congratulations to our President for making Bauko a better place to live in.In the sector of aviation, there has also been a steady stream of good news: in 2013, the International Civil Aviation Organization lifted the significant safety concerns it had imposed on our country back in 2009. In the same year, the European Union allowed our flag carrier to resume its flights to Europe. The following year saw another local carrier receiving approval from the European Union, while the US Federal Aviation Administration upgraded us to Category 1, from the Category 2 downgrade we had received in 2008.Because of these developments, incoming and outgoing flights are increasing, and it is also becoming easier for tourists to fly around the Philippines. Even better news: Just this June, the EU Air Safety Committee removed its ban on all our air carriers—the first time that it has lifted its ban on the entire civil aviation sector of a country. Now, all our airlines will be able to fly directly to the United Kingdom, Italy, and other countries part of the EU.In seafaring: In 2006, the European Maritime Safety Agency or EMSA was already questioning our compliance to the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers. Because of this, there was a threat that the EU would no longer recognize our maritime education certificates. If we did not act, there would have been the chance that an estimated 80,000 Filipino seafarers working on European boats would be out of jobs.MARINA and the DOTC went to work quickly in order to match our maritime education certificates to global standards. To this day, the EU continues to recognize our certifications. Come EMSA’s next audit, which will begin in October, MARINA guarantees: We will definitely pass.To Sec. Jun Abaya: May you not waver in your resolve, even when it seems that some have forgotten all that you have done for our sailors, ICAO’s lifting of the significant safety concerns it had imposed on our sector, the European Union’s lifting of the ban on our airplanes, and the Federal Aviation [Administration] upgrading us to Category 1. It was also you who banned boats from setting out to see during typhoons, which helped to keep passengers away from danger. It is now rare for us to receive news about ships sinking during typhoons. All of these achievements have seemingly been cast aside, because of the complicated challenges in the public transport sector. The biggest example of this is the MRT.Few mention that we have partners from the private sector in this endeavor, who remember their entitlements, but seem to have forgotten their obligations. This partner of ours is supposed to be in charge of maintenance. In 2008, there should have been a general overhaul of the MRT, but upon DOTC’s inspection, only token cosmetic changes were undertaken. This lack of care practically guaranteed the breakdown of our trains. Is it not in the interest of all companies to make sure that they get their money’s worth from their investment? Yet, they allowed the situation to deteriorate, to the point where, at very short notice, they just passed the job of improving the MRT onto us.When we made moves to undertake improvements, suddenly, they wanted to take back the responsibility of maintenance. However, their proposal was significantly more expensive than hours. This would, of course, translate to added expense and aggravation for our people. We did not agree to this, and began the process of obtaining new train coaches. But because the MRTC was adamant, they were able to obtain a TRO on the procurement. That is why the MRT situation has come to this.Sec. Jun: You, I, and the entire population of Metro Manila are not pleased with what is happening. The private sector relegated its responsibility to us; when we made moves to provide a solution, they blocked us. It is clear that our agenda and that of the MRTC will never meet. Now, we are taking steps to buy out the corporation. Once this is fixed, the state will be the sole decisionmaker.While we are undertaking this process, we are already implementing immediate maintenance work. Bigger, more long-term solutions are also set to arrive. Next month, we can expect the delivery of the prototype for new coaches; once this passes scrutiny, beginning in January, three coaches will be delivered every month until our order of 48 coaches has been completed. The process to obtain new rails is underway, together with the upgrading of the signaling and automatic fare collecting systems; all this, we expect to be completed before we step down from office. The power supply of our trains will be upgraded before the end of 2016. There are 12 escalators that will be fixed before the end of the year, while the procurement for the rehabilitation of 34 more escalators and 32 elevators is ongoing. Let me remind everyone: When it comes to these matters, we cannot take shortcuts in the processes; we do not want our measures to be hampered by lawsuits left and right.There are some who say that I wear blinders, when it comes to those who have long been my companions on the Straight Path. Me? I see the good things, but I also see the bad. Am I the one with blinders? Or is it those who insist on seeing only the bad things?On our Armed Forces: Back in November 2010, tensions arose once more between North and South Korea; there were fears that war would break out in the peninsula. We needed a plan to evacuate the 46,000 Filipinos in South Korea, as well as the eight Filipinos in North Korea.When I asked the AFP about the assets we could use in an evacuation, they said that the Air Force has a lone C-130. The shortest duration for a round trip? 10 hours. The capacity: around 100 people. I made some calculations: We needed to move 46,000 Filipinos away from conflict, which meant that, under the most ideal conditions, we would need 460 round trips, which would take 4,600 hours each. This is equivalent to 200 days of travel. No one can count on an old C-130 to cope with such heavy usage. If we deployed ships, each could carry 1,000 people at a time, but we would be lucky if each round trip could be completed within 10 days. Should further conflict break out, there was the chance that the entire situation would have been over by the time we evacuated of our people. We took immediate action to address these limitations.Now, from one functional C-130, we now have three at our disposal, and we are planning to acquire two more. There are others to accompany them: The first of three C-295 medium lift transports has arrived, with the other two arriving within the year. We also expect the delivery of two more light lift transports before the end of 2015.If we ever encounter another spate of problems like what happened in 2013, we are going to need more assets. When Yolanda struck, our docks were destroyed, and our ability to deliver aid was hampered. In such situations, landing craft utilities are invaluable because of their ability to dock on any shore. Now, we have increased the number of our landing craft utilities from four to ten. There is the BRP Tagbanua. By next week, two Landing Craft Heavy will arrive from Australia; the turnover of these vessels was very generous: They even came with spare parts and generators. We plan on buying three more; once all the paperwork has been put in order, the processes to procure them will begin. These vessels will reduce our dependence on the kindness of other nations; we will be able to accelerate delivery to different parts of the Philippines, and more promptly send aid, supplies, and other heavy equipment such as bulldozers, which are needed for clearing and relief operations.To better watch over our territory, we have also acquired 12 FA-50 fighters to replace our F5 fighter jets that were retired in 2005. The first two units will arrive in December, and the rest of the deliveries will be completed by 2017. We have also acquired war ships such as the BRP Gregorio del Pilar and the Ramon Alcaraz, seven of 13 AW-109 helicopters, six of eight Bell-412 helicopters, 617 troop carrier trucks, and 50,629 assault rifles. Our target is to obtain two more frigates, six Close Air Support Aircrafts, 142 armored personnel carriers, and other new items such as 49,135 units of force protection equipment, 2,884 grenade launchers, and an additional 23,622 assault rifles. In total, we have completed 56 projects for modernization, and I have approved 30 more. Compare this to the 45 projects completed by the three administrations that came before us combined.Let us listen to one of our servicemen from the Air Force:Translated transcript of Testimonial of Jun Perry, member of the Philippine Air ForceFor the record, Sir, our Air Force now has actual force. There was a joke or stigma back then that the Air Force was all air and no force.I’ve only recently joined the Philippine Air Force, but I spent four years in the Philippine Military Academy, where we learned of the value of air power and air defense. During those four years, we found that the Philippine Air Force was losing its strength. But luckily the long wait is over.In December of 2012, President Aquino signed RA 10349. Now, the Philippine Air Force is receiving adequate advancement. It boosts morale. I’ve heard confirmation from our Army classmates themselves. One of them even said: “Mistah, when I heard the sound of the chopper taking flight, I was so inspired.”This is a dream that has slowly, but surely turned into a reality.As for our police, for the first time in our history, each of our policemen has his or her own firearm. Furthermore, to improve the capacity of our police force to shoot, scoot, and communicate, we have distributed 302 patrol jeeps, which are only part of the 2,523 that we have procured. We have also distributed 179 of 577 new utility vehicles, as well as 12,399 handheld radios. We are likewise procuring 30,136 long firearms, 3,328 investigative kits, and another 16,867 radios. Let us listen to some of our policemen, who talk about how these efforts have helped them in their work:Translated transcript of Testimonial of Melvin VelasquezWhen I entered the police service in 2003, I was issued a .38 revolver. Sometimes some of the criminals we encountered were equipped with high-powered weapons. The .38 revolver paled in comparison to the ones used by criminals. In fact, I had to buy my own gun.It is difficult for us law enforcers when we encounter situations where we really have to risk our lives.It was a big change when all policemen were finally given their own guns. We know that we can depend on the firearms issued by the government to us.Those of us in the service dream of owning our own house and lot; it was only during this administration that such a dream was realized.As a low-ranking law enforcer, I really feel the reforms instituted by our President—one of which is the value accorded to the national police. The only way we can possibly repay all these good things is by fulfilling our duties in the correct and right way—even if it means sacrificing my life.Our drive to improve our police force’s equipment is complemented by our “work smarter” strategy. This has been brought to life by Oplan Lambat-Sibat, whose pilot program was implemented in Metro Manila. We studied how criminals operate and strategically deployed our policemen. This is how we have caught the “big fish” gang leaders, dismantled syndicates, and lowered crime rates across the nation.During our term, almost 163,000 people on the wanted list have been apprehended by the PNP, more than 1,000 gangs have been neutralized, and 29,294 unlicensed guns have been confiscated in the country. In NCR: From January to June of 2014, there was an average of 37 cases of murder and homicide every week. Thanks to Oplan Lambat-Sibat, this has gone down to 23 cases per week as of June 2015. In terms of robberies, thefts, and carnapping incidents in the same period: The weekly average in NCR has gone down to 444, from 919.Just last week, Dexter Balane, the leader of the robbery and holdup group in cahoots with the Martilyo gang, was apprehended by our police force. Also in the apprehended list are the notorious Tiamzon couple, Commander Parago, and other cadres of the CPP-NPA-NDF such as Ruben Saluta and Emmanuel Bacarra; there is also the elusive Jovito Palparan, as well as the leaders of the BIFF, namely Basit Usman, Mohammad Ali Tambako, Abdulgani Esmael Pagao, and the international terrorist Marwan.It is clear for all to see: The State nurtures its men and women in uniform, and they are abundantly reaping this care. Together with new equipment, we have also increased the combat pay of our soldiers, as well as the subsistence allowance of the entire uniformed services. We have put up more than 57,000 housing units for our men and women in uniform, and this number will reach 81,000 before I step down from office. In our camps, we also have livelihood programs, and among those benefiting from these are the soldiers who have been wounded or disabled in the course of fulfilling their duty. To heighten our focus on them, I have already ordered our AFP to work together with our Cabinet and implement initiatives that will ensure that those who have sacrificed for the nation will have decent livelihoods.Let us now talk about infrastructure. I remember when I was a Congressman in Tarlac: During summer, the Tarlac River was like a desert. During the rainy season, the river would surge and overflow, with the MacArthur Highway among the areas affected by flooding. I asked, who is in charge of flood control in our district? We approached the Pampanga River Delta Project. They said that the Lower Agno Project had jurisdiction over us. Then, when we went to them, they told us to go back to Pampanga. Instead of helping us, they chose to point fingers at each other.The time of skirting responsibility has ended. On the Straight Path, long-awaited infrastructure projects are constructed one after the other. I have already mentioned some of them: There is the Lullutan Bridge in Isabela, which our countrymen in the province had anticipated for two decades, like Rodito Albano; it is now open. The Jalaur River Multi-Purpose Project, in Iloilo, was conceptualized around the time of my birth; we have recently broken ground for stage 2 of this project. The Balog-Balog Multipurpose Project Phase 2 in Tarlac was planned in the 1980s. It has now been approved and the bidding process has already started.Construction of the Basilan Circumferential Road started in back in 2000, but was long-delayed because of conflict in the province. Hostile elements have blocked its completion because as soon as it is constructed, they will have a more difficult time escaping the law. The delivery of services to the area would also be expedited, thus weakening their influence on the locals. The vast majority of the road is now passable, and only three bridges are still being finished.I have already mentioned the Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway, which opened last Friday. The first two stages of the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway or TPLEX are also open; it is the same for the Phase 2 of the STAR Toll. When the Cavite-Laguna Expressway Project, the C-6 Phase 1, the Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, and the NLEX-SLEX Connector Road are completed—all the more will the benefits of our infrastructure strategy reach even more people.To address flooding, we have the ongoing repairs and maintenance of our flood control projects. Among these is the Pasig-Marikina River Channel Improvement Project Phase 2, which was completed in 2013. The high-impact flood control projects for the NCR and its surrounding areas are slated for completion in November, and our target is to complete the Blumentritt Interceptor Catchment Area by next year. The Laguna Lakeshore Expressway Dike project, meanwhile, will be awarded this December.I am sure that everyone can see: It does not matter if local officials belong to our party, or if we won in these provinces; the only question we ask: Is there a need for this project? Let us listen to some of those we have helped:Translated transcript of Testimonial of Governor Elias BulutWhen the President first ran for senator, he lost in our province. When he ran for President, he lost again. In spite of that, the President still helped our province. We are witness to his style of governance. The administration recognizes the problems of the region and responds based on need, rather than considering the votes they earned here. Our province used to be neglected—because of the meager funds given to us by previous administrations. People here had to walk for about two days to get to their destination. With the construction of this new road, so many opportunities are going to open up for the people of Apayao. Agriculture here is booming, and the people finally feel that there actually is a government that looks after them. To the President, we hope you can come over, so you can see what you’ve done here. What used to be far is so much nearer now because of the good roads you’ve built.Translated transcript of Testimonial of Rep. Mercedes AlvarezWhen I met the President in Bacolod City, I thanked him because our road was already finished; he said, “Don’t thank me. Thank our bosses.” And of course he told me not to lie down on the road again.What happened before this was that I was on my way up to Candoni, and I saw the road that the DPWH had worked on was finally completed. I was so happy that I decided to take a picture right there.Travel time has been cut in half, thanks to the new national road. Candoni used to be a very isolated area. Investors didn’t want to make their way there because of the state of the roads. But now the roads are good; public transport ply these routes. Students now don’t have to walk all the way to school because now they can commute. When you plant sugarcane, you have to bring it all the way to the central market. But now, with our new roads, planting will be easier, more economical, and cheaper.Mr. President, on behalf of the people in Cauayan, Hino-baan, Ilog, Candoni, Kabankalan, and Sipalay in the province of Negros Occidental, we want to thank you for your commitment, your projects, and your programs. Mabuhay po kayo!To Governor Bulut, in the Senatorial election of 2007, I was only 20th in the hearts of the people in your province, and I was only 4th during the presidential elections. But given all the infrastructure we have built, I do not think anyone can say that you aren’t in the hearts of the Filipino people. You yourselves have witnessed that when it comes to projects, our basis is need, not votes.Now, to Congresswoman Alvarez, who has, on a number of occasions, posed lying down on the roads we have built in her district: I am sorry, Chedeng, but the next time you lie down on the road, I will have you arrested. The violation: obstruction of traffic.Our strategy is clear: In constructing roads, bridges, and other infrastructure, we reduce the suffering where we must, and we accelerate the delivery of benefits. I only ask that we all contribute in the effort, and that we be willing to make sacrifices.For example: To address flooding in Manila, we pushed for the construction of a catchment area, which was protested by a particular university. They said that some of their old buildings could be affected by the project. Another example: There is already a need to retrofit the Guadalupe bridge, because it is vulnerable to earthquakes. But can we close down this bridge without completely shutting down EDSA? This bridge cannot be fixed through conventional means; we need to open up an alternative path. One proposal estimates that 70,000 vehicles would be able to pass through the route. Thus, if we can get this done, we can retrofit Guadalupe. The problem is that the chosen path for the route has been protested by a number of groups. They agree that Guadalupe has to be retrofit, and they also agree with our plan to address heavy traffic along EDSA, but they do not want to be inconvenienced by the structures we need to construct. Such an attitude delays the construction of much needed infrastructure.There have also been times when assistance was not only denied; roadblocks were also put in our path by officials on the local level. For example, there was an area devastated by a calamity. We went there as soon as possible; I was greeted by the Congressman and the Mayor, but it was the City Administrator and Vice Mayor who spoke with me. We told them: The DPWH has the necessary equipment, and we are ready to put up temporary shelters; all we need is land on which to construct them. Their answer: There are 30 hectares that can be used. Unfortunately, when I returned, not a single bit of land was turned over to us because they said they were using them for something else.That is just one horror story. For our part: We are here to help. We will do everything in our power to give as much assistance as we can, in accordance with the law. If they do not want to cooperate, the only thing I will say is this: Next year is an election year, and our Bosses will be the ones to decide who has alleviated, or added to, their suffering.Let us now move on to the area of Public-Private Partnerships. If we add together all the solicited PPP Projects of the past three administrations, the grand total: six projects. Under our watch, the number of solicited PPP project: 50. Of this number, 10 have been awarded; 13 are being bidded out; while 27 are still in the pipeline. You can judge the difference for yourselves.Back then, no one would join these projects; now, private companies are competing with one another, and are even paying us premiums. The premiums we have received from our private sector partners in the PPP have reached P64.1 billion, which goes directly to our national coffers. Each successful project redounds to even greater confidence in the Philippines, which will in itself help accelerate the process of putting up the rest of the infrastructure we need. The suffering of our people will be lessened, and may even come to an end.As for infrastructure about to be constructed, my sole request is for all of us to calm down. The procurement process is long; in fact, four months to complete the process is already considered fast. You could be considered lucky if the computer you ordered is delivered within that time. Just imagine the process when it comes to the construction of bridges.For my part: It doesn’t matter if I am unable to preside over the groundbreaking or ribbon-cutting. What is important is that these projects are well-planned and legal, so that when they are approved, construction can proceed quickly; the quality of the structure will withstand anyone’s scrutiny. The Cabinet already knows this: When we have Cabinet or NEDA Board meetings, I have sometimes joked that attendees should bring their own blankets because the meetings will likely go on until late evening. This happens because I examine each detail carefully, so that when we present these projects to our Bosses, they will also say, “We approve of this because the process has been transparent, and we’re sure that these projects will benefit us.”Without doubt, the transformation we are feeling is vast. Whereas before, the capacity of Filipinos to hope was wavering; now, according to the latest Social Weather Station survey, eight out of ten Filipinos believe that the Philippines can be—if not already is—a developed nation. There is also a survey from Gallup Inc., which has been in business for 80 years now and is considered the oldest and one of the most respected polling agencies in the world. They asked the citizens of 145 countries: “Would you say that now is a good time or a bad time to find a job?” The result: The Philippines ranked number one in terms of job optimism for the Asia-Pacific region, and number two in the entire world.Indeed: Our countrymen are confident in the stability of their future. Even newly hired employees today can make regular payments on cars or condominium units. Given this, it should not come as a surprise that, just last year, car sales in the Philippines grew by 27 percent. The belief now: We can afford to pay not only the down payment, but also the monthly amortizations as well. With so many of our countrymen able to purchase cars, two major automobile companies in the country now take two and half to three months to deliver cars to buyers. In my own experience, the first time I was employed, I computed how long it would take for me to buy my own car. The result of my calculations: It would take me 20 years, and that’s for a secondhand vehicle.I was also given the chance to speak with the leaders of two big foreign companies: One already has a factory here, while the other intends to enter our market. Both of them expressed a strong interest in setting up research and development facilities in the Philippines. They recognize the potential and talent of the Filipino, which they believe can help them maintain their edge in their respective industries. They asked us: Can you supply us with the hundreds of employees with master’s and doctoral degrees in engineering that we need? The DOST’s response: “Of course.” I even said: If companies would start hiring for high-tech industries here, perhaps our countrymen would come home and accept lower pay, so that they could be with their loved ones. Their answer: There’s no need to lower the salaries; we will match whatever they are earning abroad.Even when it comes to our fisheries sector, the way the world views us has changed completely. Just this April, the European Commission lifted the yellow card warning it had imposed on the Philippines. In the past, there were some problems with the documentation and tracking of caught fish; for this reason, the Commission could not ascertain whether the fish were caught legally. Our administration immediately worked to prevent the Philippines from being included in the EU’s blacklist, and thus avoided any ban on our exports. I later learned that when Secretary Procy Alcala was in Belgium, he was told that the Philippines should not resent the attention if other nations with yellow card status approached us. After all, we are the ones in a position to teach them the initiatives and steps to resolve the problem.I also remember how, in the beginning, I felt that leaders of some countries only spoke to us because they were obligated to do so. Some even seemed to be scolding us when I first interacted with them. Now, we receive invitations for State Visits one after the other, with all these leaders offering praises. Some leaders even go so far as to propose that we could arrive in the morning, and that they wouldn’t take it against us if we leave at noon, so long as we make the visit. Once, I was even surprised to receive this question from the leader of a progressive country: “What is your secret?” Of course, since bragging isn’t in our nature, my response was: “Our secret is that we followed your good example.” There are also instances when we and members of our delegation were asked: “It’s really exciting in the Philippines now; is your term truly limited to six years? Can’t anything be done to fix this?” Every time, our answer is: “We once had a president who did everything he could to stay in power. We need to make sure that the doors that would lead to such a situation will never be reopened.”Of course, even if there is evidence of concrete transformation left and right, there are still those who oppose the Straight Path. They say: We work slowly. They say that when they become President, without a doubt, our lives will improve. Those who are of an advanced age will probably answer this with a raised eyebrow and an “Oh really?” The younger generation will simply say: “Yeah, right.”We ask: How will they do this? They say: We’ll take care of it. We ask, where are the details and concrete plans? How will they fulfill these promises? Again: We’ll take care of it. It’s like they think they can pass off these kinds of vague answers as solutions to the problems we face.Unfortunately, no medicine has yet been invented to help those who play deaf and blind. My advice: At times when our intelligence as a people is clearly being insulted, we should just change the channel; we might benefit more from watching a sitcom.Now, I wish to talk about legislation, which I hope will be passed during the term of this Congress.The most important of these: the Bangsamoro Basic Law. To those who oppose this measure: I believe that it is incumbent upon you to suggest more meaningful measures. If you do not present an alternative, you are only making sure that progress will never take root in Mindanao. Let me ask you: How many more of our countrymen will have to perish before everyone realizes that the broken status quo of Muslim Mindanao must change?I invite you to listen to some of those who can benefit from this law:Translated transcript of Testimonial of Nor-ashia Binatac, 4Ps beneficiaryBefore, because we were poor, we had no food. We only had sweet potatoes. That’s it. That’s all we’d eat for breakfast and dinner.It’s a hard life when you’re a farmer. You work hard to till the land; and when you sell your produce, you can only sell them for so much.I felt terrible because I saw how just difficult it was for my family to cope. I used to think and wish that I had the opportunity to finish my studies—so that I could help my family leave this horrible state of poverty.I was in 6th grade when they rolled out the Conditional Cash Transfer program here. It was a big relief to see my father have money for my studies. I thought, before this program, I didn’t even have a notebook or a pair of shoes. Now, with the support of government, I can really focus on my studies, so that I can help my parents one day.I’d like to thank the DSWD and the government, because they thought of doing this for the poor. If it weren’t for them, our lives wouldn’t have changed.Translated transcript of Testimonial of Nadjieb Sanquila and Hadid Hassan, MILF combatantsSanquila: The injustice during that period was indescribable. Because it was Martial Law, they saw us Moros as mere animals. We were being killed and massacred with no remorse. My family was among the victims of those massacred by the soldiers. That is what hurts the most; this is why we are here today. We joined the Moro Islamic Liberation Front to fight for our rights.Hassan: When I joined the MILF, our principles were premised upon nasshur awis-shahada. For example under President Estrada’s administration, the people of Mindanao were under the threat of annihilation. Of course, any Muslim would think to defend those principles.If you are a Muslim, you are part of the Bangsamoro. You were, therefore, viewed as a terrorist, and would not be given any work—because you might end up destroying the company.The Sajahatra has now arrived. We were more encouraged by this: we learned and applied what we learned. For me, this may be the path for our brothers and sisters in the Bangsamoro to lead peaceful lives, and have the wherewithal to lift themselves out of poverty.Since 1972, I have never experienced a peaceful Bangsamoro; but today, if the agreement is fulfilled, with Allah’s blessing, we might finally be able to live in peace.I also wish to put forward the bill on the Rationalization of Fiscal Incentives. Once enacted into law, this will correct the many loopholes in the provisions of our incentives and will rationalize taxation for our businesses. We also ask for the urgent passage of the Unified Uniformed Personnel Pension Reform Bill, so that we can finally set up a sustainable and just pension system for our uniformed services. I cannot stress just how important the passage of this law is: At present, we already need trillions of pesos to fund the pensions of our servicemen. We need the authorization from Congress to address this very complicated situation.Tomorrow, you will receive the proposed budget for 2016. We have never failed to pass the national budget on time; thus, it is my hope that we will continue this correct practice, especially that we are now in the final stretch of the administration.Also, might I share: There used to be a time when I was against depriving a person the right to run for office, just because he had a famous family name. Why would we pass legislation to stop a person who really wants to be a public servant?But I have realized: There is something inherently wrong in giving a corrupt family or individual the chance at an indefinite monopoly of public office. It is exactly for that reason that, when someone suggested that I stay on as President, even just for three more years, I myself argued against it. If I agreed to this suggestion, I would open the door for such a practice to be repeated in the future. And we cannot be certain if the person who will succeed me will possess sincere intentions—he may instead choose to lord it over our people to pursue his personal interest. I believe it is now time to pass an Anti-Dynasty Law.It is because of this Congress that laws that now stand as the solid foundations of transformation were passed. To those in the House of Representatives and the Senate, especially to your members who have been our partners on the Straight Path for all these years: Thank you for the Philippine Competition Law, for the Act Allowing the Full Entry of Foreign Banks, and for the amendments to the Cabotage Law. Thank you for the Sin Tax Reform Act. Thank you for the Responsible Parenthood Act. Thank you for all the other meaningful laws that you passed. Indeed: So much is achieved when we have a Congress that is determined to usher in real progress.A while ago, I thought it best to speak about where we came from, in order to give sufficient context for the challenges that we faced, continue to face, and will still face, and also for the criticism hurled at us. All of this censure, ridicule, and abuse, I accepted as part and parcel of the opportunity to serve you. The truth is, I did not have to go through this alone. Now, I will ask for some of your time to thank those who were our inspiration and partners; I hope that others will understand if I cannot mention them today.First and foremost, of course, to our Lord, who, in every moment, guided our country. To my father and mother, who in fighting abuse and in rendering great sacrifice, became a wellspring of inspiration, not only to our family, but to the entire nation.To my Cabinet, some of whom I have already mentioned earlier. Now, allow me to continue:To Executive Secretary Jojo Ochoa, who is also called the Little President: Our strong relationship began way back, with our parents. We have supported each other through many challenges in life. Your private practice was sacrificed in the length of time that you served the public, first in Quezon City then in my administration. Everything you know about the law, you shared with me. You did not leave me, even in times when there were threats to our lives. Pare, I am lucky that we met, became friends, and became allies in serving our Bosses;To Secretary Rene Almendras, ES Ochoa’s partner and taskmaster of the Cabinet: Your forehead was once so smooth, now it seems to be riddled with a barangay’s humps because you shared the burden of the challenges we faced;To Secretary Albert del Rosario: You took your oath on a Friday, by Sunday, you were in Libya to oversee the evacuation of our OFWs whose lives were in danger during the time of the Arab Spring. Motivating you has never been a problem, and if we have ever debated anything, that is because of me doing my best to keep him from traveling to the most dangerous places in the world;To Secretaries Cesar Purisima and Arsi Balisacan: A tandem our country is lucky to have: From the big picture to the smallest details, you are the ones who ensure that each Filipino feels the benefits of the growth of our economy; Of course, some of these achievements could not have been realized without the help of Usec.

It takes only one conversation to see that you are on top of the situation;To all those who continue to ensure that succeeding generations have the necessary knowledge and skills: Secretaries Armin Luistro, Patti Licuanan, and Joel Villanueva;To Secretary Mario Montejo, who did much to bring hope back to PAGASA, and indeed worked hard to make us feel the role of science in national development;To Secretaries Procy Alcala and Kiko Pangilinan, who have sown reforms already bearing fruit in the agriculture sector;To Secretary Gil de los Reyes, who did not waver in advancing just agrarian reform, however daunting the challenges he faced;To Secretaries Ramon Paje, Neric Acosta, and Lucille Sering, whose work showed that inclusive growth is tied to safeguarding our natural resources;To Secretary Mar Roxas: Whether you are in or out of government, the enemies of the Straight Path have not stopped criticizing you. Because you count, because your words matter, they have continued to do their best to put you down; Through their constant attacks on your character, your critics themselves have proven that they are afraid of your integrity, skill, and ability to do the job. It’s only because they have nothing to boast of that they’re trying to bring you down. Mar, you are proving: You can’t put a good man down. Just as my mother and father had faith, so too should you have faith that our countrymen know who truly puts country before self;To Secretary Butch Abad, who, even though he has received torrents of unfair accusations, continues to ensure that the money of the Filipino people directly benefits the people alone;To Secretaries Edwin Lacierda and Sonny Coloma, former Secretary Ricky Carandang, together with Usec. Abi Valte and Manolo Quezon, who were the voices and online presence of the Straight Path: Truly, I felt the burden that you carried in answering questions, whether they made sense or not, to make sure that our countrymen received all the right information;To Solicitor General Florin Hilbay and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Ben Caguioa, who have displayed the honesty and integrity fitting of the Executive’s foremost attorneys;To Secretary Ging Deles, as well as Chair Iye Coronel-Ferrer, who have worked tirelessly towards a peaceful Philippines;To Secretary Julia Abad, who makes sure that I attend to all my responsibilities: You are the person I call on to take immediate action, which means that you also often bear the full brunt of my first reaction. Nevertheless, you have always remained cheerful;To all the other Secretaries who never fail to pick up the phone, even if I call past midnight: Yasmin Busran-Lao, Francis Tolentino, Lu Antonino, Joel Rocamora, Mely Nicolas, Ronald Llamas, Cesar Villanueva, and Manny Mamba;To those who may not be official members of the Cabinet, but have nevertheless done their part to help us progress along the Straight and Righteous Path: Governor Say Tetangco, who has deftly managed our Central Bank; Governor Mujiv Hataman of the ARMM; Chito Cruz of the National Housing Authority; Gerry Esquivel of the MWSS; and let me also include Chairman Bong Naguiat of PAGCOR, who was not among those who bought coffee;To former members of the Cabinet who put their skill and competence in full display, especially the late Sec.

You know that, unlike my sister Kris, I am not used to being in front of a camera. Even if I kidded that your jobs seemed impossible, you fulfilled them in a professional and reliable manner;To my spiritual advisers, Father Catalino Arevalo, Sister Agnes Guillen, and Father Jett Villarin, and to Cardinal Chito Tagle, Cardinal Orlando Quevedo, Ka Eduardo Manalo, Bishop Soc Villegas, Bishop Jonel Milan, and Brother Eddie Villanueva; to all those in the religious sector and to those who have prayed for us as we faced major challenges;To those like Joe America, a blogger who, despite never having met me, wrote: “If the President were in my foxhole, I’d watch his back. That’s because I trust that he is watching mine.” I thank you and all our other friends from other shores who have express their unity with our transformation agenda;To members of the youth like Francesca Santiago, who, at an early age, has displayed love for country;To Noel Cabangon, and all those in culture and the arts who have used their talents to proclaim our country’s transformation;To Ate Ballsy, Pinky, Viel, Kris, and my brothers-in-law and nephews and nieces: You have stood by me since Mom and Dad were in public service. The day is coming when you will no longer have to make additional sacrifices on my behalf;If I may make a special mention: To General Chito Dizon, former head of the PSG, and to its current head, Raul Ubando, whose first two weeks in charge were a true baptism of fire due to the Zamboanga crisis; to Lt. Col. Francis Coronel, head of my close-in security, as well as to SPO4 Lito Africano and PO3 Bong Fuyonan, who have been with me for such a long time; and to the entire Presidential Security Group, which has displayed utmost professionalism in protecting not just me, but President Obama and Pope Francis as well: Don’t worry. There are 21 more world leaders arriving for APEC. You have stood by me in times of trial and in times of relief. Perhaps later, before you sleep, you will ask yourselves why there seems to be so many trials, and so little relief. We are getting there;To Asec. Susan Reyes, our Social Secretary, who proves that one need not be extravagant to uphold the dignity of the Presidency; to Paul Cabral who makes sure that I always wear proper clothing; and to Cherry Reyes, who is both my hairstylist and an economics practitioner, when it comes to the way she fulfills unlimited wants with very limited resources.To those working in my Private Office in Malacañang, especially to Usec. Rochelle Ahorro and Asec. Jun Delantar, who have, in many occasions, shared in my stress;And I would like to introduce to you Yolly Yebes, who has been with me for the past 20 years: You never fail to make sure I am able to eat my meals at the proper time; you prepare my things for all my trips, whether domestic or foreign; and you have cared not just for me, but also for those I work with in government. Whenever I tell you we have a meeting and ask if you could prepare us something to eat, you don’t have to ask “when” or “how many people.” I never have to worry about those preparations, because you think of everything. Yolly, I wanted you to watch this SONA, so I could tell you: Thank you for all your help;To those who never thought twice about helping repack relief goods in the aftermaths of disasters; to every Filipino who gave what he or she could and passed around coin banks to help bring about transformation; to those who made their support felt, whether through a text message, a letter, or by expressing it personally; to every child who embraced my leg, looked up, and smiled, every student who has asked to have a selfie with me; and to each person who waded through crowds just to shake my hand;My Bosses, perhaps my having no family of my own is part of the plan. It has allowed me to focus on our people. In this job, I sometimes feel like a punching bag precariously held together by duct tape, but I have never wavered because you are behind me. It is true: I am not alone. This has led me to conclude that my parents continue to watch over me, and that God truly loves us. Thus, to every Filipino who has made this change possible, thank you. It is a great honor being your leader.These expressions of gratitude come with a call: The reforms we have sown along the Straight Path are already bearing fruit, and will bear an even more bountiful harvest in the future. But this will only happen if we nurture and protect what we have already planted.Some examples: We cannot just cease to focus on the modernization of the AFP. As for Pantawid Pamilya, once we have helped the bottom twenty percent cross over into the next level, we will need to ensure that they will not return to poverty when they are struck by illness or calamity.In the area of disaster management: Because of concern for one another, and because of the active cooperation of the LGUs, we were able to ensure that Bohol and Cebu regained their footing after the earthquake. In Zamboanga and Tacloban, we focused straightaway on immediate needs. From delivering food, to making certain that there were no outbreaks of disease; from ensuring that electricity returned quickly, to opening roads; and even to housing and livelihood programs—our government poured and continues to pour all it can to help affected areas. Yet there are also things left to be done: There are still communities living in danger zones that must be relocated away from threats to their safety. As regards rebuilding, there is a need to strengthen coordination between the local and national levels, in order to ensure that we finish projects at the soonest possible time.When it comes to foreign affairs: We did and continue to do everything in our power to be a responsible member of the community of nations; with each measure we take, we ask only for what is just and according to the rule of law. Instead of a solution participated in by just a few, we have advocated that all contribute to the solution of a problem that involves us all. As you know, we are facing a challenge in the West Philippine Sea. We are up against a nation that is far ahead of us, whether in terms of influence, the economy, or military force. Yet when it comes to reason and love for country, we do not fall behind. As with all other problems, our unity is the key through which we can uphold our rights.To my Bosses: In all truth, given the challenges that we faced, we could have just put forward band-aid solutions. We could have just handed over a bag of relief goods, or crowded ourselves into photo opportunities. But we all know that in the Philippines, we have a special anger for credit-mongers. What will we do with popularity points if we will just leave problems to succeeding generations? At every opportunity, we sought to identify the correct root of the problem, and implemented a clear and long-term solution to this. Some challenges faced by our country we have overcome; as for the rest, we have begun taking steps towards a permanent solution.That is the biggest difference. Once, there was only hopelessness. Now, people rely on the government; in fact, they expect, anticipate, and in many cases, want the government to resolve the problems our nation faces in the soonest possible time.Looking back, with the sheer volume of wrongs we had to correct, we did not just start from zero; we started from the negative—negative in terms of resources to pursue change; negative in terms of opportunities; negative in terms of hope. We filled the gaps; we brought about positive change, and now, our achievements have far surpassed our expectations.Let us listen to our countrymen who will testify to this transformation:Translated transcriptIn the 25 years that I have worked at PAGASA, I have seen how much of our facilities have improved under the term of our President. Before, PAGASA worked blind. Now, because of the radars and additional observation stations that we have, our capacities to predict the weather have improved. PAGASA is a changed agency. Before, if you said you worked at PAGASA, you were shunned—perhaps because of the quality of the agency’s work. But now, because of all the new equipment, our forecasts are very accurate. Today: If you’re from PAGASA, you’re considered a big shot.Translated transcript of Testimonial of Congresswoman Kaka Bag-aoBack then, you could not trust politicians. They promised so much, but could not deliver on any of their commitments.The leadership brand of President Aquino treats everyone fairly; everyone is important. Services are delivered even to the farthest corners of the country, such as in the Dinagat Islands.Change is so evident. For instance, in the small towns, which used to be without power, there are now generators. There are also new roads.We believe so much in this government. If the President were not our leader today, if we did not have an honorable representative in Congress, we wouldn’t know what our situation would be.We are thankful for this brand of good leadership that has served as an inspiration for other public servants. Now, when we say government service, it is service that is seen, felt, and provides an inspiration for people to hope and dream for further success. I now believe my aspirations can be realized: that my dreams are important and nothing is irrelevant.To our Bosses: If the transformation of our society isn’t interrupted, it would indeed be reasonable to say: All we have achieved is only a taste of what is to come. As we have said before: You ain’t seen nothing yet.I already mentioned a while ago the SWS survey that was not widely covered in the news: that 8 out of 10 Filipinos believed that the Philippines will become—if not, already is—a developed country in the foreseeable future. This is the opinion of our countrymen. But our economists in NEDA themselves are studying this in a scientific manner, and they have reached the same conclusion.Let us take a look: From 2010 to 2014, we posted an average GDP growth of 6.2 percent; this is the fastest period of economic growth in the past 40 years. If we reach 6.8 percent this 2015, then we will have posted the fastest 6 year average growth period in almost six decades. Of course, the growth of our economy means a corresponding growth in government’s ability to care for and empower the citizenry to make the most of opportunities being created in the country.It is clear: If we are not derailed—if we continue along the Straight Path—then we will reach first world status within one generation. If the reforms that have led to our dynamic economic growth continue, then it won’t be long before we can stand on equal footing with, if not, surpass, the very countries we admire. Did we even think this was possible back in the beginning?On the other hand, if we return to the crooked path, we will be condemned to waiting for nothing. We will once again be left behind, and the upward trajectory of our economy will reach a premature end.We have indeed planted impressive reform; and we have already nourished it with intense effort and sacrifice. Who in their right mind would decide to cut the tree down on a whim, when we have only begun harvesting its fruits?There is a sentiment that I want to share with you; it is best captured in the question: “Will we lose all that we have built—all that we have worked hard for—in one election?” From this perspective, the next election will be a referendum for the Straight and Righteous Path. You will decide whether the transformation we are experiencing today will be permanent, or simply a brief and lucky deviation from a long history of failure.The question: Are we treading the right path? If your answer is no, then that is akin to saying “I liked it better before, let’s just go back to the crooked path.” In such a scenario, I will respect your wishes and remain silent.But if your answer is “yes,” then, as always, I am ready to continue supporting you. Even after I step down from office, until my last breath, you can count on me to stand with you, the same way you have stood by me. I will walk alongside you, and with arms linked, we can continue bringing to life the ideals of the Straight and Righteous Path.My bosses, I will admit: I am not perfect. There were times when I was let down by people whom I believed knew how to do their jobs. During moments when those sowing doubt seemed to succeed, perhaps we were unable to share the needed information in a timely and appropriate manner. In these matters, I ask for your understanding.Nevertheless, I can look anyone in the eye and say: I made the best decisions based on the information and the capacities we possessed at the time. My one and only interest is the well-being of my Bosses. I did all I could to forge a nation that is more just and more progressive—one that enjoys the fruits of meaningful change. I will let history decide. As I did during my mother’s wake, I will once again speak the words from 2 Timothy, Chapter 4, Verse 7. And I quote, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.”My bosses, we began with our country seemingly engulfed in darkness. We were uncertain whether there was even a light at the end of the tunnel. Now, we are being greeted by the dawn of justice and opportunity.You have all seen the heights we have reached. You have heard the stories of our fellow Filipinos—stories that prove what we can achieve with our own strength, with the help of our countrymen, and with the spirit of cooperation towards the fulfillment of our collective desires. Now, we can hold our heads up high and say to the entire world: “I can. The Filipino can. This is only the beginning.”Yes: This is only the beginning. This is only the beginning of a country that will not be cowed, and instead will stand as a beacon of justice and resolve in the global community. This is only the beginning of prosperity brought about by freedom from corruption. This is only the beginning of a society where every Filipino who works hard and does the right thing is guaranteed to succeed. This is only the beginning, and now, history poses a challenge to us to continue the transformation, so that it may bring about even more opportunities for future generations.This is only the beginning. We are only in the first chapter of the great story of the Filipino people. Guided by the Almighty, as we continue to tread the Straight Path, we will fulfill even greater aspirations. We will open the doors to even greater progress. Our direction is in your hands.Good evening and thank you very much.(Original Filipino text)Bago po ako magsimula, hihingi ako ng paumanhin dahil hindi natin nagawa ang traditional processional walk; hindi na rin natin nakamayan ang lahat ng nag-abang.

Sa taas din ng kumpiyansa nilang kikita ang proyekto, sabi ng private proponent, libre na ang unang buwan ng toll sa MCX.Talaga nga pong napakalayo na ng ating narating.

"The Maute group, also known as the Islamic State of Lanao, is a radical Islamist group composed of former Moro Islamic Liberation Front guerrillas and some foreign fighters led by Abdullah Maute, the alleged founder of a Dawlah Islamiya, or Islamic state based in Lanao del Sur, Mindanao, Philippines. The group figured in a clash with Philippine Army troops in February 2016 that ended with the capture of their headquarters in Butig, Lanao del Sur.There are reports that Omar Maute, Abdullah's brother, was killed in that clash. There are also reports to the contrary, claiming that he escaped before the camp was overrun and is still alive. Since then the group, which a Philippine Army brigade commander characterized as terrorist, has been conducting a protection racket in the remote settlements of Butig.So what can you say about this one?

"The Philippine National Police has identified the suspected mastermind in the killing of Fr. Richmond Nilo as the uncle of an altar server whom the slain priest had sued for molestation on behalf of three other altar servers.On Monday, PNP Director General Oscar Albayalde — together with Director Roel Obusan, chief of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), and Chief Supt. Amador Corpus, Central Luzon police director — announced the arrest of Manuel Digap Torres for possession of explosives and identified him as the “financier” of the contract killing of Nilo.The killing was allegedly carried out by the group of Omar Lumbang Mallari, alias “Bulik,” the alleged gunman who was arrested two weeks ago.Mallari, who was arrested on a standing warrant for a separate robbery and homicide case, had submitted a confession naming others involved in Nilo’s killing.Among those he implicated was Ronaldo de la Rosa Garcia, Torres’ compadre who had also submitted a statement saying Torres had asked him to find an assassin to kill the priest.Mallari, in the presence of his mother and a public defender, had recorded his confession on video, shown during Monday’s news conference at the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City.Rape charges“Garcia said that [Torres] was angry with Father [Nilo] because [his nephew] Christopher could no longer go to seminary to be trained as a priest because Father had filed rape cases against [Christopher],” Corpus said in Filipino.“The minor victims wanted to drop the complaints, but Father was still pushing for it,” Obusan said.The rapes allegedly happened in March 2017. Christopher Torres is out on bail.“Based on the affidavits of [Mallari] and Garcia, they were hired by Torres for P100,000,” Corpus said.He said the suspects were hired sometime in May or April.Nilo, 44, was shot dead as he was preparing to say Mass at the chapel of Nuestra Señora de las Nieves (not Nieve, as written on the chapel’s facade) in Mayamot village, Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija province, on the night of June 10.The gunman, standing outside, fired through the window of the chapel.Nilo’s slaying sparked public outrage and calls from the Catholic Church for a stop to attacks on members of the clergy who were criticizing President Duterte’s brutal war on drugs.Fr. Mark Ventura, 37, was shot dead after saying Mass in Gattaran, Cagayan province, on April 29. Retired priest Marcelito Paez, 72, was ambushed and killed in Jaen, Nueva Ecija, on Dec. 4 last year. Both were activists.PayoffFr. Rey Urmeneta Jr. was shot as he was being driven home in Calamba City, Laguna province, on June 6. He survived.Corpus said the first payoff, amounting to P40,000, was made three or four days after Nilo was killed.Another P40,000 was paid later but the last P20,000 was not delivered, as Mallari had already been arrested.Mallari was arrested in Arayat, Pampanga province, on June 22 after the CIDG had traced him as the owner of the Nissan Sentra (Plate No. THB 437) that was caught on security cameras tailing Nilo’s car in Zaragoza before the attack on the priest.Security cameras also captured the suspect’s car meeting up in another town with the motorcycle used by the gunman in fleeing after the killing.Obusan said the Nissan Sentra was burned and “chopped up” for parts after Nilo’s killing. Those found involved in the destruction of evidence were taken in as suspects, he said.Under police custody are Garcia, who surrendered following Mallari’s arrest, and another suspect identified as Marius Torres Albis, who surrendered on Sunday evening, Corpus said.Still being pursued, he said, are the motorcycle’s driver, Allan F. Maniacop, the motorcycle owner identified as Michael Ocampo, and the riders of another motorcycle believed to have been used to case the chapel, identified as Bernie M. Limpio and Rolly D. Sigua.“Why did Mallari confess? Because of the physical evidence that was the car. He couldn’t deny anymore. You can’t overturn physical evidence,” Obusan said.Corpus said the investigation was still going on, with other suspects being pursued and investigators looking at possible motives for the attack on Nilo other than Torres’ grudge.Other motives“We are looking at that lead as of now, but again, it’s not yet safe to say that other possibilities are ruled out. The investigation will look at other suspects to get a better idea of the motive,” Corpus said.For one thing, he said, the gun used to kill the priest was “involved” in the killing of a bus driver and a conductor in May also in Nueva Ecija.Albayalde described the arrests as a “commendable act of the Philippine National Police” despite the authorities’ blunder involving Adell Roll Milan.Milan was arrested and identified as the gunman on June 14.But following the identification and arrest of Mallari, the case against Milan was withdrawn and he was ordered released by a Cabanatuan court on June 29.",1
"President Benigno Aquino III does not think there is a resurgence of public support for the family of the late President Ferdinand Marcos following the announcement of the vice presidential run of the former dictator’s son and namesake, Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.“There is a resurgence of support? No, no. I think the answer to that is very obvious. I don’t think so,” the President on Tuesday said at the media forum hosted by the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines at a hotel in Pasay City.The vice presidency that Bongbong Marcos is seeking in the May 2016 elections is a step toward the bigger goal of the presidency in 2022, according to analysts.His mother, Imelda, is seeking a third term as a member of the House of Representatives, while his sister, Imee, wants to be reelected as governor of Ilocos Norte province.With a field of six major vice presidential candidates, including five from the Bicol region, supporters of Bongbong Marcos hope that the so-called Solid North (the bailiwick of the elder Marcos) and Eastern Visayas (the region of Imelda) would deliver the votes to make him win.Mr. Aquino, the son of the assassinated prodemocracy senator Ninoy Aquino and opposition leader Corazon Aquino who was swept to the presidency after Marcos was toppled by a popular revolt, expressed doubts over a possible return of the Marcoses to power.“I have faith in my bosses, the Filipino people. There is nothing that has caused me to change the faith that they are able to discern,” he said.The President evaded a question on the identity of the mastermind of the 1983 assassination of his father, Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr.“The bottom line is there was a mode of governance existing in our country then that allowed such a thing to happen,” he said. “And who was the principal author of that mode of governance in turning us into a dictatorship?”Asked if he thinks the Marcoses should apologize for the horrors of martial law, Mr. Aquino said: “Yes.”READ: Aquino: Marcos children should apologize to Filipinos“If there is a denial of what happened, is that also a statement that there is no recognition that things have to be corrected down the line? And therefore, is there a promise that there will be a repetition of the sin? Those are the questions,” he said.But Bongbong Marcos, a Nacionalista Party senator, said there was nothing he should apologize for.Malacañang earlier urged the citizenry to stay vigilant, saying “never again” to dictatorship as the nation marked the 43rd anniversary of Marcos’ proclamation of martial law.Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. noted that “because it was 43 years ago, because a generation is 25 years, the two generations born since then don’t have even the slightest experience and hadn’t witnessed what we had.”“So the young generation should understand and we are there with them saying ‘never again’ and should not repeat the tragic experience of the Philippines under martial law,” Coloma said.The government has documented more than 75,000 cases of torture, illegal detention and disappearances during the Marcos regime.The Marcoses were also charged with amassing billions of pesos in hidden wealth.The Palace hit back at the Marcos scion for making “sweeping remarks without the benefit of tangible proof” against the Aquino administration when he announced his vice presidential candidacy in Intramuros, Manila.Coloma said that “as he seeks the vice presidency, Senator Marcos may do well to explain how his own brand of governance will be different from the 21-year authoritarian regime of his father.”He called the Marcos regime the “darkest chapter in the country’s history.”RELATED STORIESAquino laughs off claims on ‘resurgence’ of support for MarcosesTo young Filipinos who never knew martial law and dictatorshipRegime of lies",1
"all for corrective eye treatment and surgical procedures.“Now that we have our own Eye Center, we no longer have to refer Makatizens to other hospitals or institutions for special procedures or treatment. I personally don’t want them to feel displaced and burden them with additional expenses,” Binay, a lawyer and daughter of former Vice President Jejomar C. Binay said.The younger Binay stated that the OsMak Eye Center is aimed at providing the best ophthalmic care adapted to the needs of Makati residents as the facility can accommodate about 100 patients per day, covering a wide range of eye conditions and services such as cataract, glaucoma and laser surgery, diabetic retinopathy, among others.Associate Chief Resident Dr. Yuoko Sakurai, of the Department of Ophthalmology, explained that the additional equipment will allow them to treat more patients in-house.She bared that with the establishment of the new eye center, they would no longer have to send out patients who need laser procedures as well as visual field tests unlike before.Binay assured the public that the Eye Center has skilled surgeons, consultants, and residents from the Department of Ophthalmology.Aside from the services mentioned above, Yellow Card holders can also go to the Eye Center for Refraction, Biometry, Optical Coherence Tomography, Fundus Photography, Fluorescein Angiography, Visual Fields/Humphrey Perimetry and Ocular Ultrasonography: B-scan, she added.The Department of Ophthalmology was first formed in 1988. Ospital ng Makati, on the other hand, is an ISO-certified tertiary hospital and serves as one of the pillars of the Makati Health Program.",1
"CASE CLOSED. This is according to Department of Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana after they have finally captured the men behind the bloody bombing in Davao City. The suspects were nabbed in Cotabato City on Friday.According to Lorenzana that they have recovered bombing paraphernalia and cellphone which has a video of the actual bombing.In the video, the suspect was heard shouting “Allahu Akbar” while people are seen running around shouting for help.The suspects are identified as TJ Tagadaya Makabalang, Wendel Facturan, and Musalli Mustapha. The three are members of the Maute Group, a terrorist group that has a close link with the Abu Sayyaf Group.Lorenzana said that the bombing was made in retaliation with the heavy forces sent by the government in Sulu to combat Abu Sayyaf.Meanwhile, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte commended the success of the operation but warned the dabawenyos to remain vigilant.The Davao blast left 15 dead and 69 injured.Any words on this?

"The United States will continue to support the Philippine military’s anti-terror operations, especially after the bombing in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat, that killed three people and hurt 37 others.“At the request of the government of the Philippines, US special operations forces continue to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in Mindanao through support that increases intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,” said Molly Koscina, US Embassy spokesperson.Military operationsKoscina did not specify what support the Philippines could expect, but during the five-month siege of Marawi last year, Filipino troops apparently received drone and satellite intelligence from the United States.The military tagged two groups of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) as being behind the deadly attack that killed three people and wounded dozens of others in Isulan on Tuesday night.Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of the 6th Infantry Division, said one of the groups was led by a certain Ismael, alias Bungos, who operated in the Maguindanao area.Sobejana declined to fully identify the two suspected BIFF leaders because of ongoing manhunt operations.“We’re trying our best to capture them to give justice to the victims,” Sobejana added.The Isulan bombing was the second terror incident claimed by local Islamic State affiliates after the suicide bombing last month that left 11 people dead in southern Basilan.The Special Investigation Task Group Hamungaya released a sketch of the Isulan bomber in Cotabato City.ManhuntChief Supt. Eliseo Tam Rasco, Cotabato regional police director, presented the computer-generated facial sketch of the bomber who eluded arrest shortly before the 8:30 p.m. bomb attack on Tuesday.Rasco described the suspect as being 20-25 years old, about 5’6” tall, of medium build and weighing about 60 kilograms, and of fair complexion.The blast came while Isulan was on the second day of celebrating its foundation day and its Hamungaya Festival.Supt. Aldrin Gonzales, Cotabato regional police spokesperson, noted another computer-generated sketch of the suspect circulated on social media the day after the bombing, but that was a fake.“That was done by somebody who wanted to muddle the investigation,” Gonzales told the Inquirer.",1
"Pope Francis denounced in prepared speeches for delivery on Saturday “so many tragic signs of evil” in the relief and recovery efforts mounted in the wake of the most devastating typhoon to hit the Philippines in 2003.But surrounded by gut-wrenching reminders of Supertyphoon “Yolanda,” the Pope disregarded the speeches condemning corruption to speak from the heart. The Vatican press office later lifted the embargo on the speeches and told reporters they could be published.In the text of his homily during the Mass for the survivors at the Tacloban airport, the Pope said the victims of the typhoon, internationally called “Haiyan,” were beneficiaries of the “generosity of so many people and so many small miracles of goodness.”“But you have also seen, in the profiteering, the looting and the failed responses to this great human drama, so many tragic signs of the evil from which Christ came to save us,” he said.“Let us pray that this, too, will lead us to greater trust in the power of God’s grace to overcome sin and selfishness. Let us pray in particular that it will make everyone more sensitive to the cry of our brothers and sisters in need. Let us pray that it will lead to a rejection of all forms of injustice and corruption, which, by stealing from the poor, poison the very roots of society.”Fair treatmentIn his prepared address for the clergy and religious at the Palo Cathedral, the Pope urged fair treatment especially of the poor.“I asked that the poor of this country be treated fairly—that their dignity be respected, that political and economic policies be just and inclusive, that opportunities for employment and education be developed, and that obstacles to the delivery of social services be removed,” he said.“Our treatment of the poor is the criterion on which each of us will be judged,” he added.Yolanda left more than 6,300 people dead and 1,000 missing. About 1.5 million families were affected while over 910,000 families were displaced.The Aquino administration has allotted P167.9 billion in the national budget for the next two years to finance the recovery and rehabilitation plan for 171 cities and municipalities in 44 provinces in six regions affected by Yolanda.Of that budget, P75.7 billion has been allotted for resettlement, P35.1 billion for infrastructure, P30.6 billion for livelihood and P26.4 billion for social services.As of November, the government has released about P52 billion to support government relief and rehabilitation efforts in the provinces affected by the supertyphoon.Foreign aid pledged to the recovery effort totaled P73.3 billion, while foreign aid received by government and nongovernment organizations totaled P17.2 billion, according to the latest report posted on Foreign Aid Transparency Hub website.‘Not practical’In December, former Sen. Panfilo Lacson tendered his irrevocable resignation as rehabilitation czar, saying it was “not practical to create ad hoc bodies” like the Office of the Presidential Assistant on Rehabilitation and Recovery but instead allow another government agency to do the job permanently.Lacson’s resignation will take effect on Feb. 10 after his office completes the transfer of reconstruction-related tasks to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.

"Disaster officials and local chief executives in four municipalities of Albay convened on Tuesday morning to come up with necessary interventions plan to mitigate the impact of possible lahar flow in the coming days.The meeting was part of the proposal of Presidential Adviser on Political Affairs and Mayon Eruption Crisis manager Secretary Francis Tolentino to create a task force for anti-lahar intervention.The idea came up when Phivolcs volcanologist Paul Alanis reported during the Mayon Crisis briefing held at Camp General Simeon Ola, that Mayon has spewed at least 90 million cubic meters composed of pyroclastic density currents (PDC) or locally known as “uson,” ash falls and lava, while 37 percent of it were loose materials that can be carried away by floods when 20 millimeter to 25 millimeter rainfall per hour hit the province.According to Tolentino, municipalities mostly affected were towns of Daraga, Camalig, Sto. Domingo, and Guinobatan.He said the government has to come up with the necessary intervention to the possible impact of lahar flow.“Ngayon pa lang dapat na nating paghandaan ito. So nagmi-meeting sila para sa plano. Kung ilan yung mga dapat na i-evacuate para sa funding.

"IF THE COURT upholds the “impossible” requirement for a foundling to prove his unknown parentage, generations of Filipino foundlings will suffer the unintended consequences.Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno had this to say in her 20-minute interpellation of Alexander Poblador, counsel of presidential candidate Grace Poe, a foundling now facing challenges to the status of her citizenship and qualification for public office as the senator fights to remain in the running for the nation’s top post.Sereno Tuesday underscored the magnitude of any decision the high court would make on Poe’s challenge to her disqualification, saying generations of foundlings would be affected by how the court would rule on the case.Sereno zeroed in on who should carry the burden of proof that Poe is not a natural-born Filipino and hence not qualified to seek public office—the reason the Commission on Elections (Comelec) had voted to disqualify her from the May presidential election.For Sereno, compelling a foundling to prove his or her unknown parentage was an “impossible condition,” and that upholding such a requirement would betray the presumption in Philippine adoption laws that a foundling is a Filipino.“We have to be careful that we’re not held by a rigid reading of what we consider as a failure to enumerate foundlings. We are going to create unintended consequences, the difficulties of which are not only going to be visited on your client but on so many foundlings in this country,” said Sereno, the last justice to ask Poblador questions in three-hour oral arguments Tuesday.Profound implication“The implication is very profound, not only for your client. I would put a blinder on who your client is and just focus on the implication on foundling rights, who are being required by the position of petitioners to prove an impossible condition,” Sereno said.She sought to establish how the country’s laws on domestic and international adoption carried the presumption that foundlings in the Philippines were in fact Filipinos, hence Philippine courts had jurisdiction over them.By mere title, she noted that Republic Act No. 8552 is called “An act establishing rules and policies on the domestic adoption of Filipino Children, and for other purposes.”“Meaning foundlings are covered by rules on the adoption of Filipino children,” Sereno said.Republic Act No. 8043 is titled “An act establishing the rules to govern intercountry adoption of Filipino children and for other purposes,” and also spells out rules on the intercountry adoption of foundlings in the Philippines.“The legislature itself accords foundlings the presumption of citizenship,” Poblador said.Under the country’s adoption laws and the civil code, Poblador said, “no court can assume jurisdiction of the foundling if foundling is not presumed Filipino.”Sereno said that while the law may at times be “silent, obscure or ambiguous,” courts were tasked to issue rulings based on legislative interpretation so that justice would be upheld.“The law intends for justice and right to prevail. So the point of us making sure that justice prevails is not a vox populi requirement. I disagree with that. It is a duty which justices are required to observe because it is even statutorily required of us in keeping with our mandate under the civil code and inherent functions we are exercising as a court,” Sereno said.“I’m very interested because there are parents now who want to adopt. What this court is going to say will speak to them… Whether we find it strictly by saying that the language is silent—so the right of foundlings is completely silent—or will resort to interpretation, not only statutory construction, but judicial interpretation, and administrative practices in order that a just and right ruling will result,” Sereno said.After three hours, the court adjourned until the next hearing, set on Tuesday.Enough evidenceAssociate Justice Marvic Leonen, picking off where he left during the first hearing on Tuesday last week questioning Poblador, reiterated that those seeking the senator’s disqualification never presented any evidence that she was a foreigner, and thus she was presumed a natural-born Filipino eligible to seek the presidency.Leonen questioned whether evidence was presented in the Comelec enough to prove that Poe was a natural-born Filipino citizen, considering that the proceedings at the poll body were summary in nature, meaning there were no hearings.Poblador admitted that Poe’s foundling certificate and decree of adoption were not enough to prove that one of the senator’s parents were Filipinos.The lawyer, however, reiterated Poe’s position that she is natural-born based on presumptions under both domestic and international laws, to which Leonen replied, “Maybe to some of us it is too iffy, too ambiguous, too tenuous a link.”The justice also asked Poblador to discuss in the memorandum to be submitted to the court on whether a foundling can be given a natural-born Filipino citizenship just because the foundling was found on Philippine territory.On the residency issue, Poblador said the senator lived in the Philippines since birth, except for some 14 years when she was in the United States.He also agreed with Leonen that the constitutional provision requiring a 10-year residency “immediately preceding the election” for presidential candidates did not say that the 10 years must be continuous.Question of loyaltyThe justice said that if the purpose of the 10-year residency rule was for the candidate to be familiar with the conditions in the country, then there may not be a reason for Poe not to be so since she lived most of her life in the Philippines and that because of technology such as the Internet, she could have been familiar with what is happening in the country.Leonen also challenged the premise that the reason for imposing a natural-born citizenship requirement on candidates for President was to assure their loyalty to the country, asking if there ever was a scientific finding proving that non-natural-borns are not or less loyal.He pointed out that a child born in Hawaii of parents who are Philippine citizens could theoretically run for president of the United States, although it would be up to American voters to decide to vote for the child when he runs for the office in the future.Justices Antonio Carpio and Teresita Leonardo-De Castro focused on Poblador’s citation of international law in declaring that foundlings like Poe had the right to be citizens of the country where they are found.Carpio pointed out that the 1930 Hague Convention cited by Poblador could not have been construed as international law applicable in the Philippines at the time the 1935 Constitution was enacted, saying that the convention only took effect in 1937 when the required 10 states ratified it.Incremental actsCarpio asked if Poblador could submit the income tax returns submitted by Poe in 2005 and 2006 while De Castro asked the lawyer to submit to the court the basis used by the Bureau of Immigration in declaring Poe as a natural-born citizen.Justice Presbitero Velasco asked Poblador on the lawyer’s assertion that Poe’s decision to reestablish her residency in the Philippines was a “series of incremental acts.”“Relocation is difficult. There are steps which must taken in totality,” adding that the elements of reacquisition of domicile—physical presence, intent to stay and no intention to return to previous residence were all present in Poe’s case.Justice Mariano del Castillo, on the other hand, asked Poblador about his position that it should be up to the people to decide Poe’s qualifications in the election.“You say vox populi vox dei [but] isn’t the Constitution also the voice of the people?” he asked, to which Poblador said the Constitution provided elections in which the people could continue to make their decisions.",1

"The Christian fundamentalist group American Family Association (AFA) has again reared it ugly anti-gay head by calling for a boycott of Coca-Cola.Earlier the group urged its members not to accept mail that is postmarked with the Harvey Milk stamp, saying that the late first openly-gay elected politician fom San Francisco does not deserve to be memorialized in a postage stamp.Today, the AFA called on its members and the consuming public to stop buying Coke products, or if they absolutely need to drink soda, to buy Pepsi instead.It’s all about Coke’s extremely popular summer marketing campaign in which coke bottles are personalized with common names of people like Jane, Chris or Paul.Well, it has come to the attention of AFA that Coca-Cola has been producing a lot of coke bottles with the names Adam and Steve.

"Lawmakers have thumbed down a plan of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to scrap the suggested retail price (SRP) for basic goods as provided by the Price Act.Congressmen Ariel Casilao of Anakpawis party-list and Ben Evardone of Eastern Samar on Thursday said the setting of the SRP should be a company decision.DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez had said that the market should set the SRP.“Amid the indigent state of the people, scrapping the SRP or liberalizing prices is another encumbrance and will definitely make the already poor poorer, who could not even afford the most basic of the basic goods such as food,” Casilao said in a statementCasilao identified the basic goods as rice, meat, fish, vegetables; manufactured goods such as canned fish, milk, coffee, detergent, bread, firewood and charcoal; essential drugs; and household fuel like liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene.“It is apparent that the officials in the Duterte administration do not believe that majority of the people are already in abject poverty and misery, and that demand is generally always higher than supply as the country lacks industries, and for this very reason, prices are raring to go the peakest as possible,” he said.“With no significant wage hike and continuing contractualization of labor, worsening landlessness and displacement on farmers, price hikes on basic goods or its consequential food insecurity will only lead to more political instability in the country. It’s as if the government is pushing the people to resort to unrest due to economic reasons,” Casilao added.Evardone agreed, saying that scrapping SRPs would allow businessmen to collect profits at unprecedented rate.“It is simply anti-poor. Instead of promoting competition, the removal of SRP will be used as a tool to increase the prices of basic goods,” Evardone said also in a statement.",1

"The 55,000 tobacco farmers in the country fear for the worst once the country’s leading cigarette manufacturer closes down for good.In an interview, Mario Cabasal, president of the National Federation of Tobacco Farmers Association and Cooperatives (NAFTAC), said the prices of tobacco products have gone down after the closure of Mighty Corp.“Most of our products we called low grades and rejects are being bought by Mighty and they offer high prices for it. Other buyers offer low prices, so we’ll go bankrupt,” Cabasal said.Cabasal said “those who are directly and indirectly employed by Mighty Corp. are worried after Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Caesar R. Dulay threatened to cancel Mighty’s manufacturing permit not later than next month.”The BIR filed a R9.5-billion tax evasion case against Mighty Corp. before the Department of Justice on April 20.The case was filed following the discovery of billions of pesos worth of Mighty cigarette brands bearing fake tax stamps.The Bureau of Customs and the BIR seized during the past two months big volumes of cigarettes with fake tax stamps in Zamboanga City, Pampanga, General Santos City, Cebu City, and Tacloban City.The NAFTAC is urging the government to consider the consequences if Mighty Corp. is completely shut down.“There is a human side to all of this,” Cabasal said. “There are 300,000 Filipinos whose lives depend on the production of our members. If Mighty’s operations are shut down, what will happen to our 55,000 tobacco farmers?”",1
"Malacañang on Wednesday described The New York Times’ profile of President Rodrigo Duterte as a “well-paid hack job,” and blasted it for linking his rise to power to violence.Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said in a statement that the New York Times appeared to be dealing with facts selectively in order to “bully” Mr. Duterte.“One would expect more from the New York Times. Their article, ‘Becoming Duterte: The making of a Philippine strongman,’ sounds like a well-paid hack job for well-heeled clients with shady motives,” Abella said.He objected to the article’s use of violence to frame the rise to power of Mr. Duterte—who has repeatedly threatened to kill criminals and drug peddlers—and said it ignored his other achievements.Mayor’s initiatives“NYT cynically and unfairly narrates the President’s rise to power in the context of violence. It deliberately fails to mention the many initiatives the President made when he was Davao City mayor,” he said.He pointed out that with Mr. Duterte as its long-term mayor, Davao City had been praised as one of the safest cities in the world.Residents followed an antismoking and a midnight alcohol ban, and city services were efficient, he noted.“Moreover, Mr. Duterte ensured that Davao City Hall is a responsive government known for its efficient delivery of government services,” he said.On Mr. Duterte’s watch, Davao City got a one-stop shop for business permits, a Central Communication and Emergency Response Center that provides emergency resources to residents, a Lingap Para sa Mahirap health financial assistance program, free primary and secondary education in public institutions and access to college education for underprivileged but deserving students, he said.Best of intentionsWhile Mr. Duterte shuns “Western liberal niceties” and has a rough manner, he only has the best of intentions for the nation, Abella said.Mr. Duterte wants to reduce crime and poverty, and bring about peace, he said.“[The President] does not engage in Western liberal niceties to promote his agenda, to rebuild a nation with compromised internal structures,” he said.‘Rough-hewn outsider’“He is a rough-hewn outsider who vowed to ‘reduce poverty; restore trust in the government by addressing crime, corruption and illegal drugs; and reinforce peace agreements with ethnic Moros who experienced historic injustice, and the CPP/NPA/NDFP who have been fighting for social justice for decades,’” he added.The New York Times article failed to present the whole picture of the President, he said.“One gets the feeling NYT is not interested in presenting the whole truth, only that with which they can bully those who attempt an independent foreign policy,” he said.",1

"The House of Representatives was just doing its job when it processed the impeachment complaints against officials seen to be critical of President Rodrigo Duterte, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said on Friday amid criticisms that the chamber was targetting opposition voices.“Wait a minute. These impeachment complaints don’t emanate from us. It was filed by a Filipino citizen. Under the Constitution, we are mandated to process any impeachment complaint,” Alvarez told a press conference in Makati City.“We cannot just ignore them,” he added.The latest impeachment complaint was filed by lawyer Larry Gadon against Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno.“We hope the impeachment process will not be abused,” Vice President Leni Robredo said Thursday when asked about the impeachment case against Sereno.“Impeachment is one of the processes in a democracy, so let us listen. But in my view, it should not be used to incite fear. It should not be used to punish people who are boldly making their voices heard against the government,” said Robredo, who was herself the subject of an impeachment complaint that however failed to get any endorsement from a House member.Aside from Sereno and Robredo, an impeachment complaint had also been filed against Commission on Elections chair Andres Bautista while Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales had been threatened with impeachment.“When someone files an impeachment complaint, what are we supposed to do?” Alvarez said. “It’s not like we can just ignore it.”He added: “Now if people are complaining, that’s just PR (public relations) work. They are trying to give it another angle…They muddle the issue,” he said.The Speaker compared the criticisms against the House to the controversy hounding the Bureau of Customs.“In the beginning we wanted to investigate the [P6.4 billion] drug shipment but they tried to divert it to other issues,” Alvarez said, alluding to his run-in with former Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon’s chief of staff Mandy Anderson, who accused him of influence-peddling.“But the House did not allow itself to be distracted,” he said.“We continued and finished the investigation. We had recommendations in a committee report. And from there, the truth came out. That is what will happen as well (in the impeachment cases),” Alvarez said.",1

Re-exam (real examinations) afterwards. Those who cannot pass, no driver's license, even if it means loss of livelihood.Remove the jeepney and tricycles at least on major arteries.

"New Customs Commissioner Alberto Lina is facing another conflict-of-interest issue, this time for ordering the release of broadcasting equipment belonging to GMA Network Inc. that had been ordered held by his predecessor, John Phillip Sevilla, for relying on “false” import permits from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC).In an April 28 memo, a copy of which was obtained by the Inquirer, Lina ordered the lifting of the Bureau of Customs (BOC)-issued alert order on the shipment that was handled by 2100 Customs Brokerage or 2100 CB—one of his companies.The shipment—covered by airway bill Nos. INN 40462871, UCH 00909591, UCH 00909565 and MUC 81410098 and stored in the Pasay City warehouse of U-Freight, another Lina-owned company—was placed under BOC investigation in late November by the bureau’s Intelligence Group, citing violations of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines.In his directive, Lina cited the recommendation of the bureau’s law division and its revenue collection office at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport that “it would be highly improbable for GMA, a company well-known internationally for its credible reputation, to allow this illegal act as this would utterly and unnecessarily ruin its good name.”Expired permitsOn Dec. 1, 2014, Exequiel Cempron, director of the bureau’s Collection Service, reported to Sevilla that “the NTC import permits that were submitted to the Department of Finance and endorsed to the Collection Service regarding the [GMA Network] importations were discovered to be false.”In another report to Sevilla and Deputy Commissioner Ma. Edita Tan, Cempron said four of seven NTC permits submitted by the network had not only expired but also had “different issuance and expiry dates,” indicating that they were fake.Cempron also disclosed that during his meeting with lawyer Ferdinand Nague, 2100 CB president, the latter admitted that a certain Jason de Ramos, a representative of Dexter Pepanio, their licensed customs broker, had “submitted false import permits” covering the GMA 7 shipment.Cempron’s discovery and Nague’s admission that the NTC permits were fake were later confirmed by NTC Deputy Commissioner Delilah Deles.With the submission of fake import permits, the shipment could not be accorded the tax and duty-free privilege given to media equipment and was slapped full customs duties and taxes.At this writing, Lina had yet to respond to the Inquirer’s request for an interview and comment on the issue.For its part, GMA Network said the company “was not at fault” and “will never condone any illegal act.”In a statement, it noted that “it is unfortunate that GMA Network is being drawn into certain issues against the Bureau of Customs due to our importation of broadcast equipment that are now being held by the BOC.”GMA 7 ‘fully complied’The firm said it “fully complied with all the requirements pertaining to the importation of the equipment which are necessary for upgrading our facilities.”“The discontinuance of customs processing for the release of the equipment issued by the BOC was caused by the alleged infractions committed by an employee of our broker, 2100 CB. GMA had absolutely nothing to do with the alleged irregularities. The said employee has since been dismissed by 2100 CB and GMA has stopped engaging the services of 2100 CB for our new importations since the time the irregularities were discovered,” the network said.In absolving GMA 7, the BOC law division said “the manner by which the NTC import permits were brought about should not be unfairly imputed against GMA Network precisely because the latter did not authorize Jason de Ramos, a mere representative of the customs broker, to do so.”“What was done by De Ramos was an ultra vies act (an act beyond the authority of a corporation to perform) and this should not bind GMA Network. It would be highly improbable for GMA, a company well-known internationally for its credible reputation, to allow this illegal act as this would utterly and unnecessarily ruin its good name. Thus, the resulting consequence of such an act should be borne by Ramos alone,” it said.It added: “The act may be due to the overzealousness of Ramos to swiftly process the release of the shipment.

Gilbert DC Cruz said the intensified campaign against illegal logging and illegal fishing is his top priority as the new regional director of the police force in Leyte and Samar.Cruz said the campaign against illegal logging and illegal fishing is in support of the campaign of the national government to help preserve the environment.From October 5 to 8, various police stations in the region conducted 69 anti-illegal logging operations which resulted in the arrest of 12 individuals and confiscation of P758,224 worth of illegally- cut lumber and two chainsaws, Cruz said.In the campaign against illegal fishing, 47 operations were conducted, and resulted in the arrest of 80 fishermen and confiscation of 14 fine mesh nets, two active gear compressors and 32 fishing boats.Cruz said criminal charges have been filed by the various police stations against the arrested individuals.",1
"The European Union (EU) will “survive” Britain’s Brexit departure and will remain strong, the bloc’s foreign policy chief said Wednesday.“Many believed that the referendum in the United Kingdom (on leaving the EU) was going to be the beginning of the end of the European Union,” Federica Mogherini said during a two-day visit to Cuba.“I’m very positive on the fact that the Union is not only going to survive, but it’s going to go deeper,” Mogherini said.“The world needs the European Union to stay strong, and so, this is what are we are going to do,” she said.Britons voted 52 to 48 percent in June, 2016 in favor of quitting the EU, putting their country on track to become the first to leave the bloc.Britain began what is expected to be two years of difficult divorce negotiations with a formal notification by letter to the EU president in March, 2017.The talks between London and Brussels are set to move on to transition arrangements, trade and security as Britain prepares to leave the European Union in March, 2019.",1
"It’s that time of year when The Adobo Chronicles names its “Person of the Year.” Last year, we named actor Jackie Chan our person of the year for having survived persistent news that he had passed away. Talk about nine lives.This year, the publisher and editors of The Adobo Chronicles had a fairly easy job of choosing the winner: Philippine Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas.The “Person of the Year” is awarded to the individual or group that has made the most impact on national and international news. We couldn’t have chosen any other person who has been in the news as much as Roxas has.During the aftermath of the worst typhoon to hit the Philippines, Roxas was seen in ground zero overseeing relief operations and giving aid to residents except those who were loyal to his and President Aquino’s political nemesis, the Romualdezes. When there was a shortage of garlic in the Philippines, he was seen carrying a sack of garlic on his shoulder. When there was rumor about a rice shortage, he was seen carrying a sack of goverment rice on his shoulder. When Metro Manila experienced the worst traffic nightmare ever, he was seen directing traffic in one of Manila’s most congested street intersections. When Metro Manila’s light railway system (MRT) was the subject of intense criticism for its overcrowding, inefficiency and mismagement, Roxas was seen riding the train on non-commute hours.We couldn’t think of a better person deserving of the Person of the Year title. It was a great 2014 for Mar Roxas and the Philippines.And Roxas could just well be the next president of the Philippines! It comes with a bonus: controversial television news anchor Korina Sanchez will be First Lady.",0
"The man who allegedly orchestrated a P900-million pyramiding scam, which he passed off as a Bitcoin investment scheme, was so honey-tongued that he had to be kept in isolation until formal charges were filed against him and his wife.Even their custodians at the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) of the Philippine National Police were ordered not to speak to suspected con artist Arnel Ordonio, operator of New G Bitcoin Investment Trading.He was arrested along with his wife, Leonady, in an entrapment operation on Wednesday last week in Ilocos Sur.Promise of money“While he (Arnel) was in custody, he was overheard promising someone that as soon as he gets out, he would bring out the money,” the PNP-CIDG chief, Director Roel Obusan, said in a press conference at Camp Crame in Quezon City on Tuesday.“We could not allow that,” Obusan said.He said he had ordered his men to avoid speaking to Ordonio because he was afraid the suspect could sweet-talk his way out of custody.“So I waited for the charges to be filed against them before giving any clearance for anyone to speak with him,” said the PNP official.Even one of the female victims was convinced that once Ordonio was released, he could return the money she had invested.“We know Arnel,” former overseas worker Jocelyn Estolas said. “He returns the money even in installments. We can no longer recover our money now that he is here [in police custody].”Estolas claimed that the “uplines” (investor recruiters) were being threatened by the people they had persuaded to invest.Another victim, however, blamed Ordonio for her woes.“We already spoke with Arnel and he did not do anything to return our investments. It had to end up here where we and he are in deep trouble,” Irish Batangan said. “He is no longer in any position to return our money.”EntrapmentThe complaint filed in the CIDG’s Anti-Organized Crime Unit (AOCU) by 48 victims resulted in the Ordonio couple’s arrest on April 4 in an entrapment operation on Calle Crisologo in Vigan City.Obusan said the couple had asked for P2 million from one of their alleged victims purportedly to process the withdrawal of their bitcoin trading investment from coins.ph.com. The Ordonios claimed they had encountered problems with the website.The AOCU set up the entrapment operation for the meeting where the victim promised to give the couple P50,000.Recovered from the suspects were a laptop and a mobile phone believed to have been used by the duo for their illegal activities.30-percent returnAccording to Obusan, the Ordonio couple allegedly lured people to invest in their online business, which trades in Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, promising a 30-percent return on investment with payouts every 15 days.“When you browse YouTube and see this couple, they have a video where they are throwing away bundles of P500 from the second story of their home. That’s how they present themselves as earning so much by way of Bitcoin,” the PNP-CIDG director said.“But he (Ordonio) is not connected to Bitcoin,” he added.He said the couple was simply involved in a pyramiding scam that used Bitcoin as a lure.At the press conference, several of the victims spoke to reporters, most of them expressing high hopes of recovering some of the money they had invested.Rosanne Maglunog said she and her husband were invited by a friend to invest in New G until they went on to encourage their relatives to put in money that totaled P29 million in November and December last year.She and her husband put in P4 million.Investment optionsMaglunog said she and her husband were given two investment options: P90,000 and P160,000. If an investor could not get “downlines” (other invited investors), his personal money could be invested.For a P90,000 investment, there was a P15,000 payout every 15 days, which Arnel said he could no longer make.Maglunog said she had a hunch last December that she and her husband were being scammed when the Ordonios posted on social media that they could no longer issue a payout to investors.The victim said that when she and her husband got in touch with Ordonio on Facebook on Feb. 28, he promised to give them P3 million every five days so they could recover their capital. Ordonio did not keep the promise.This prompted Maglunog and her husband to seek the help of the Malolos City police, which referred them to the PNP-CIDG.Syndicated estafaThe Ordonio couple was charged with estafa/swindling and syndicated estafa in the Department of Justice. They remain in the custody of the PNP-CIDG.PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa advised the public not to fall for investment schemes promising huge returns.“If you encounter a scheme that is too good to be true—offering a huge interest rate—that’s a scam. Don’t be fooled,” he said.Dela Rosa admitted that he himself was a victim of a scam.",1
"Love on Valentine’s Day can be translated into love for country, and can be shown in the little things that we do everyday.This was the lesson learned by schoolchildren who joined the Inquirer’s Read-Along session on Saturday, whose theme was #ReadAlong4LoveofCountry.Love of country is seen in how you live your daily life, actress Agot Isidro told the children.“You have to practice it in the smallest of ways … From following traffic signs, crossing the streets in designated areas, helping in household chores. All these things will manifest later on into bigger things as you grow older,” she said.Love for others, meanwhile, became the dominant theme in the tales of selflessness and humility that storytellers Isidro, TV personality Gabby Padilla and veteran storyteller Ann Abacan, principal of Sophia School in Meycauayan City, Bulacan, told some 100 children during the event.The session also included a simple turnover of Philippine flags led by Ayala Foundation president Ruel Maranan to over 30 schools in Metro Manila and Bulacan province as part of its “Maging Magiting” campaign.Isidro read Rene Villanueva’s “Ang Alamat ng Papaya,” about the kindhearted Reyna Lingap and her loyal Pya-a followers who protected her from pirates.‘Symbiotic’“The Pya-a people, who were once oppressed, became the courageous ones who fought for their leader and their country. They were empowered because of the goodness of their leader. It’s very symbiotic,” Isidro said of her favorite part of the story.As for her, Isidro said she showed love for country by excelling in her craft, hoping that this would have a ripple effect.“If you do good in your work, then you get recognized. And the community around you will see you as an example,” the actress added.Padilla, meanwhile, read another Villanueva story, “Ang Dalawang Haring Siga,” which tells of two rival chieftains who eventually settle their differences after their grandchildren become best friends.Abacan read “Si Diwayen, Noong Bago Dumating ang mga Espanyol” by Augie Rivera. The story tells how Diwayen, a young slave, earns her freedom after saving a young princess from danger in the woods.“Most of the time, wisdom comes from older people. But once in a while, the younger generation know what they’re talking about. They are the voice of the future,” Padilla said.Flag recipientsAbacan, who is also an officer of Meycauayan City Private Schools Association, received the flags for Sophia School and in behalf of 30 public schools in the city.The other flag recipients were Romelyn Cabugsa of Centex Manila, Ma. Lourdes and Reynaldo Chua of Good Shepherd Montessori School, and Mary Grace Sumalinog of San Antonio Elementary School.Maranan said they would distribute thousands of Philippine flags in schools nationwide as it was important for children to be aware of what the national flag symbolized.“Every time you see our flag, may it inspire you not just to get high grades in school and make your parents proud, or even strive hard to be the person you want to be, but most importantly, to serve our country,” he added.The flag donation project promotes love of country by highlighting the hero in every Filipino.For Niobe, 12, the story that Isidro read taught her to be kind. “We should not do things just because we want to [have our way]. We should be friends with everyone,” he said.Grade 4 student Timothy, 9, said the legend of Papaya taught him to be loyal by being respectful and generous.Teacher Eufronia Natanauan from Good Shepherd Montessori School, meanwhile, expressed appreciation for the read-along session.“Reading is very important because it actually helps students learn even outside the classroom … At the same time, they’re able to apply in their daily life situations all the learning experiences they gain from the stories that they have read,” Natanauan said.Saturday’s session, hosted by Junior Inquirer editor Ruth Navarra-Mayo, was held in cooperation with Cel Amores, senior director for corporate communications of Ayala Foundation.",1
"Police Director Getulio Napeñas was sure of one thing: His men were still alive around noon last Sunday.That was about six hours after the second group of Special Action Force (SAF) commandos got into a gun battle with Moro rebels.The first group, for which the second force was providing cover, had shot its way out of Tukanalipao village in Mamasapano town, Maguindanao province, where it killed Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias “Marwan.”“They were alive, sir, they were alive. Many of them were wounded and they had run out of ammunition,” Napeñas, the sacked SAF commander, quoted PO2 Christopher Lalan as telling him after the clash.Lalan was a member of the second SAF group who survived the gun battle with Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas in Mamasapano. He was the lone survivor.Napeñas told this reporter in an interview on Thursday that the bodies of many of the 44 commandos who were killed in the Mamasapano operation showed that they had been given first aid.Combat casualty care“Their wounds were bandaged, or properly stitched. They had a fighting chance. They held on,” Napeñas said.All the 392 SAF commandos deployed to Mamasapano to get Marwan and local terrorist Abdul Basit Usman had undergone tactical combat casualty care, he said.“They carried individual life savers (ILS). I made sure all of them had ILS,” he added, referring to the emergency kits.The fire fight went on until the commandos ran out of ammunition. It was almost noon.Napeñas said the last contact with the troops, who were pinned down in a cornfield, was before 1 p.m. Help never arrived.Call for reinforcementsThe call for reinforcements went out at 6 a.m. That was when, according to Napeñas, coordination was done not just with the Department of National Defense and the Armed Forces of the Philippines, but also with the government peace panel and the leadership of the MILF.The nearest Philippine Army units that could respond were the Mechanized Brigade in Shariff Aguak town, the 45th Infantry Battalion in Mamasapano and the 601st Infantry Brigade in Awang town.“The most difficult thing was I knew my men were still alive and no reinforcements were coming other than our own forces,” Napeñas said.“It was difficult because I decided not to coordinate prior to our actual jump-off. I knew the Philippine Army in the area was ready to reinforce us at once. But they were also waiting for orders, and I understand that. I do not blame anyone, that’s why I said I was responsible,” he said.Fighting in the afternoonMamasapano Mayor Benzar Ampatuan confirmed to this reporter that IVs (intravenous), bandage and other medical items were found in one area in Tukanalipao where the bodies of the slain commandos were recovered.The area was about 4 to 5 kilometers away from the Pidsandawan village, where Marwan was cornered and killed by the SAF assault team.“We don’t know until what time they lived. We have no way to find out. What we know is that there was still fighting at 3 p.m., when negotiations were going on for the entry of the International Monitoring Team and the local government,” Ampatuan said.“But the fighting was far from the area where we were to retrieve the bodies. We got there about 5:30 p.m.,” he added.In an interview on Tuesday, Napeñas said he was taking full responsibility for what happened in Mamasapano.In that interview, he said his not coordinating the operation with his superiors—Deputy Director General Leonardo Espina, the PNP officer in charge, and Interior Secretary Mar Roxas—delayed the arrival of reinforcements, which cost the lives of his men.But he just followed orders, he said.Who gave the go-signal?This reporter asked him who knew about the Mamasapano operation.Without hesitation he said: “The President, of course, because we had been working on this mission for a long time. As I told you, it was command commitment. We knew how dangerous Marwan was and that was the basis of this operation, to save the lives of the innocent people from the Bin Laden of Southeast Asia.”A senior police official who asked not to be named told this reporter that Napeñas also admitted to Roxas that it was President Aquino who authorized “Oplan Wolverine,” the mission to get Marwan, a bomb expert from the Indonesia-based terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah.“Eventually this will come out and Napeñas owes it to the families of the fallen 44 to admit that he just followed orders because that’s what we do—we follow orders,” the police official said.In his televised address to the nation on Wednesday, President Aquino admitted that he knew about the operation, which was designed under the leadership of Director General Alan Purisima, the suspended PNP chief, based on an “actionable intelligence.”Mr. Aquino, however, did not categorically say that he gave the go-signal for the SAF mission.Intel solid, verifiedThe after-operation report submitted to the President by the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission indicated that the intelligence information on the whereabouts of Marwan came from the SAF.Asked about it, Napeñas said the information came from a “capable” unit.“We just acted on it. The information was solid and verified. We got Marwan,” Napeñas said.Police Director Leocadio Santiago, a former SAF commander, described Napeñas as “dedicated, someone who is both a good subordinate and a leader who cares about the welfare of his men.”“I hope people will see the value of the deaths of the officers and men of the SAF. Those men lost their lives in the line of duty in a dangerous place. Let’s recognize that that place is a battleground and they gave their lives in the performance of their duty,” Santiago said.RELATED STORIES‘There was radio silence, a very long silence’PMA alumni call for ‘impartial’ probe on Mamasapano clashTaliño: Slain SAF men would say it’s (the mission) worth their lives‘Behind every brave SAF trooper is a strong wife’",1
"Philippine government and communist rebel negotiators resumed peace talks here on Thursday, with the insurgents saying they supported President Rodrigo Duterte’s plan for a shift to the federal system but warning that alleged government violations of a human rights accord might prompt them to terminate a monthslong ceasefire.Government officials led by Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. and guerrilla leaders shook hands in a show of unity at a hotel in the Italian capital before resuming the negotiations, which both sides acknowledged would be tough.Special envoy Elisabeth Slattum from Norway, which has been brokering the talks, also attended.The venue was shifted from the Norwegian capital, Oslo, which Philippine officials said would be too cold.Durable negotiated truce“Although there are still unresolved issues, with regard to commitments to releases of political prisoners, commitments on a bilateral ceasefire, which will both be subjects of discussion during the round of talks, we commend the parties for doing exactly that, for working together,” Slattum said.Chief government negotiator Silvestre Bello III said the government panel would seek to turn separate ceasefires declared by President Duterte and the guerrillas in August into a more durable negotiated truce.But his rebel counterpart, Fidel Agcaoili, was less optimistic, saying “the prospect for forging a bilateral ceasefire agreement has grown dim.”Agcaoili said the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the umbrella group of the local communist movement, had raised a number of complaints, including alleged government breaches of a 1998 accord on respecting human rights and another pact on the safety of guerrilla consultants.He said the complaints, including the failure to release nearly 400 detainees the rebels consider political prisoners, made extending a five-month ceasefire “untenable.”The guerrillas also expressed concern over Mr. Duterte’s brutal crackdown on illegal drugs, which has left more than 6,000 suspects dead, and his decision to allow the burial of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos at Libingan ng mga Bayani in November.‘Brutal, reckless’Agcaoili said innocent people had been killed in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs “due to brutal, reckless and indiscriminate methods employed by the police in its antidrug operations.”He said Mr. Duterte should shift his priority to solving the larger problem of poverty through social and economic reforms, which are the main focus of this week’s round of talks.The insurgents have accused the military of violating a ceasefire by occupying schools, village halls and other civilian areas and conducting illegal searches, interrogations and surveillance of suspected rebel supporters.The military has denied the accusations.The rebels said they supported the shift to a federal system, although NDFP consultant Jose Maria Sison, founding chair of the Communist Party of the Philippines, said implementing socioeconomic and political reforms was crucial to their support.“The NDFP is willing to maintain its alliance with the [government] and the Duterte administration in particular by cooperating in the founding of a Federal Republic of the Philippines, the creation of a parliamentary system and the making of a new Constitution,” Sison said, adding that the Rome talks offered an opportunity for the examination of both the strengths and ills of a unitary and federal forms of government.“A federal system of government is not necessarily good or better than [the unitary system], especially when it carries over from an already rotten unitary form of state certain malignancies and does not have constitutional guarantees against the penchant of the oligarchy for puppetry, dictatorship, graft and corruption, dynasty-building and warlordism,” he said.Sison said the negotiators were making headway in the discussions on social and economic reforms.He said the negotiators had already “fleshed out” a “common outline” of social and economic reforms and the two sides could reach agreement on how to accelerate unification of their drafts before they moved to a fourth round of talks.",1
"It was an unwelcome, albeit expected, close encounter with the “25th senator.”Lawyer Jessica Lucila “Gigi” Reyes Thursday confronted this reporter apparently over the mention of her clutching a luxury Goyard handbag and wearing Tory Burch designer shoes when she attended the start of her trial for plunder in the Sandiganbayan on Wednesday.READ article mentioning Gigi Reyes’ Goyard bag: Plunder trial starts for Enrile aide, NapolesReyes, 53, the longtime senior aide of Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, appeared to be looking for me as soon as she was led by her security escorts from the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) out of the courtroom of the Third Division after the three-hour hearing.“Yes? Yes?” an agitated Reyes said repeatedly while this reporter was taking photographs of her.As she was walking down the stairs, Enrile’s former chief of staff handed over her pricey bag to one of the female BJMP personnel as if she was her personal assistant. Reyes was also seen looking for somebody.When Reyes, who was often referred to as the “25th senator” because of the influence she wielded when her 91-year-old boss was the Senate President, noticed me on the other side of the stairs, she immediately walked toward me.One of the jail guards, who was carrying the handbag for her, tried to stop her, but Reyes just shoved her aside.“Yes? Yes?” she again told this reporter, raising her voice as if challenging me to a fistfight.“I’m here. Take a picture,” Reyes said.During the commotion, a man wearing a black polo shirt walked up the stairs asking, “Are you Marlon Ramos?”When I answered in the affirmative, the man went up to me, grabbed my left arm and accosted me about my report that was published on the front page of the Inquirer Thursday.“You even wrote about the bag? Why do you have to include that in your story? You’re from the Inquirer,” the man said in a mix of English and Filipino while holding my left arm.“Yes, exactly, sir. I’m from the Inquirer. Was there something wrong about it? Isn’t it true that she had that bag? Did I lie?” I told the man.He only stopped when one of Reyes’ lawyers, Basco Tagarda, pacified him.The Inquirer later learned from the court security personnel that the man was Reyes’ younger brother, Patrick Jean Gonzales.One of the security staffers of the Sandiganbayan said he did not ask the man to register his name in the logbook because he was an immediate family member of an accused attending trial.Moments before the hearing, I jokingly told one of the justices that I was expecting the article to get on Reyes’ nerves. I told him that Reyes might also confront me.I was right. But I did not expect it to be that brazen.In a country where journalists are being silenced—literally and figuratively—for practicing their profession, I thought it would be wrong for me to just play down Thursday’s incident.For such display of arrogance of the powers-that-be had led to the cycle of impunity has threatened the independence of what is touted to be the freest press in Asia.Reyes has been locked up in a BJMP jail in Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan, Taguig City, for her alleged role in the P10-billion pork barrel scam, since 2014.But her detention for nearly 18 months over the worst corruption scandal to hit the country had not affected her fashion sense, or her sense of entitlement.Mercifully, the whole uncomfortable episode Thursday lasted only a few minutes and the close encounter wasn’t exactly that of the Steven Spielberg, life-changing variety.",1
"Labor Secretary Rosalinda Baldoz reminded employers to pay workers the proper wages and benefits.She said employers should follow the rules on holiday pay after President Aquino declared May 1 a regular holiday to mark Labor Day in the country.“If the employee reports for work during a regular holiday, he shall be paid 200 percent of his regular pay for that day for the first eight hours, and for work in excess of the eight hours, an additional 30 percent of his hourly rate,” Baldoz said.If the day falls on an employee’s rest day and he goes to work, he shall be paid an additional 30 percent of his daily rate of 200 percent. For work in excess of eight hours on those days, he gets an additional 30 percent of his hourly rate.“If the employee does not render work during a regular holiday, he is still entitled to 100 percent of his salary for that day,” Baldoz said.–Tina G.

"(First of two parts)When Rodrigo Duterte came to power last year, he launched a brutal war on illegal drugs. But more than 8,000 deaths later, the stories of children caught in the web of daily violence stand out as a sobering reminder that the menace cannot be stopped by bullets alone.Matthew learned it the hard way. At 13, he is a veteran of Manila’s mean streets, having quit school four years earlier to peddle crystal meth, or “shabu,” with his friends.He earned a third for every sale he made—as much as P200 in commission, or about half of the average daily wage in Manila—cautiously ignoring a public threat by President Duterte that he would kill drug pushers and addicts, and dump their bodies in Manila Bay for the fish to eat.Last August, a month after Mr. Duterte took office, Matthew was picked up by police officers, beaten and shot. But he survived to tell his story.“They would have killed him,” said a social worker at a city social welfare and development center who took him in. “Had he not been that strong, he would have died. That pains us.”The Inquirer is withholding the center’s name and Matthew’s real identity to protect them from reprisal. The facility prepares children in conflict with the law for reintegration into society.Terrible ordealDescribing his terrible ordeal in the hands of police, Matthew said he was kept in jail for days.“They arrested me. The police officer told me to run, so I ran very fast. I thought he was letting me go. But he shot me. I was knocked out,” he said.When he came to, he said, he was in the police vehicle and saw his mother trying to come near him. “The cop pinned my head with his foot and threatened to shoot my mother if I would not tell her to leave,” he said.Matthew said he was being filmed as he writhed in pain.He was turned over to the police station’s narcotics unit, where he was held for several days. “I know what I did was wrong. But I still don’t understand why he shot me,” he said.Matthew was healing fast at the city social welfare center.The boy said he peddled drugs to survive, using his earnings to buy clothes and food for his family. He lives with his 73-year-old grandfather, a delivery man, and an uncle who is mentally ill.His father, a drug user, is in hiding, social workers said.Matthew said he had been selling drugs for three months, but refused to divulge his source. “The members of my group are also my friends, and they give me food. We are happy together,” he said.“Two of my friends were killed by policemen. I was frightened, too,” he said.A companion, who was arrested with him, was also shot and wounded. He is being held in a jail in another city.The police investigator in Matthew’s case said the boy was arrested with an adult man.Contradicting Matthew’s statement, the investigator said the boy was accidentally shot when his companion tried to escape and grabbed an officer’s gun. The man was subdued and detained.Matthew was detained for five days as he recuperated, while the older suspect was detained for more than 10 days with a bullet in his buttocks.The Manila police station said four other minors had been killed since Matthew was taken in, mostly by unidentified gunmen.A 17-year-old suspected drug pusher was also shot dead in a gunfight with police.‘A dead pig’Six other children, including a toddler, were wounded when suspected vigilantes targeted a victim.As Matthew is a minor, no case was filed against him.“The place outside is not safe for children like him,” his shelter parent said.Sixteen-year-old Michael Jayson Diaz was not as lucky as Matthew.On a Saturday morning last June, village security volunteer Lourdes Luna was alerted to a sack dumped near her home at Barangay Commonwealth in suburban Quezon City.“I gave it a kick and blood oozed out of it,” said Luna, 58, who arrived at the scene with another volunteer. “I immediately thought it was a dead pig.”The two decided to slash the sack open and were shocked to find the body of a boy inside.Ironically, a blue baller on the boy’s ankle bore the name of Mr. Duterte, who campaigned on an anticrime platform.The boy was hogtied and his slender body was bent all the way back so that his head almost touched his feet. His body bore multiple stab wounds.Crime scene investigators arrived and asked the usual questions.No one claimed the body.While President Duterte was still weeks away from officially assuming power, the boy’s death was a clear indication he was intent on keeping his campaign pledge.Nida Curitana, of the barangay council’s women and children desk, later recognized the body as that of Jayson, who was frequently caught for theft and for breaking the 10 p.m. curfew in the area.Under the Child and Youth Welfare Code, the Barangay Council for the Protection of Children (BCPC) is tasked with caring for the children.Jayson was an out-of-school youth from Batasan Hills, said Mercy Aloro, a spokesperson for BCPC-Commonwealth.As he was not a resident of Commonwealth, the village had no jurisdiction over him and the council let him go whenever he was caught.The social workers said Jayson was often seen with three other minors who worked as scavengers at night but were known also as runners for drug sellers in a nearby area.Common storiesSadly, stories of poor children in the drug trade have become common. Pushers and traffickers use children because they know that under current laws, minors cannot be prosecuted.Aloro said a recent case she handled involved an 11-year-old shabu user, who was used as a runner by local drug pushers.The boy was arrested and detained for several days, like Matthew, but the court later ordered the police to free him.“The court asked us, ‘What are you going to do with the child?’” Aloro said. “We had only one answer—you cannot send him back to his community. Why? First, it’s dangerous for the kid, he’s already at risk. He could get killed. Pull out the child, that was our recommendation. So his parents sent him to Bicol.”According to studies, the high drug affectation rate in densely populated areas of Quezon City has contributed to the spread of illegal drugs. This is the same problem in poor communities in Manila, including the slums of Pasay and Tondo districts.The Quezon City police listed 160 children among those who surrendered for drug offenses from June 2016 last year to Feb. 5.Nationwide, the Philippine National Police recorded 26,415 children among those who surrendered for drug offenses from July 2016 to January 2017. More than 800,000 turned themselves in during that period.The majority of those who surrendered were drug users; 131 were arrested for delivering and 299 for selling drugs.Community leaders say the drug problem has become rampant, but perennial lack of funds and trained personnel are weighing down antidrug programs.Current laws require local government units to set aside just one percent of their internal revenue allotment (IRA) for local councils for the protection of children. And community social workers need more training on “restorative justice,” according to the Humanitarian Legal Assistance Foundation.While village social workers were already good in counseling, they have yet to learn other procedures, such as determining children’s level of addiction, the foundation said.Barangay Commonwealth, for instance, is set to launch this year a pioneering drug rehabilitation program for children, with 100 kids as the first participants.It was, however, too late for Jayson. The single-page spot report on his death has been shelved in a stockroom in the community hall.No one has been prosecuted for his murder, a cold case that serves as a cautionary tale for parents and their children in highly vulnerable, impoverished communities.",1
"A Cotabato City think tank has advised against too much rejoicing over the enactment of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), saying the charter of a proposed new autonomous region for Muslims in Mindanao still needs to clear a plebiscite and beat a possible legal challenge.President Rodrigo Duterte last week signed the BOL, a key step to ending a Muslim rebellion in the south that had claimed more than 150,000 lives since the 1970s.Tens of thousands of Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) members, supporters and local residents from various parts of Mindanao, including women in headscarves and fighters carrying firearms, trooped to the main MILF camp in Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao province, for a consultation on Sunday.‘Most people want peace’Their leaders are seeking support for the law ahead of a plebiscite on the measure, which establishes an expanded autonomous region for Muslims in Mindanao and is aimed at ending one of Asia’s longest and deadliest conflicts.“This is our dream. If we end this [fighting], hopefully we can live in peace,” Nasser Samama, a 61-year-old veteran rebel fighter, said inside the MILF’s headquarters in Camp Darapanan.“Most people want peace and so do we in the MILF forces. What the MILF has achieved is not just for our group but for the whole of Mindanao,” Samama said.The BOL aims to enforce a 2014 peace deal between the government and the MILF, under which the rebel group vowed to give up its quest for independence and lay down the weapons of its 30,000 fighters in return for self-rule.Under the BOL, a new political entity called Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) would replace the current Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) established following a 1996 deal with another rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front.The BARMM will have more powers and cover a bigger area.Last week’s signing of the BOL was met with rejoicing in Mindanao.But on Sunday lawyer Benedicto Bacani, executive director of the Institute for Autonomy and Governance, cautioned against too much excitement about the BOL, citing the challenges facing the measure.“The initial challenges [for the BOL] is to hurdle [possible] constitutional challenges and for its ratification in the plebiscite,” Bacani said.He stressed that the charter for the BARMM must first be ratified by the people in the proposed expanded Muslim autonomous region.The BOL provides that a plebiscite will be held three to five months after the law is approved to legalize the creation of the BARMM.Besides the ARMM, which encompasses the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, the plebiscite will be held in 39 villages in North Cotabato, six towns in Lanao del Norte, and the cities of Cotabato and Isabela.But the BOL may not get that far before the Philippine Constitution Association and the group of former Sulu Gov. Abdusakur Tan question the constitutionality of the law in the Supreme Court.Bacani said one of the constitutional issues the two groups may raise could be the parliamentary system of government.The 1987 Constitution provides for a presidential system of government for all of the Philippines.While the BARMM would be an integral part of the Philippines, the region would have a parliamentary government that some people see as putting it parallel to the national government, effectively making it a state within a state.Resolving a challenge could take years.But once the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) and the BARMM are in place, Bacani said the two entities should ensure that peace dividends and better security must be felt in the communities.For the BARMM to succeed, he said, it is vital for the regional government to be efficient, accountable and transparent in handling the region’s finances, and for the national government to make sure that committed funds are delivered on time.Upright governmentIn interview with Radyo Inquirer 990 AM on Sunday, Bangsamoro Transition Commission Chair Ghadzali Jaafar gave assurance that the regional government would be upright.“[W]e give our assurance that this government is different from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao,” Jaafar said, without elaborating.Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Undersecretary Nabil Tan described the BOL as “an inclusive law that will provide equal protection to all constituents in the region and not just one sector.”",1
"The Commission on Elections (Comelec) on Tuesday declared a failure of bidding for the repair and refurbishment of more than 81,000 precinct count optical scan (PCOS) machines, a development that some lawmakers fear could lead to a return to the manual count of votes.A few hours after declaring a failed bidding, the Comelec also made a ruling on a previous bidding for the purchase of 23,000 optical machine readers (OMR). The Comelec reversed a ruling disqualifying Smartmatic-Total Information Management (TIM) Corp. virtually making it the winner in the bidding for 23,000 OMR machines that will be used in the 2016 polls.Comelec’s special bids and awards committee 2 (SBAC2) chair Jubil Surmieda explained why the bidding failed. “Nobody submitted a bid. Three companies bought bid documents but none of them submitted a bid. Under the rules, that’s equivalent to a failure of bidding,” Surmieda said at Tuesday’s submission and opening of bids for the P2-billion project.The three companies that purchased bid documents were Smartmatic–TIM, Indra Sistemas SA and Vertex Business Applications Inc.The reuse of the 81,896 PCOS machines to be supplemented by 23,000 OMR units is one of the two options being considered by the Comelec for the May 2016 elections.The other option involves the use of all new OMR units—a combination of the 23,000 and 70,977 OMR units.Return to manualA return to manual elections may be inevitable if the Comelec fails to find a solution to its bidding troubles, a vice chair of the House suffrage and electoral reforms committee said.Caloocan Rep. Edgar Erice said time was running out after the Comelec declared a failure of bidding for the refurbishment of the existing 81,000 PCOS machines, which were planned to be used in the 2016 elections.“Well, if they will not be able to find a way to bid for automation asap, then Congress must amend the election law that will allow manual elections. Otherwise, it will be unthinkable,” he said, referring to Republic Act No. 9369, which provides for automated elections.Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares said he couldn’t understand why the Comelec seemed to be so “obsessed” with PCOS machines, which would require the government to shell out P14.5 billion.“Why is the Comelec so obsessed with PCOS when there are anomalies happening every election because of this?” the senior deputy minority leader said.‘Hybrid is manual’“The only option now is not to use PCOS, especially since many PCOS machines malfunctioned in 2010, which doubled in 2013. In 2016, they’re going to use same machines. I won’t be surprised if more than 40 percent of the machines malfunction. So this proposal is dangerous,” Colmenares said.He called on the House leadership to fast-track House Resolution No. 2073 to use the hybrid system using both manual and computerized systems.Cesar Flores, Smartmatic-TIM president for Asia-Pacific, said a return to manual elections would represent a return to slow results and would again open threats to and coercion of teachers and the board of election inspectors (BEIs).“BEIs will have to work all night long under difficult conditions and exhaustion, which also can influence the accuracy of the count. Lastly, on top of the vulnerabilities of the manual counting, an additional vulnerability is added into the mix, which is the discretion of the person encoding the results in the computer,” Flores said.“In my opinion, hybrid is just a polite word for manual elections,” he added.Budget cutSmartmatic-TIM said it decided not to participate in the public bidding for the PCOS refurbishment after the poll body reduced last week the budget for the contract.The original budget for the refurbishment project was P2.88 billion. But on June 23, SBAC2 announced that it was reducing the approved budget for the contract by P805.91 million after the project’s component for the replacement of PCOS units beyond repair with new machines was removed.In a letter to SBAC2, Smartmatic-TIM said: “We reiterate our commitment to the Comelec and the Philippines that we are ready and willing to perform these refurbishments. It is important, however, that the right prices are considered and the herculean tasks to be performed are acknowledged and properly compensated.”“As you can see from the overall description of the activities and parts involved in the refurbishment and upgrade of the existing PCOS machines, the new proposed budget of P11,141 per PCOS unit is completely unrealistic,” Smartmatic-TIM added.Vertex failed to meet the deadline set by the Comelec apparently also because of the changes made in the budget for the contract.“With the recent release by your office of the amendments and revisions issued, in our opinion, the set lead time for providing a meaningful and high-quality proposal is too short, especially considering the scope and complexity of this project,” Vertex said.“We, hereby, respectfully request permission to withdraw our bid from consideration due to limited time and other constraints to meet the expected requirements to comply with for the opening of bids,” it added.Indra, on the other hand, did not submit any explanation for not participating in the bidding process.Only two companies—Indra Sistemas SA and Smartmatic-TIM—submitted bids for the 70,977 OMR units during the separate submission and opening of bids conducted by the SBAC 1.Dermalog Identification Systems earlier purchased bid documents but did not submit a bid for the P7.87-billion project.While it declared a failed bid for the refurbishment, the Comelec ruled in favor of Smartmatic’s protest which allowed it to win the contract for 23,000 OMR units.“Wherefore, the instant protest is hereby granted. Accordingly, the commission hereby declares the joint venture of Smartmatic-TIM Corp. as the bidder with the lowest calculated responsive bid in connection with the public bidding for the lease with option to purchase of 23,000 new units for use in the May 9, 2016, national and local elections,” the Comelec en banc said in a 12-page resolution.In May, the Comelec’s bids and awards committee (BAC) disqualified Smartmatic-TIM during the postqualification evaluation stage of the first round of bidding after the multinational company failed to submit valid articles of incorporation. It’s demo unit also failed to meet the requirements of the project.Subsequently, Smartmatic-TIM filed a protest in the Comelec en banc in the hope of reversing the BAC decision.On Tuesday, with 4-2-1 votes, with the majority voting to grant the protest but wishing to explore the possibility of further reducing the lowest financial bid submitted, the Comelec said the decision was based on the results of the demonstration conducted by Smartmatic-TIM before the en banc regarding the capability of the proposed OMR machine to simultaneously store data.The en banc said it found the OMR demo machine compliant with the requirements of the P2.5-billion project.“We clarified with BAC if there was anything else to do and they informed us that all postqualification [activities] have been finished. The notice of award will now be given to Smartmatic-TIM and we will now proceed to discussions on the contract,” Commissioner Christian Robert Lim said at a press briefing.“If Comelec and Smartmatic will be able to agree on the contract, then we will issue a notice to proceed with Smartmatic in so far as 23,000 OMRs are concerned,” he said. “We are looking at two to three weeks of discussion. If you follow the normal course, then that’s when you will issue the notice to proceed.”The Comelec en banc decision also means that the second round of public bidding for the 23,000 OMR machines is already terminated.In a statement, Smartmatic said the poll body’s decision proved what it had been saying all along.“The reversal validates what we have always asserted—that our system is indeed 100-percent compliant, with all the technical requirements of the RFP (request for proposal), and ready to be deployed in the 2016 national elections,” Smartmatic-TIM said.“Now that this issue has been settled, we are both humbled and proud to again be chosen as a supplier of election technologies in the Philippines. We cannot wait to buckle down to work and help the Comelec with the serious task of preparing for the 2016 elections,” it added.",1
"THERE might be much to complain about in the Philippines, but 2015 bar topnotcher Rachel Angeli Miranda believes there is also as much good.“I think we as a people can be better than we are. Sometimes, we see what’s bad in the news, but there’s also a lot of good coming out of this country,” said the 25-year-old University of the Philippines law graduate who said she was keen to do her share when the country casts its vote in the May 9 national elections.“What’s important for me is that candidates should have the ability to respect the rule of law and at the same time respect the people they are serving,” Miranda said.“They have to be able to respect the dignity of the people who put them there,” she added.With a grade of 87.40, Miranda is at the top of 1,731 passers of the bar exams held at the University of Santo Tomas in November 2015. The passers made it out of 6,605 takers, pegging the passing rate at 26.21 percent, the highest since 2011.Inquirer scholar“I couldn’t believe it. I was just hoping to pass,” said Miranda, a Philippine Daily Inquirer scholar from 2008 to 2010, who briefly worked as editorial production assistant after she graduated from UP Diliman.The Inquirer Journalism Scholarship provides financial aid to topnotch students with exceptional talent for writing. The scholarships are given every other year to at least five students starting on their third year in college. A total of 72 scholars have benefited from the program that started in 1993.Set to become a full-fledged lawyer upon taking her oath on June 16, Miranda said the prospect was “a little scary.” She added: “As a lawyer, it’s your duty to do well, to do better for society. There’s a pressure to contribute.”Being raised by a pastor father and a doctor mother and having a UP background made her inclined toward human rights law and freedom of expression, her law specialization.“When I was in journalism [school], we took up a media law class. That encouraged me to undertake further studies,” she said.Last year, Miranda was part of the UP Law team that won the international rounds of the 8th Annual Price Media Law Moot Court Competition at Oxford University, the United Kingdom, a victory credited to the team’s mastery of human rights and freedom of expression law.Since January, Miranda has been an associate at the Cruz Marcelo & Tenefrancia (CMT), a law firm that includes former Defense Secretary Avelino Cruz Jr. and former Ombudsman and Solicitor General Simeon Marcelo among its founding partners.“We are extremely proud!,” CMT said on its official Twitter account.Top 10 passersAside from Miranda, this year’s top 10 bar passers are: Athena Plaza (University of San Carlos or USC, 2nd place); Jayson Aguilar (UP, 3rd); Reginald Arceo (Ateneo de Manila University, 4th), Mandy Therese Anderson (Admu, 5th), Giselle Hernandez (UP, 6th place); Darniel Bustamante (San Beda College, 7th), Jecca Jacildo (USC, 8th place), Jericho Tiu (Admu, 8th); Soraya Laut (Xavier University, 8th), Jedd Brian Hernandez (UP, 9th place); Lara Carmela Fernando (SBC, 10th), and Ronel Buenaventura (Bulacan State University or Bulsu, 10th).Lawyer Joan Largo, dean of the USC’s College of Law, said they were expecting Plaza to be in the top 10, as the only child of a retired policeman and a public school teacher had graduated summa cum laude in Business Administration major in Legal Management at USC, and was cum laude in law school.“My father would tell me ‘One day, you should become a lawyer so that you will be able to protect your family.’ That has been my inspiration,” Plaza recalled.“To be top 2 is enough for me to thank the Lord. I think this would inspire more students, especially from what they call ‘provincial schools,’ to aim for the highest position. I hope in the near future, a Carolinian will finally grab the top spot, Plaza said.Best educationHer success affirms that the best education is really just here at USC, said Largo. “You don’t have to venture far. Excellence is right here at our doorstep,” she added.Plaza bested the record set by USC alumnus, former Rep. Pablo Garcia who ranked third in the 1951 bar exams. Garcia’s rating, 91.5 percent, however remained the number to beat. USC has produced 20 bar takers in the top 10 since the university’s College of Law opened in 1937.Bulsu graduate and 10th placer, Ronel Buenaventura, was the first Bulsu alumnus to make it in the top 10 since the college opened its law school in 2002.“I am very happy to be part of Bulsu’s history. It shows that anything is possible,” Buenaventura said, adding that those coming from schools outside Metro Manila need not feel discriminated against.“Success depends on the individual’s efforts,” said the Malolos City native who graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Master’s degree in psychology at UP Diliman.Most prestigiousWhen he failed the UP law aptitude examination, Buenaventura enrolled at Bulsu law school and completed his studies in April last year.The bar examinations are considered the most prestigious professional test on account of its difficulty, and is the only licensure exam not administered by the Professional Regulation Commission.In a statement, Supreme Court spokesperson Theodore Te said the high court was “considering proposals” to reform the bar exams, “including reducing the number of examinable subjects and possible regionalization.”He said Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco Jr., chair of the 2016 bar examinations, has already held initial discussions with law school deans. “There is, as yet, no final decision by the court on this matter. However, Justice Velasco already met with the law school deans and any changes will be announced in due course,” Te said.

"OMBUDSMAN Conchita Carpio Morales, in announcing there is probable cause to file multiple cases for corruption against Vice President Jejomar Binay knowing he is an impeachable official, is playing a “perception game” meant to derail his presidential bid in next year’s elections, his spokespersons said Monday.In a press release, the Office of the Ombudsman stressed that the criminal charges against Binay would be filed in court after the expiration of his term, consistent with the constitutional prohibition against lawsuits against officials granted immunity while in office.Binay’s political spokesperson Rico Quicho said the timing of Morales’ move against Binay and other Makati City officials was “suspicious” because it coincided with the filing by the Vice President of his certificate of candidacy (COC) for the presidency in next year’s elections.Quicho said Morales’ move was not surprising, pointing out this was based on “lies” that had been heard in the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee investigation of Binay and his family.“As we’ve always said, we will fight this,” Quicho told reporters. He said the Vice President’s office received a copy of the Ombudsman’s order at noon Monday.He said Binay’s lawyers were now studying their actions on the order.Quicho said that the political foes of Binay were apparently afraid of the team-up between Binay and Sen. Gregorio Honasan II whom he said was the “team to beat” in 2016.Everyone knows that under the Constitution, an impeachable officer could not be indicted, said another Binay spokesperson, Joey Salgado.“It’s a perception game,” Salgado said, accusing Morales of “harassment.”“They timed the order with the Vice President’s filing of his COC. They want that people talk about the (Ombudsman’s) order, which when you read it, is not really about filing a case because the recommendation is after the term of the Vice President,” Salgado said.“It is oppressive and ignores due process and judicial courtesy. As I have said, the Ombudsman ordered the mayor’s dismissal and now recommends his indictment even if the Commission on Audit has yet to conclude its special audit,” Salgado explained.He added that the younger Binay was asked to comment two weeks ago with the Ombudsman also ignoring the injunction order issued by the Court of Appeals noting that it was also “oblivious to the fact that the case is pending before the Supreme Court.”“The decision was hurried since it is already election period. The timing of the release is also malicious since it was released during the start of the filing of the certificate of candidacy to destroy the reputation of the Vice President,” Salgado noted.",1
"The wait is almost over for the country’s 120,000 retired soldiers and pensioners as the Commission on Audit (COA) has granted their petition seeking to claim from the government close to P18 billion in pension arrears that have accumulated in the last 12 years.In its April 6 decision granting the claim of Conference-Assembly for Unity and Solidarity of Associations in the Armed Forces and Police Retirees, Veterans Pensioners Inc., COA told the Department of National Defense (DND) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines to pay the accumulated arrears of the retired soldiers and pensioners amounting to P17,891,468,975.The two government agencies were directed by COA to “include in their budget proposal for the succeeding fiscal year, a lump sum appropriation for the full settlement of the total amount of arrearages determined to be due” and to “regularly include in their budget proposal specific provisions for the continued funding of pension differentials.”The group’s national president and chair, retired Maj. Alfonso Besario, earlier said the pension arrears ballooned to almost P18 billion after the government “[failed] to implement well Presidential Decree No. 1638 or the AFP Retirement Law, and Republic Act No. 9166, which allows for an increase of base pay rate and benefits among AFP officers and enlisted personnel.”Under these laws, adjustments should be made by the government to the pension of the retired soldiers whenever active military personnel received salary increases.But Besario said the adjustments for retired personnel were not mentioned in the implementing rules and regulations of RA 9166, which was crafted in 2002 by then National Defense chief Angelo Reyes and Budget Secretary Emilia Boncodin.The COA noted in its decision that while the retired soldiers’ payrolls reflected the increases in their pension, these “were not paid due to lack of funds and thus have accumulated over the years.”“The annual appropriations released for the AFP as well as their savings in appropriations as funding sources were not sufficient to pay such increases,” COA said in its decision signed by Commissioners Jose Fabia and Heidi Mendoza, the agency’s officer in charge.It added that “the payables pertaining to the instant money claim were not recorded in the AFP book of accounts and no allotment was released for that purpose.”To ensure that the retirees and pensioners will get the amount due them, COA has also tasked the DND and AFP to “produce and submit” to the Department of Budget and Management and the AFP headquarters’ audit team leader “an alpha list of all individual AFP retirees, pensioners and beneficiaries.”The list will include the amount that has already been paid to the retirees, pensioners and their beneficiaries, and the arrearages and pension differentials still due them.The COA reminded that “under no circumstance shall an association or group of these retired AFP personnel or beneficiaries receive the amount intended for each retiree, pensioner and beneficiary.”To countercheck the master list that the AFP will submit, Besario told the Inquirer in a phone interview on Sunday that they are enjoining all groups of retirees and pensioners to send to their head office in JP Rizal Avenue, Townsite Subdivision, Barangay (village) Sampaloc in Tanay, Rizal, a validated list of their members.“It’s not that we don’t trust the AFP and the DND, but this is a huge amount of money. We also have to contribute to [make the process] transparent. We will act as a form of check and balance to preempt any anomalies that may arise [with regard to the money claim],” Besario said.",1
"Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak’s scandal-haunted government pushed plans for legislation outlawing“fake news” on Monday as parliament convened for the last time before an election due by August.During the coming election campaign, Najib’s foes are expected to fan suspicions of corruption over billions of dollars that have gone missing from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the state fund founded by the prime minister, and whose advisory board he had chaired until mid-2016.Malaysia’s King, Sultan Muhammad V, told parliament at the opening sitting on Monday that he“greatly supported” the government’s efforts to introduce a law to deal with“the spread of fake news and lies on social media”.“Currently social media is very influential in forming the values and culture of a society,” the King said in a traditional royal address at the opening of parliament.The final draft of the bill is expected to be presented for cabinet approval“in a couple of weeks time” before being tabled in parliament, state rub Bernama news agency quoted Azalina Othman Said, the minister in charge of law and parliament, as saying.However, Azalina said cabinet will consider if there would be enough time to table the bill in the month-long parliamentary meeting, which would predominantly debate the King’s address.First exposed in 2015 by foreign media and news blogs, the 1MDB scandal has refused to die down despite Najib’s consistent denials of any wrongdoing and his government’s firm grip on the mainstream media in the country.At least six countries are investigating transactions related to 1MDB, including the United States, where the Department of Justice has mounted its biggest investigation under an anti-kleptocracy initiative, and has launched civil cases to recover assets linked to the fund.But the government has cowed independent media inside the country. In the early stages of the 1MDB saga, the authorities suspended one newspaper, The Edge, and blocked other websites for publishing stories critical of Najib’s role, including widely read local news website The Malaysian Insider, which was later closed due to lack of funds.Governments elsewhere in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and the Philippines, have proposed laws aimed at clamping down on the spread of‘fake news’, while media rights advocates have decried the trend in the region.Opposition lawmakers questioned the need for such a law in Malaysia, arguing that the government already had broad powers.“There are many other laws that are already in existence which can deal with these issues, so the only reason for a new law to come in is to make the severity (of punishments) even higher,” said Tony Pua, a member of parliament from the Democratic Action Party (DAP).Abdul Rahman Dahlan, minister in charge of economic planning, said the bill could be broad enough to cover anything that could potentially damage the country.“Even spreading (bad) news about the economy is bad. (Fake news would be) anything that is not substantive, and dangerous to the economy and security of the nation,” Abdul Rahman told Reuters outside parliament.(This version of the story corrects paragraph nine to say The Malaysian Insider closed down due to lack of funds).",1
"Malacañang said the Philippines’ ties with Kuwait have normalized as it announced the signing of the memorandum of agreement to provide legal protection for Filipino domestic workers in the Middle Eastern country.“Nagkaroon ng deklarasyon ang dalawang bansa na itigil na ang hidwaan and we will move on. Kaya the first step in moving on is the MOA,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced late Saturday night in a press briefing upon his arrival from Kuwait with 87 repatriated domestic workers.Under the MOA, the Philippines and Kuwait undertake to “uphold ethical recruitment policies, systems, and procedures for the recruitment and employment of domestic workers, subject to the applicable laws and regulations of both parties.”Secretary Roque stressed with the MOA, Filipino domestic workers in Kuwait will now be governed by a standard contract.“Ang importante po ay ‘yong standard contract din na papipirmahan sa lahat ng empleo ng mga domestic workers, hindi lang ng mga Pilipino kung hindi ‘yong mga dayuhan na nagtatrabaho bilang domestic workers.”The MOA ensures employers will provide food, housing, clothing, and the registering of the domestic worker in Kuwait’s health insurance system. It also provides one month’s salary to workers for every year of service rendered after the expiration of the work contract.The agreement was signed by Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Cayetano and Kuwaiti Minister of Foreign Affairs Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah.“Nagkaroon na po tayo ng mga safeguards para po mapangalagaan ‘yong ating mga kababayan na magtatrabaho sa Kuwait,” Sec. Roque said.Moreover, the Palace official also announced the lifting of the deployment ban for skilled and semi-skilled workers to Kuwait, which he said was the next step in the normalization of diplomatic ties with Kuwait.The President’s spokesperson said the government is also considering lifting the deployment ban on domestic workers soon.“Naiwan po si Secretary [Abdullah] Mamao sa Kuwait at iniiwan namin kay Secretary Mama-o ang obligasyon na magrekomenda kay Presidente kung dapat na bang tuluyan i-lift ang lahat ng ban sa deployment, pero ngayon po ang pinag-aaralan ng [Department of Labor and Empoyment] ay ‘yong issue na paano talaga mapa-improve ‘yong training ng ating mga domestic workers nang mabawasan ‘yong mga issue ng takas,” he said.Roque said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III will implement reforms on the recruitment of domestic workers before the ban on their deployment is lifted.“Magkakaroon po ng mandatory training na babayaran ng mga recruiters dahil sila naman ang kumikita ng malaki doon sa recruitment fee na chinacharge nila sa mga Kuwaiti na nais mag-employ ng mga domestic workers at nang sa gano’n, ‘yong adjustment ay hindi na mahirapan ‘yong mga magtatrabahong domestic workers diyan sa Kuwait,” he said.Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, Special Envoy to Kuwait Abdullah Mama-o headed the Philippine delegation in the MOA signing which provides protection to overseas Filipinos workers (OFWs) in Kuwait.

"Governors of South Cotabato, Palawan, Zamboanga del Sur and Davao del Sur provinces currently outside the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) told a Senate hearing Wednesday they did not want to join the proposed Bangsamoro substate.Davao del Sur Gov. Claude Bautista protested that the authorities in the provinces proposed to be included in the Bangsamoro entity had not even been consulted.“We request that in order to pursue a lasting peace in Mindanao, the wish of those who do not want to join the proposed arrangement should be respected,” Bautista said in his remarks to the committee on local governments headed by Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. conducting the hearing.Bautista’s sentiment echoed those stated during the hearing by Governors Daisy Avance-Fuentes of South Cotabato, Jose Alvarez of Palawan and Antonio Cerilles of Zamboanga del Sur.Substitute billAfter the five-hour hearing, Marcos stood on the floor and declared he could not support “in its present form” the Malacañang-sponsored Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) crafted in peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).“I have prepared a substitute measure that would be good for all,” said Marcos, chair of the Senate local government committee holding hearings on the proposed charter of the proposed Bangsamoro entity that would replace the ARMM.Marcos said that the BBL “in its present form and substance will not bring us any closer to peace” but “lead us to perdition.”He said that the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process “totally ignored” some of the major stakeholders in their negotiations for peace, including the Moro National Liberation Front, the Sultanate of Sulu, the lumad, indigenous people, Christians and local government units.Marcos later told reporters he would complete his committee report after a final hearing on the measure. Marcos said he would complete a committee report on the hearings after conducting one more BBL hearing.He said his proposed alternative arrangement would be a “product of what we have learned in the hearings.”UnconstitutionalThe senator said his substitute bill would include the findings of Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago’s committee on constitutional amendments that certain provisions in the draft BBL were unconstitutional.Marcos said that among others, the controversial “opt-in” provision that would expand the proposed Bangsamoro territory should be removed.“I am confident that the committee report and the substitute bill will be completed during the recess period,” Marcos said, adding that he intended to give copies to all senators of the draft committee report and the substitute bill so that “we can hit the ground running” when Congress returns in July.Marcos’ announcement of coming up with a substitute bill for BBL came just a week before Congress adjourns its session on June 11.His announcement also meant that the Senate would not meet Malacañang’s June 11 target for the approval by Congress of the BBL in time for the election of the Bangsamoro parliament next year.Cerilles said he was for peace but his province did not want to join the Bangsamoro region. Saying that his province was giving a “resounding no,” Alvarez said his constituents did not want to join as well. Fuentes objected to the province’s inclusion in the new region.No consultations“The framework of the BBL doesn’t even give us leeway to be consulted whether we want to be included in the BBL,” Bautista said.Bautista also said he knew that Davao Occidental also did not want to be included in the core territory, something which Marcos confirmed was the sentiment given to him by Davao Occidental officials worried about the “opt-in” provision.Expressing reservations on the draft BBL was the province of Tawi-Tawi while Isabela City in Basilan province said it did not want the BBL.Also at the hearing, ARMM officials expressed support for the proposed BBL but some of them also raised some concerns on BBL provisions and made suggestions to improve the new political entity so there would be no repeat of the errors of the ARMM which the Palace had declared earlier to be a “failed experiment.”ARMM Gov. Mujib Hataman, who took over the regional government in 2011, said that ARMM under the Aquino administration was better off now. He said that GDP increased to 3.6 percent from a negative .3 percent in 2011.Investments in the ARMM also grew from P550 million in 2011 to P6 billion last year, according to Hataman. Investments have returned in the ARMM since the conflict stopped under the peace agreement with the MILF, he said.RELATED STORIESMarcos rejects BBL’s present form, says it will lead PH to perditionMarcos: Senate to be more thorough, won’t railroad passage of BBL",1

"Is Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte a billionaire? Is Senator Grace Poe truly a natural-born citizen?

"Senator Panfilo “Ping” Lacson responded to the tirades of Senator Antonio Trillanes IV against his fellow colleagues.Lacson gave the reaction, a few hours after Senator Trllanes said at a press conference in Manila Hotel that the Senate became ‘lapdogs’ of the Duterte administration and ‘don’t even like to investigate it’s abuses’ because of being ‘scared’.Lacson even mocked Trillanes saying that the senator from Nacionalista party was “out of touch with reality, if not hallucinating too much.”“I don’t know where he is coming from and I’m not even sure if he is still rationale in his thinking. One thing ‘m sure about, he is dead wrong,” Lacson said.“Calling one’s own colleagues ‘cowards’ or ‘puppets’ wholesale and without qualifying, iss the darnest thing he can do,” he added.Senator Trillanes started to release tirades against the senate after he claimed that his colleague showed no interest in investigating the Duterte administration anymore.“Itong Senado na dati ay ‘yan yung last bastion of democracy eh ngayon, wala na, para na rin kaming mga tuta nitong administrasyon na ’to. Ni ayaw mag-imbestiga eh,” Trillanes said.“‘Yung mga dapat sana na pumuna eh wala eh, sila yung mga bahag ang buntot,” Trillanes said.Trillanes believed that the strong alliance between the executive branch and the legislative brand was the reason why no one wanted to stood up against President Duterte.“Ni ayaw mag imbestiga eh.

"Graft charges have been filed in the Sandiganbayan against former Surigao del Sur Rep. Peter Paul Jed Falcon and several local officials in connection with the alleged misuse of his P18.93-million pork barrel funds on “ghost” communications equipment in 2007.The Ombudsman’s special prosecutor accused Falcon of conspiring with the officials of Lingig town to procure the gadgets using his pork barrel allocation without competitive bidding.The officials allegedly approved the payment to Philflex Trading and General Merchandise, although the purchase did not comply with the requirements regarding alternative ways of procurement under the Government Procurement Reform Act.Turned over to FalconThe charge sheet claimed that the equipment were delivered to Falcon, but he failed to turn them over to the municipality that purchased the gadgets, causing undue injury to the government and giving unwarranted benefits to Philflex, according to the charge sheet signed by Assistant Special Prosecutor III Jorge Espinal.Falcon and his coaccused were each charged with one count of violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.Charged with Falcon was Lingig Mayor Roberto Luna Jr., whom the Ombudsman dismissed in February for grave misconduct and serious dishonesty in connection with the same case.Falcon’s other coaccused included municipal treasurer Ebrencio Indoyon Jr., Sangguniang Bayan secretary and bids and awards committee (BAC) vice chair Jethro Lindo, BAC members Teofilo Maymay, Aludia de Castro and Carmelo Rebosura, and Philflex president Maria Luzviminda Lopez.",1

" President Rodrigo Duterte’s townmates believe that killings linked to illegal drugs, drug trafficking and terrorism were the most serious threats to peace and order, according to a survey by the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Davao University.The results of the survey by Ateneo’s Social Research Training and Development Office released on Friday, also showed the former Davao City mayor’s constituents overwhelmingly supported the way he was trying to solve the drug problem in the country.The Citywide Social Survey polled 630 randomly selected respondents aged 18 to 86 in the city’s three political districts from Oct. 21 to Oct. 25.It defined extrajudicial killings (EJKs) as killings perpetrated by state agents outside the judicial process.The survey said 41.1 percent of Davaoeños said EJKs were happening and 27.5 percent did not believe there were.It said 51.8 percent pointed to drug syndicates as responsible for most of the killings. Vigilantes were tagged by 35.7 percent and only 17.7 percent blamed the police, according to the survey, which elicited multiple answers to some of the survey questions.The survey said 38.6 percent believed drug suspects who were killed did not fight back but 45.1 percent thought otherwise and the police were justified in their actions that led to the deaths of the alleged drug offenders.Because of this, 44.6 percent still trusted the police, with 11 percent saying they believed policemen respected human rights. Only 6.4 percent said they feared the police.The police said officers nationwide have killed close to 4,000 people who allegedly fought back during drug raids since the President took office last year.Asked what they considered were the most serious threats to peace, the killings were mentioned by 30.5 percent, terrorism by nearly 30 percent (29.2 percent) and 32.4 percent said illegal drugs and drug trafficking were the top threats. Another 21.9 percent pointed to criminal incidents.Did they agree with, or favor the manner by which the Duterte administration was trying to solve the illegal drug problem? Yes, said 92.7 percent. Only 3.9 percent disagreed.The Ateneo survey said 77.7 percent were very satisfied with the President’s performance in the antidrug campaign and only 0.9 percent were dissatisfied.Overall, 89.2 percent believed that Mr. Duterte had fulfilled his campaign promise to fight illegal drugs.The so-called Davao Death Squad (DDS), whose operation was allegedly supported byMr. Duterte when he was Davao City mayor, was also considered a factor that threatened peace and order by 16.7 percent although 26.8 percent disagreed.An investigation by the Commission on Human Rights in 2009, then chaired by now-jailed Sen. Leila de Lima, said more than 900 people suspected of involvement in drugs and other crimes were killed by the shadowy DDS.Mr. Duterte has denied any involvement in the death squad and despite the thousands killed in his war on drugs, he has remained well-loved by the people of this city.",1

"Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III on Saturday proposed blacklisting Chinese train maker Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Co. from future government contracts as he sought a full refund of the P3.8 billion paid for coaches bought from the company but which turned out to be incompatible with rails of the Metro Rail Transit (MRT).Pimentel insisted that canceling Dalian’s contract and returning the 48 overweight MRT coaches to China, which cost the previous administration P3.8 billion to purchase, were not enough.Off the hook?“What we have here is a supplier who knowingly supplied equipment that is not suitable for the MRT. We can’t just let them get away with it with no penalties whatsoever,” said the senator.He also said future suppliers in Philippine government projects must be made aware of the consequences of giving defective products to fulfill their contracts.Dalian won the bid in 2013 to supply the government with 48 new MRT train cars to augment the fleet of more than 72 aging cars of the MRT 3, the country’s busiest light rail system.Too heavyThe Dalian train coaches were delivered in 2016 but could not be used after it was discovered that they exceeded the weight limit for MRT’s rails and were incompatible with the transit line’s maintenance and signaling systems.The Department of Transportation hired a third party qualifier to study whether the coaches could still be used by the MRT.Former Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya and six others have been sued at the Office of the Ombudsman for graft for entering into the allegedly disadvantageous contract with the Chinese firm.",1
"The Philippine National Police is asking the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) to look into eight bank accounts from which checks for P500 million were allegedly issued by suspected drug lord Kerwin Espinosa to local and police officials on his payroll.Chief Insp. Jovie Espenido, Albuera police chief, said the PNP wanted the AMLC’s help to verify if the bank accounts indeed belonged to Kerwin, said to be the biggest drug lord in Eastern Visayas.At least 500 checks were recovered by the police at the back of a chapel near the houses of the Espinosas in Sitio Tinago, Barangay Benolho, on Aug. 15.“An informant called and informed me that checks placed in short brown envelope and in folder, could be found at the back of the chapel in Benolho. The checks, about 500 pieces, belonged to and were issued by Kerwin,” Espenido said.When his men went to check, he added, they found a brown envelope behind the chapel. It took them awhile to open the envelope out of fear that it might contain a bomb.Espenido said he believed the checks were intended for the police to find to help them gather evidence against Kerwin’s illegal drug trade.Initial investigation showed that the checks belonged to Kerwin, said the police chief, but the PNP needed the AMLC’s help to verify this.Returned checksEspenido said these were returned checks, which meant the recipients had already withdrawn the amount, which ranged from P400,000 to P20 million. The checks were issued from 2014 to June 2016.Investigation showed that the checks represented either monthly stipend of or cash advance made by the officials to protect Kerwin’s illegal business.Espenido, however, declined to identify the recipients, saying only that they included elective officials and officers of police and Army, even some media members.He said the checks were forwarded to the PNP crime laboratory while the police asked the help of the ALMC.Once they had verified that these people had indeed received money from Kerwin, Espenido said the PNP would reveal the names.Come forwardBut Espenido said that he would welcome any one of those who reportedly received the checks to come to his office and cooperate in the investigation.Kerwin, whose operation reportedly covers the entire Eastern Visayas composed of Biliran, Eastern Samar, Samar, Northern Samar, Leyte and Southern Leyte provinces, as well as Cebu province, remains at large despite the shoot-on-sight order issued by President Duterte.His father, Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. who was identified by the President as a drug protector, has appealed for his son’s surrender.The mayor reported for work on Tuesday, 15 days after he surrendered to PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa to deny his involvement in his son’s operation.Two of the mayor’s henchmen, who were arrested in a buy-bust operation outside Kerwin’s house last month, claimed that the elder Espinosa was involved in Kerwin’s operation.‘Shabu’The police also recovered P88 million worth of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) from the house of the mayor, which was beside Kerwin’s house in Barangay Benolho early this month.The mayor is now facing a complaint for illegal possession of drugs at the provincial prosecutor’s office.Espenido said he had not met Mayor Espinosa yet since the chief executive reported for work.He admitted that he wanted to confront the embattled mayor over the issues against him.Due process“But I assure him of police protection. But really my hands are itchy ….” he said. “He has been accused of peddling illegal drugs and yet he has still the gall to return here. He is thick-faced.”In Manila, Malacañang said due process was being followed in the case of Mayor Espinosa.He has returned to his post “exactly because there’s due process,” said Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar.Andanar said drug suspects like the mayor were required to submit counteraffidavits, which have to be checked. In the meantime, the suspects could not be jailed, he said.If Espinosa’s counteraffidavit could not disprove his involvement in the drug trade, the police would file a formal complaint against him, he said.“There is a presumption of innocence and the principle of proving beyond reasonable doubt only happens when the case is filed in the courts,” Andanar said.He also said the surrender of 600,000 drug users and dealers, as well as of public officials whom the President linked to illegal drugs, indicated the success of the war on drugs.

"Nobody is “scoffing” at human rights. Indeed, for that matter, nobody wants a return to the bad old days when lords of the manor could simply judge and sentence peasants to be beheaded on a whim (despite Game of Thrones being everyone’s favourite TV indulgence). The trouble suffered by the garden-variety “human rights” activists that have, of late, become Netizens’ favourite whipping boys (or, worse, sad punchlines) has more to do with perception.We should recall that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who is a self-avowed antithesis to everything Western liberals (and their wannabe counterparts in the Philippines) stand for won on a protest vote. The liberals who ruled before him, quite simply, over-promised then under-delivered and, even as they did that, continued to chant — and, in the process, progressively devalue — key taglines that define their ideology many of which had to do with “human rights” and notions of “freedom”.Nonetheless, everyone who lives in liberal democracies (including societies such as the Philippines’ that aspire to its ideals) enjoy their human rights. And it is quite unrealistic to think that Filipinos (particularly those who support the current Duterte administration) would gladly “renounce” their “human rights” as Mr Gideon Peña postulates in a tweet.I wonder if those who scoff at human rights would be willing to renounce theirs.Rather, those who are in the Opposition perhaps should, instead, re-think their chosen approach of sending across the message that they alone are appreciative of “human rights”. The problem with the Opposition is their if-you-are-not-with-us-you-are-against-us posturing in which they brand themselves as the heroic last bastion of “human rights” advocacy in the Philippines. This attitude can be seen in the way the Liberal Party painted itself as the Philippine electorate’s disente option during the 2016 elections, the way Rappler CEO Maria Ressa keeps fancying herself a martyred “victim” of a “weaponised” Internet of anti-“human rights” trolls ad nauseum, and the way the broader community of moderate human rights advocates have gotten into bed with communists just to bolster their street rally numbers.The Opposition and their “human rights” cheerleaders have, in effect, formed a virtual Taliban-like holier-than-thou bloc of political correctness police that has attracted derision rather than the admiration they expected of the average Filipino man-on-the-street who, above all the petty partisanism, only wants a safe environment for himself and his family. Indeed, it is quite baffling when one observes just how obviously out-of-touch with public sentiment this bloc had become. For example, a photo of a military truck spotted on campus at the University of the Philippines (UP) posted by Leftist group ANAKBAYAN on Facebook drew jeers and snark from hundreds of Netizens who had evidently had enough of the same old Cold War era sloganeering based on a long-obsolete ideology.More level-headed Opposition leaders need to re-think their strategy and disassociate themselves and their parties from these two factions who continue to latch on to utterly discredited thinking: (1) the Yellowtards who continue a perverse tradition of fundamentalist loyalty to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan and (2) the communists and their satellites of Leftist “legal front organisations”. Both these blocs are hindering the rise of a much-needed credible and intelligent Opposition that is essential to keeping the Philippines’ fledgling democracy vibrant and constructive.",0
"The City Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (CESU) here has noted a rise in the number of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) cases, prompting the local government to step up the monitoring of infected persons.Elsie Jaca, Disease Surveillance Officer, said the local trend follows that of the national average of 30 cases per day in 2017, compared to the average of 26 HIV cases per day last year.She said that from January to July this year, there were 7,000 individuals who underwent voluntary HIV testing in Eastern Visayas, with more than 2,500 coming from Ormoc.Half of the 14 new HIV reactive cases in the region are from Ormoc, aged 15 to 34. These cases are still not reflected on the national HIV/AIDS registry, Jaca said.Statistics show that in Region 8, there have been a total of 335 HIV cases and 48 cases of AIDS from 1984 up to present. To date, Ormoc has one Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) case.Jaca said there could be more, because the list does not include the overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) from the city.She added that monitoring the disease remains a “tough challenge” because the stigma attached to the disease discourages people from being tested for HIV.She also said that those found to be positive for the HIV cannot be forced to undergo treatment because it is a violation of their rights and punishable by law.CESU reported that modes of transmission include unprotected male to male and male to female sex, sharing of infected needles in intravenous drug injections, and mother to child transmission.“There is always hope for HIV [patients]. . . you can still live longer as long as you cooperate in the treatment,” said Ma. Lourdes Lampong of the city health office. She said this is what they always reiterate during counseling sessions to avoid depression of the subject.Lampong said that in the campaign to combat HIV/AIDS, they are tapping the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) community as peer counselors.The city health office has free HIV test kits and is encouraging individuals suspected of being infected to seek early testing and counseling.",1

"A consumer group has filed a graft complaint in the Office of the Ombudsman against Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) officials for enabling Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) to forgo the bidding of its power supply contracts at the expense of the public.In a statement, Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas (ABP) accused the ERC of arbitrarily postponing the implementation of its own rules for competitive selection process (CSP) by six months.The rules, which require distribution utilities to hold competitive bidding when procuring power supply, was supposed to take effect on Nov. 6, 2015. But the ERC deferred its implementation to April 30 this year.7 agreementsABP said this enabled Meralco to skirt the new requirement, as it gave the firm time to pursue seven “midnight” power supply agreements and file them with the ERC the day before the new deadline.The lack of bidding for the long-term contracts, covering a total of 3,551 megawatts, would result in an overprice of P12.4 billion every year in the next 20 years, according to ABP.“Such extension rendered the moral spirit of the CSP useless. Government regulators should not be allowed to fool around with the rules, especially when it will harm the consumers,” it said.Because of this, the ERC officials were accused of violating Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for causing undue injury to any party or giving unwarranted benefits to a private party.Named respondents were ERC Chair Jose Vicente Salazar and Commissioners Gloria Victoria Yap-Taruc, Josefina Patricia Magpale-Asirit, Alfredo J. Non and Geronimo Sta. Ana.“The contracts are onerous and antipeople. ERC is supposed to be protecting consumers as a rate-regulating body. It seems [to be] the other way around,” said ABP secretary general Aya Jallorina.The group said corruption in the ERC was exposed after Director Francisco Jose Villa Jr., shot himself on Nov. 9. Villa left suicide notes that complained of pressure from ERC officials to hire consultants or approve procurement contracts without bidding.",1
"Jesus Catigan Insilada of Calinog, Iloilo is no ordinary teacher.A multi-awarded educator and writer, Insilada, member of the Panay Bukidnon indigenous group, introduced an innovative cultre-based teaching method and was named one of the 10 finalists, the only one from Asia, in the 2018 Global Teacher Prize which offers a US$1-million award.“I’m not claiming that I am the best teacher in the world, but there are a lot of possibilities for teachers to give quality education that is inclusive regardless of culture or economic background,” Insilada told the Manila Bulletin.No less than Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently announced the 39-year-old teacher from Calinog, Iloilo as one of the 10 teachers vying for the US $1-million fund from London-based Varkey Foundation.Culture-based approachAs the only Filipino and the only Asian finalist, Insilada is credited for introducuing a culture-based teaching method to students from the Panay Bukidnon indigenous group in the mountains of central Panay Island.Insilada, currently the principal of Caninguan National High School in Lambunao town, started his culture-based teaching method at the Alcarde Gustilo Memorial National High School in Calinog.A Panay Bukidnon himself, Insilada recalled that many of his students wanted to conceal their indigenous roots, fearing that they will be mocked and perceived as culturally backward people.“That’s what they thought. But gradually, I was able to convince them. They later understood how important it is to recognize their indigenous heritage and embrace it,” Insilada said.‘Hinilawod’ and ‘Panubok’Insilada drew inspiration largely from the Panay Bukidnon’s initiative to preserve the ‘Hinilawod,’ (Tales from the mouth of the Halawod River), an epic poem that dates back to pre-Spanish colonial period that depicts the war exploits of three brothers in the name of family and love.“This form of oral literature is used to teach poetic elements while illustrating the power of imagination by our ancestors,” he said.The innovatove educator likewise incorporated the panubok (traditional embroidery) that teaches mathematical elements of symmetry.The infusion of these cultural elements made it easier for Panay Bukidnon students to learn as they have an affinity to the concepts being taught inside the classroom.Whether or not he wins the US$1-million fund later this month, Insilada assures that he will continue to teach and espouse how education can be a way out of poverty and can uplift the dignity of marginalized communities.Super teacher and writerInsilada is a multi-awarded teacher and writer.He was named as Outstanding Teacher by the Department of Education (DepEd-Division of Iloilo) in 2008, Outstanding Teacher by Metrobank Foundation in 2014 and a recipient of the Princess Maha Chakri Award by the Princess Maha Chakri Foundation of Thailand in 2017.He bagged 1st prize honors for the Hiligaynon Short Story category in the 2015 Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature and the grand prize for the 2017 Writer’s Prize for Hiligaynon novel given by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA).He writes serialized novels for Hiligaynon magazine of the Manila Bulletin Publishing Corp.Education, education, educationWhile he has a doctorate degree, he is also the first in his family to finish college.He recalled growing up in a poor farming community and that his mother had to work as a house helper to augment the family’s income.But he knew that education was the key and studied diligently while enrolled at Alibunan Elementary School and Calinog Agricultural and Industrial College (now West Visayas State University–Calinog Campus) for high school and college.As a result, he was able to support the college education of his younger siblings.“It’s a cliché, but being an indigenous person or poor is not a hindrance,” he stressed.",1

"As the Commission on Audit (COA) begins to look into a land deal entered into by the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (BSP), one of its officials was accused of conflict of interest for reporting to Vice President Jejomar Binay in the latter’s capacity as head of the government’s housing program.At the 16th hearing of the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee on irregularities in Makati when the Vice President was its mayor, Wendell Avisado found himself in the hot seat when it was learned he has wearing two hats—as senior vice president of the BSP and as assistant secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC).Binay, a longtime president of the BSP, chairs the HUDCC.It was former Makati City Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado who pointed out this fact.Avisado ended up tangling with Senate Majority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano who questioned how the BSP could conduct a fair investigation of its transaction with Alphaland to develop a one-hectare BSP property in Makati when the former enjoyed an “intimate relationship” with the Vice President.Mercado, a former BSP senior vice president, called for a secretary general for the BSP that would serve full time in the organization so that its affairs could be managed properly.2 positionsMercado noted that Avisado was senior vice president and acting as secretary general of the BSP while at the same time serving as HUDCC assistant secretary.“I have nothing against you (Avisado) but what I’m saying … it’s because the Vice President does not want to entrust his secrets in the BSP to someone who is not his ally,” Mercado said.This prompted Cayetano to tell Avisado that the latter had conflict of interest, pointing out that Avisado had come out with statements that the BSP would look into the alleged anomalies in the land deal with Alphaland.“So there is conflict … because you cannot find anything wrong done by your president (in reference to Binay),” the senator said.Binay appointeeAvisado said he was a political appointee but when Cayetano asked who recommended him, he replied it was Binay.Cayetano told Avisado that he could not be in a body that was investigating anomalies involving Binay when he has an “intimate” relationship with him, being an HUDCC assistant secretary.“So, it’s only natural that people will think that you are here to protect his (Binay) interest,” the senator said.“No, I’m here to protect the interest of the BSP,” Avisado said.Take a leaveCayetano challenged Avisado to step down for a few months from the BSP so that an independent person could make a fair internal investigation.Avisado said he would leave it to the BSP national executive board to make the decision, prompting Cayetano to remind him that Sen. Nancy Binay inhibited herself from participating in the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee as the body was investigating her father.“And I respect her for that. She did not say ‘it’s up to my colleagues to remove me from the committee,”’ he said.Avisado still maintained he would just report Cayetano’s proposal to the board.“Don’t tell me there is no conflict of interest because you prioritize your relationship with the Vice President … If you really love the BSP … I challenge the national executive board, who do you love most? Your position, politics, who will be the next president or do you love more the BSP?” the senator said.Cayetano said that if the BSP officials loved the organization they would have created a management committee to fix things there.Avisado said he would take this up with the board and Cayetano replied by assuring him that he would not be removed from the board.Audit teamAt the hearing, acting COA chief Heidi Mendoza said the commission had created an audit group to investigate the BSP from 2012 onwards. But Mendoza also said the panel could also look at previous transactions to complete the audit.On Cayetano’s questioning, Mendoza said the COA was empowered to audit the BSP and could look into irregular transactions and incidents of fraud.Also at the hearing, former BSP president Roberto Pagdanganan said the BSP had created a committee in October last year to determine the units that it would get from its 15-percent share in its deal with Alphaland to develop Alphaland Makati Place.Pagdanganan said this was decided upon by the board in a meeting on Feb. 26.This prompted Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III to say that the land deal was struck in 2008 and that what prompted the BSP to take this action were the Senate hearings.Pagdanganan said the BSP was trying to get a “fair” deal for itself but Cayetano said the BSP should work for the “best” deal.",1

" Jujen Ababon was rushed to the hospital due to severe nosebleeding that followed a high fever last Tuesday, just six months after the 10-year-old boy received a free shot of the antidengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, from the Department of Health (DOH).He was taken to the government-run Talisay City District Hospital before he was transferred to private Cebu South General Hospital where he was placed in the intensive care unit.The boy from Talisay City, Cebu, was diagnosed with dengue.Ababon was declared in stable condition on Thursday, but this did not ease the anxiety of his family and several of their neighbors in Sitio Kaduldulan of Barangay Lawaan III, whose children also had received the Dengvaxia vaccine.“Thank God my son is safe now, and the doctors assured he will be placed in a normal ward. But we still need to pay the hospital bill (which hospital staff told me) will be at most P30,000,” said the boy’s mother, Jinny, who earns a living by making cleaning rags.The boy’s father, Junrey Ababon, 31, works as a mechanic in a shop in Barangay Tabunok, Talisay.He said they managed to secure a P20,000-loan from his employer as down payment to the hospital.He said he was embarrassed to borrow such a large sum but he and his wife only had P1,000 for the hospital bills.“She [Jinny] helped in convincing the owner of the shop to lend us money,” Junrey said.Officers from the DOH-Central Visayas (DOH-7) told the couple that their son had a normal case of dengue and this was not due to the vaccine. The boy only had the first of the three required inoculations.Still, officials of the DOH-7 and the provincial health office (PHO) said they would look into his case since her son was the first Dengvaxia recipient who had dengue.Jinny said she decided to avail of the free immunization, fearing that if he wasn’t vaccinated she might lose him to dengue.Dengue had claimed 14 lives in Cebu this year, according to PHO data.“Dengvaxia was given for free. So, of course, I made sure Jujen would be one of the beneficiaries because back then, we (saw it) as a rare opportunity. We know the shots were expensive, and dengue is a very dangerous disease,” she said.Jinny said that a daughter of one of their neighbors died of dengue last year, the first dengue fatality in Sitio Kaduldulan.“I don’t want the same thing to happen to my son, who never had dengue before,” she said.Based on PHO records, Talisay had the most number of dengue cases in the entire province, which recorded 453 patients and no fatality from January to November this year.Jinny said she regretted their decision to have her son vaccinated after learning from Dengvaxia manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur that the vaccine could cause severe symptoms in those who had no previous exposure to the mosquito-borne virus.She said the vaccination made them complacent, thinking that their son was immune after he got his first shot.At least five children aged 9 to 12 in Sitio Kaduldulan also were inoculated with Dengvaxia as beneficiaries of the government’s dengue immunization program.According to data from DOH-7, more than 150,000 children in Cebu had been vaccinated.Lileth Bistal, one of the Ababons’ neighbors, said her family was closely monitoring her 10-year-old niece, who also was vaccinated.“We were really complacent, just like Jujen’s mother. Now, we’re so worried since the news about Dengvaxia broke out, that it may have adverse effects on children who have no history of dengue,” she said.DOH-7 advised parents of Dengvaxia beneficiaries not to panic and report to the rural health units if their children showed even the slightest symptoms of dengue.",1

"At least five people, including an infant, were killed while six others went missing as Tropical Depression “Maring” swept Metro Manila and nearby provinces on Tuesday, causing widespread flooding that forced authorities to close the financial markets, government offices and schools.The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said Maring made landfall in Mauban, Quezon province, on Tuesday morning and moved northwest with winds of 60 kilometers per hour and gusts of up to 100 kph.Pagasa warned that moderate to heavy rains in Metro Manila and nearby provinces might trigger more flash floods and landslides.Officials said Jude Pondal, 17, and his brother, Justin, 14, died in the hospital early on Tuesday, after they were recovered from the rubble of their cliffside shanty, which was buried in mud by a landslide in Barangay Dolores in Taytay, Rizal province.Their mother, who suffered a broken left arm, father and another sibling survived, according to Loel Malonzo of the provincial disaster management office.In Lucena City, a 3-month-old boy died after strong rains brought down a retaining wall that buried three houses behind Mount Carmel Diocesan Hospital. At least 10 others were injured.Failed rescue tryIn Silang, Cavite province, Rossie Nasayao drowned in floodwaters trying to save her four children in Barangay Biluso on Monday night, said Kathlyn Eusebio of the Silang disaster management council.Nasayao’s body was recovered around noon on Tuesday in Barangay San Agustin 2, in nearby Dasmariñas City.“Their nipa hut was washed away. She was able to save her small children before she herself got swept away,” Eusebio said.The Pasay police assistant chief of operations, Supt. Deanry Francisco, said 12-year-old Samantha Cornejo drowned as she was swept away by the strong currents of the Maricaban River early on Tuesday.Missing in CalambaFrancisco said the girl was with four friends who had jumped from a bridge into the river for a swim. Rescue workers recovered her body from the Tripa de Gallina creek about two hours later.In Calamba City, Laguna, six people, including three children aged 5, 3 and 1, went missing after their house was swept away along the banks of the swollen San Cristobal River.Seven others, including four children, were rescued in Barangay Parian, provincial disaster officials said.Torrential rains also fell across the Central Luzon provinces, including Pampanga, Bulacan and Nueva Ecija.In Pangasinan province, officials barred fishermen from sailing. Pagasa expected Maring to cut across neighboring Zambales province, on its way out of the country toward the West Philippine Sea on Wednesday.“We do not want fishermen to be there when Maring hits the area,” said Avenix Arenas, spokesperson for the provincial disaster management office.In Aurora province, which faces the Pacific Ocean, the provincial government advised residents against sailing and fishing.Classes suspendedClasses were suspended by 118 local governments in Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac and Zambales, as well as the cities of Angeles and Olongapo.Officials in Iloilo and Antique provinces, which were not in Maring’s path, also suspended classes because heavy monsoon rains enhanced by the tropical depression caused floods in the two provinces.In Pitogo, Quezon, police rescued 25 passengers of a bus, which stalled in a flooded section of the Bondoc Peninsula Highway, where the driver headed to avoid floodwaters in the Maharlika Highway, said Senior Supt. Rhoderick Armamento, Quezon police director.Army soldiers also rescued Mayor Eduardo Severo of Calabanga, Camarines Sur province, who was stranded in a village surrounded by floodwaters.Floods forced thousands to leave their flooded homes and seek shelter in evacuation centers in Calabarzon, Mimaropa and Bicol regions, including 829 families (4,114 individuals) in Laguna, and 190 families in Batangas.Canceled flightsAirport authorities said at least 18 domestic flights were canceled due to the bad weather. Flights from Guam, Puerto Princesa and Kuala Lumpur were diverted to the Clark International Airport. A Philippine Airlines flight to Kuwait, and 17 AirAsia and Cebu Pacific domestic flights, mostly to or from the Visayas and Mindanao, were also delayed.Andrews Avenue, leading to Terminal 3 of Ninoy Aquino International Airport, was under knee-deep water, impassable to light vehicles, while water was ankle-deep in roads leading to Terminals 1, 2 and 4.Water rose in the Aurora Boulevard underpass in Cubao District, causing traffic on Edsa to slow down to a crawl from Makati City to Quezon City early on Tuesday morning.The Philippine Coast Guard reported 1,195 passengers along with 141 rolling cargoes and at least 43 vessels were stranded at different ports in Batangas, Oriental Mindoro, Romblon, Southern Quezon, Northern Quezon, Albay, Catanduanes, and Camarines Sur.A stronger typhoon, “Talim,” was spotted 865 kilometers east of the northern tip of the Philippines early on Tuesday and was heading toward Taiwan and eastern China.

"Pope Francis on Saturday blasted “shortsighted human activity” for global warming and rising sea levels and urged leaders at climate talks in Germany to take a global outlook as they negotiate ways to curb heat-trapping emissions.Francis met with a delegation of Pacific leaders and told them he shares their concerns about rising sea levels and increasingly intense weather systems that are threatening their small islands.He decried in particular the state of oceans, where overfishing and pollution by plastics and micro-plastics are killing fish stocks and sea life that are critical to Pacific island livelihoods.While several causes are to blame, “sadly, many of them are due to shortsighted human activity connected with certain ways of exploiting natural and human resources, the impact of which ultimately reaches the ocean bed itself,” the pope warned.History’s first Latin American pope has frequently spoken out against global warming and the impact it has in particular on poor and indigenous peoples. His landmark 2015 encyclical “Praise Be” denounced how wealthy countries exploit the poor, risking turning God’s creation into an “immense pile of filth.”The Pacific leaders praised the encyclical for drawing attention to those most vulnerable to climate change, including residents of small Pacific islands for whom rising sea levels pose an existential threat.The president of Nauru, Baron Waqa, told Francis that Pacific island leaders would urge negotiators at Bonn to uphold the Paris climate accord, where governments made commitments to keep global temperature rise this century below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Waqa warned that the 1.5-degree rise was a crucial threshold: “There only remains a few years before we exceed carbon dioxide levels that will make temperature rise to levels that will see many parts of the Pacific disappear,” he said.Francis told the Pacific leaders that he hoped the Bonn talks would take their plight into consideration, and look for a shared strategy to confront the “grave problems” facing the environment and oceans.",1

"NAVIGATIONAL, deck and engineering equipment are being installed on the Philippine Navy’s second strategic sealift vessel (SSV) that is undergoing construction at the PT PAL shipyard in Surabaya in Indonesia, a navy spokesman said over the weekend.Navy spokesperson Capt. Lued Lincuna told journalists he has no idea on the vessel’s percentage of completion but said it will arrive in the country by May next year. It will be named BRP Davao Del Sur.“I don’t know the exact percentage of completion but for sure she will be [home in the Philippines] by May 2017,” Lincuna said.The BRP Davao Del Sur (LD-602), launched last September 29, 2016, is the largest Philippine warship that is currently in commission with the Navy. It is the sister ship of the BRP Tarlac (LD-601) that was commissioned in Pier 13, Manila South Harbor on June 1, 2016 after arriving in the country on May 14, 2016, following a five-day journey from PT PAL’s shipyard in Surabaya.Like her sister ship BRP Tarlac, BRP Davao Del Sur is a Makassar-class landing platform dock.Its delivery to the Philippines, tentatively scheduled middle of next year, will complete the two-unit SSV procurement project with an approved budget of P4 billion sourced from the military’s Modernization Act Trust Fund.Just like its sister ship, BRP Davao Del Sur will serve as a floating command-and-control ship, especially in the conduct of humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). It will also serve as a military sealift and transport vessel.The ship has an overall length of 120 meters and a breadth of 21 meters, draft of five meters, and can carry a total payload of 2,800 tons.BRP Davao Del Sur will have a cruising speed of at least 13 knots, maximum speed of 16 knots and a minimum operating range of 7,500 nautical miles.

"For many years now, a debate has been raging on whether or not radiation caused by cell phone use can lead to cancer. Now a new study brings some good news to all who have adopted mobile technology.Scientists from the Radiological Institute of the Philippines (R.I.P.) have discovered a previously unknown radioactive wave that seems to confirm that excessive cell phone use can increase one’s I.Q.The study involved 1,000 participants — 50% of whom used mobile phones at least eight times a day while the remaining 50% used mobile phones less than three times per week.The result? Those who used their cell phones daily and excessively had an I.Q. of 120-140 (very superior intelligence), compared with those who used the phones sparingly who had an I.Q. of 90-110 (normal to average).The new study comes as very good news for Filipinos, considering that the Philippines is recognized as the texting capital of the world.It is estimated that there are 106 Million cell phone owners in the Philippines, more than its current population of 100 Million. This means that about 6 Million Filipinos own two or more cell phones each.Don’t mess with smart Filipinos!",0

"Mining companies voiced outrage on Wednesday over Environment Secretary Gina Lopez’s decision to cancel 75 mining contracts, days after she ordered 23 mines shut and five other suspended.The Chamber of Mines of the Philippines said it would fight Lopez’s decision, warning it threatened $22 billion worth of projects.The contracts are for projects in the pipeline but are not yet operating.“She’s out to kill the industry. We do not see a future for us under her,” said Ronald Recidoro, the chamber’s vice president for legal and policy affairs.Lopez’s decision has put the government at risk of spending “several billions of dollars” in taxpayer money should the mining companies go to court and sue for full reimbursement of their investments, according to Dante Bravo, president of Global Ferronickel Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary, Platinum Group Metals Corp.“Under the law, there is an investment guarantee,” Bravo told a news forum in Quezon City on Wednesday. “Congress will have to pass a law to pay for this damage or for the return of investment for all the mining companies affected.”",1
"When President Barack Obama was announced as the recipient of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, the decision was met with much controversy.Obama admitted that he was surprised by the choice. Conservatives were quick to express their outrage and even supporters of the president questioned whether the award was deserved.Six years later, Geir Lundestad, long-time director of the Nobel Institute and secretary of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, has commented publicly on the decision. In “Secretary of Peace, 25 years With The Nobel Prize,” a new memoir released on Thursday, he said Obama’s award “failed to live up to the panel’s expectations.”However, inside sources have confirmed to The Adobo Chronicles® that the Nobel Prize jury does not agree with Lundestad’s comment. In fact, when the 2015 Nobel Prize winners are announced next month, Obama will be awarded a second Nobel Peace Prize.The jury is of the opinion that contrary to Lundestad’s assessment, Obama has exceeded the panel’s expectations. “Since Obama’s first award, he has made peace with Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Russia, China, North Korea and lately, Cuba. Domestically, he has also made peace with Hilliary Clinton and the Republican Party. No other world leader has come close to this amazing accomplishment,” the jury said.In the history of the Nobel Prize, only two have been awarded the Peace Prize more than once: the International Committee of the Red Cross (3 times) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (2 times).Upon hearing the news, Pope Francis, who is scheduled to visit the United States later this month, sent his congratulations and blessings.But one person is not happy about Obama’s second Nobel Prize: Donald Trump.",0
"The congressmen who were critical of President Rodrigo Duterte would receive no budget fron the now-signed 2018 budget, including the “Magnificent Seven” who proclaimed themselves as the genuine opposition.The Magnificent which include representatives Edcel Lagman, Egay Erice, Teddy Baguilat, Gary Alejano, Tom Villarin, Raul Daza and Emmanuel Billiones were given zero budget for infrastructure funds under the General Appropriations Act.Other 17 congressmen were also denied their infrastructure budgets.In a separate statement, the Magnificent Seven labeled the recent move of the government as an ‘assault to democracy’ and a combination of ‘vengeance plus caprice.”“Exacting revenge on the genuine opposition solons by removing projects dedicated not to them but to their citizens shows their desire for autocracy, for dangerous dictatorship. The healthy exchange of opposing views is crucial in a democracy,” Ifugao Representative Teddy Baguilat, a Liberal Party (LP) member, said.Zero allocations are projected to punish and silence opposition legislators even as it is their constituencies who are deprived of the benefits of infrastructure development,” Albay Representative Edcel Lagman said in a seperate statement.Meanwhile, Akbayan Party-list Representative Villarin condemned President Rodrigo Duterte for his ‘revenge’ against the opposition who criticized his policies including the war against illegal drugs.He said that President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent moves ‘speak much about the dictatorial tendencies of this administration,’.Caloocan Representative Egay Erice said that he would fight until the ‘last drop’ of his blood to protect the people who will be affected by the budget cut.“I will fight to the last drop of my blood before the courts and on the streets if necessary to protect the 8 million Filipinos who will be benefitting from the projects,” he said in a statement.Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno clarified that the lawmakers will not get zero budgets, however the supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte will given more funds for their projects.“If you’re with us then you get something.

"Release of the New Generation Currency (NGC) Coin Series of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on Monday has been met with a lot criticisms from the public and netizens who say the new coins create confusion.The series is composed of 10-peso, 5-peso, 1-peso, 25-centavo, 5-centavo and 1-centavo coins that are all “metallic silver” in color.Netizen Sofia Aina Gabriel said the new coins are not “PWD [person with disability] and senior citizen-friendly. They may result in unintended overpayments and underpayments as they look the same. The BSP should now consider recalling the new coins.”Sari-sari (variety) store owner Eva Dizon said, “With my poor eyesight, I already find it hard to differentiate the five-peso coin from the one-peso coin. With the additional coins, it will be more difficult for me.”Addressing such concerns, BSP Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo reminded the public to study the coins closely first before making any transaction.“The differences between the NGC coins and the existing BSP coin series can be best appreciated through visual means and tactile familiarization. We should look at them first.For example, the 5-peso coin is much bigger than the 1-peso coin,” Guinigundo said.He added that that the metallic silver color of the coins will make them more durable.“They have the same color not because we deliberately made them the same color but because we decided on the choice of nickel-plating. Nickel-plated coins are more durable, weather resistant and do not easily corrode,” the BSP official explained.He said the coins have new security features, particularly the use of micro-printed details in the 10- and 5-peso coins that make duplication difficult using traditional counterfeiting methods.The metallic composition of the NGC coins also discourage the illegal practice of hoarding large quantities of coins for the extraction of their metal content, Guinigundo said.",1
"Lawyers are preparing a raft of criminal, civil and administrative charges against the governor of North Cotabato province and the provincial police commander over the violent dispersal of a peasants’ protest in Kidapawan City that led to the deaths of three farmers and the wounding of scores of others on Friday.The National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL), its affiliate Union of Peoples’ Lawyers in Mindanao (UPLM), and other groups have formed a team of at least 10 lawyers to bring the charges against Gov. Emmylou Taliño-Mendoza, police Supt. Alex Tagum and others responsible for the violence.In a text message to the Inquirer yesterday, NUPL secretary general Edre Olalia said the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) had also expressed willingness to join the legal action as cocomplainant.Six thousand farmers from different parts of North Cotabato whose farms were ravaged by drought caused by El Niño had been protesting in front of the National Food Authority (NFA) in Kidapawan for three days, demanding food aid from the provincial government, when riot police tried to disperse them with water cannon on Friday morning.The farmers stood their ground and a scuffle between them and riot police who charged their barricade ensued, protest leader Norma Capuyan said after the melee.Rocks were hurled and gunshots fired as the two sides clashed, Capuyan said.She said panicked protesters picked their bloodied companions from the highway across from the NFA building and treated their wounds by the roadside as they were sprayed with water from fire trucks.“Everyone was angry. The police were hitting us. It was a real commotion,” she said, adding that the protesters left the highway and retreated to a nearby Methodist church.Capuyan claimed 116 protesters were wounded while 89 others were missing. She reported that two male farmers in their 40s were killed in the shooting, but later reports raised the death toll to three after another shooting victim died.The slain farmers were identified as Rotello Daelto, Victor Lumandag and Enrico Pabrica.The Philippine National Police said 40 of its men were also hurt in the ruckus, two of them in critical condition.Taking responsibilityGovernor Mendoza told a news conference after the melee that she was taking “full responsibility” for the incident and that the farmers had no permit for a prolonged rally.Lawmakers, including candidates in national elections on May 9, condemned the violent dispersal of the protesting farmers and Malacañang promised an investigation.The Commission on Human Rights also condemned the police use of guns and said it would send a fact-finding team to Kidapawan to investigate.The NUPL planned legal action immediately after the clash on Friday.“In stubbornly justifying the premeditated attack on unarmed, starving, protesting farmers as a ‘clearing operation’ purportedly due to a lack of a permit to peaceably assemble, which she is empowered to issue in the first place, Governor Mendoza exhibited unparalleled remorselessness, arrogance and self-righteousness. By saying that the issue ‘is not about rice,’ she betrayed herself as [a snobbish aristocrat],” Olalia said.The NUPL has also asked the national leadership of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) to issue a resolution for an investigation of the violent dispersal of the farmers’ protest, Olalia said.The IBP chapter in North Cotabato also committed to assist detained farmers, he added.Manila-based social justice lawyer Vladimir Cabigao warned of a further “breakdown of governance” if the plight of suffering farmers were not remedied.San Beda College Alabang law professor Bruce Rivera blamed the government for not spending for preparations for the drought brought by El Niño.“This was the reason why the farmers starved, and hunger makes one angry. Our leaders should understand that a person who has hunger pangs turns into an animal. This is not understood by a leader who is an oligarch or by the aristocratic ones who want to become leaders. In a leadership where those who prevail are the few who control the country’s wealth, hunger alleviation has been forgotten,” he said.‘That’s a lie’Malacañang countered that the government had long been dealing with the effects of El Niño.Speaking on state-run radio yesterday, Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said the government laid down a mitigation program as early as August last year to ease the effects of El Niño.He said President Aquino formed a Cabinet task force to ensure food security, enough water to drink and for irrigation, and prepare communities for calamities drought might cause.“If we did not get any report of any crisis or calamity that happened in different areas, probably it’s because of [the] government’s immediate response to [El Niño],” Coloma said.He said the latest report submitted to the President on March 18 by the task force coordinator, the National Economic and Development Authority, listed measures implemented, including extensive cloud seeding, distribution of drought-resistant crop seeds to farmers for planting, and development of small water-impounding projects for irrigation.Coloma said cash-for-work programs were also launched by the Department of Social Welfare and Development and among the beneficiaries were farmers in North Cotabato.“That’s why it would be too simplistic to just say that what the farmers were asking for was not granted. That’s a lie, because the program implemented and still being implemented by the government [is] comprehensive,” he said.Rice for farmersRice donations have started to pour in for the victims of last Friday’s dispersal, with movie actor Robin Padilla giving them 200 sacks of rice on Saturday.Also on Saturday, donors from Davao City sent in 65 sacks of rice for the farmers sheltering at the Methodist church in Kidapawan.At least 300 of the farmers returned to their homes yesterday, but 300 others from Makilala town arrived at the church for a share of the donated rice.Police, however, refused to let the farmers in.Antonio Flores, secretary general of Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP), said the new group came from six villages in Makilala.He said the farmers came to get a share of the donated rice because they failed to get assistance from the local government in their town.Just following ordersBut Supt. Jerson Birrey, commander of the police public safety battalion in Kidapawan, said he was just following his immediate superior’s orders.Governor Mendoza said 15,000 sacks of rice demanded by the protesters would be released soon through the local governments.She said farmers who wanted to continue the protest could do so as long as they did not block the highway.

"DESPERATELY seeking divine intervention, Catholic Church parishes, religious congregations and various groups are turning to prayer and fasting in the run-up to the national elections on May 9.Given the muck, mud, slime and scum being thrown about during the election campaign, given the quality of candidates lording it over at the hustings and regaling crowds with pies in the sky and inappropriate jokes, these are desperate times indeed.On May 1, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) president, Socrates Villegas, issued a “pastoral appeal” titled “Prophets of Truth, Servants of Unity” that urged voters to “discern (their) choices.”“In this novena of rosaries and Masses, we claim from the Lord the gift of a godly electoral process,” said the archbishop of Lingayen. “With the permission of the bishops, the Blessed Sacrament may be exposed for public adoration to beg the Lord for the gift of peaceful elections.”He told the candidates: “Pray! Pray not only to win but pray that the Lord may show by His signs His chosen leader for this nation, this nation who calls on Him at the crossroads of its national life.”But even before the CBCP pastoral appeal, some religious congregations have already been on their knees, fasting, praying novenas and the rosary for clean elections and so that voters would be discerning and choose exemplary servant-leaders.At the Carmelite monastery in Lipa City, the contemplative nuns have been praying a novena to the Holy Spirit since April 30.A novena is a series of nine-day prayers for a particular intention.“We have been praying daily the four mysteries of the rosary specifically for the elections,” said Mother Prioress Mary Grace Rillo, OCD.At the Cubao diocese, women and men from religious congregations have composed common daily intercessory prayers and have used them since April 30, said Fr. Aris Sison, rector of the Immaculate Conception Cathedral.‘Veritas’ prayerSr. Sonia Aldeguer of the Religious of the Sacred Heart said her community had incorporated the prayers for the elections into their community night prayers.They use the “Veritas” prayer that came from the Association of Major Religious Superiors of the Philippines and its Justice and Peace and Integrity of Creation task force.Another prayer composed by one of the sisters ends with an intercession for administration candidates Mar Roxas and Leni Robredo.Aldeguer said a religious congregation in Taguig City on Friday held a forum and mock elections among their mission partners. The winners, Aldeguer said, were Roxas and Robredo.The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary (FMM) are also among the congregations that have taken to prayer and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament for the elections.Sr. Asuncion Borromeo, superior of a Cubao community of FMMs, said they were also praying the Veritas prayer. The Veritas prayer asks the Holy Spirit for “divine wisdom and insight” for the Philippine electorate.The Missionary Benedictine Sisters have been also praying and fasting, said Sr. Mary John Mananzan OSB, head of St. Scholastica’s College Institute of Women’s Studies.No endorsementIn his statement, Archbishop Villegas said: “We encourage you to pray the rosary every day and receive Holy Communion starting May 1 until May 9. In this novena of rosaries and Masses, we claim from the Lord the gift of a godly electoral process. With the permission of the bishops, the Blessed Sacrament may be exposed for public adoration to beg the Lord for the gift of peaceful elections.”According to him, the Catholic Church has never asked any political candidate to seek its endorsement.“But the Catholic Church has always demanded of Catholic voters that they cast their votes as an act not only of citizenship but also as a public declaration of faith. We ask this most earnestly of all of you, Catholic brothers and sisters, in the forthcoming election,” Villegas said.He noted that the desire for change was understandable because the people had suffered from “incompetence and indifference.”“But this cannot take the form of supporting a candidate whose speech and actions, whose plans and projects show scant regard for the rights of all, who has openly declared indifference if not dislike and disregard for the Church specially her moral teachings,” Villegas said.‘Servant-leaders’In a two-page pastoral letter issued on Sunday, Bishop Buenaventura Famadico of San Pablo City urged the Catholic faithful to vote “servant-leaders” and reject candidates belonging to political dynasties.“This is the day when we can prove how we truly love our country by using our single vote as reflection of ourselves and our share in God’s saving actions,” Famadico said.“Selling your votes and buying votes by candidates degrade into mutual manipulation between voters and candidates,” he added.

"the Republican presidential candidate knew a bigger fall out was about to happen. Other Spanish-speaking countries are also considering dropping out of the international pageant.Then came recent remarks by Trump, this time directed at African Americans. “African American youth had reached a point where they’ve just about never done more poorly, there’s no spirit, there’s killings on an hourly basis virtually in places like Baltimore and Chicago and many other places,” he said during a campaign stop.Trump also criticized his opponent, Jeb Bush, saying that, “If Bush gets in, China will absolutely eat our lunch.”And so the bigger fallout began: countries in Africa are also pulling out of the Miss Universe pageant, in solidarity with African Americans.Many Asian countries are also backing out from sending contestants to the pageant because of Trump’s comments about China.Realizing that only European countries are left to participate in Miss Universe, Trump decided to cancel the pageant altogether.“No big deal,” he said, “I’d rather be president of the United States than be an owner of a beauty pageant.Trump has risen to the number two spot, behind Jeb Bush, in recent polls among Republican candidates for president.

"“History is stereotyped to be boring and irrelevant, but I’d like to think that in the past three decades, I took history from the ivory tower of academe and gave it back to the people to whom it also belongs.”So says historian and Inquirer columnist Ambeth Ocampo, who recently won the 2016 Fukuoka Prize, a prestigious annual award honoring exceptional work in preserving or creating culture within the Asia-Pacific region, and presenting it to the world.“As an outstanding historian and intellectual, Dr. Ambeth R. Ocampo has made a great contribution to academic, cultural and social progress in the Philippines through his university teaching, his writing for newspapers and magazines and his service in historic and cultural administration,” says the Fukuoka Prize awards committee in its citation.“His clear and accessible explanations of the wider global context in which the country developed during the period of the Spanish and American colonial regimes have helped promote a more open sense of nationalism and facilitated the advancement of international exchanges both with Asia and with the West,” it says.Previous Fukuoka laureates include such giants of world culture as Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa and Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar.Among the Filipinos who have received the award in previous years are architect and National Artist Leandro Locsin and filmmakers Marilou Diaz-Abaya and Kidlat Tahimik.Ocampo, 54, is currently an associate professor in the history department of Ateneo de Manila University.At various times, he also served as chair of the National Historical Institute, National Historical Commission of the Philippines and National Commission for Culture and the Arts.However, he is probably best known outside of academe and cultural circles for “Looking Back,” his popular column on Philippine history and culture, which he started writing in 1987, and which has appeared in the Inquirer since 1990.Compiled in award-winning and best-selling books such as “Rizal Without the Overcoat” (1990), “Bonifacio’s Bolo” (1995), “Luna’s Moustache” (1997) and “Mabini’s Ghost” (1995), Ocampo’s witty and insightful essays on historical figures and their times have inspired generations of young Filipinos to take a deeper and more abiding interest in their past.“Writing the way I do … I presented the past in a friendly way and made it relevant to the present, and hopefully the future,” he says.Ocampo’s popularity has earned him criticism from some of his more hidebound colleagues in the academe, “who demand turgid text, footnotes and framework for 800-word essays.”“Unfortunately, no one listens to historians, but that’s why I have a career,” he adds.“‘Rizal Without the Overcoat’ has gone through many editions since it was first published in 1990. It celebrated its 25th anniversary last year. It’s a book that has been in print for a quarter of a century, [so] it must be relevant, I must be doing some good somewhere.”Ocampo was first bitten by the history bug as a student at Ateneo, where he credits the influence of E. Aguilar Cruz and Doreen Fernandez with sparking his curiosity about the past. His historical bent was cemented when he met the eminent historian Teodoro Agoncillo in 1984.“I knew that he once wrote history for the popular press, a genre whose trailblazers were Nick Joaquin and Carmen Guerrero Nakpil,” he recalls.“Following in the footsteps of the people I mentioned above, I wrote history built on solid primary source material, often from the original Spanish or French, and made sure that the essays were not just to inform but to entertain and educate readers into becoming historians themselves by providing a nugget of information, an insight they could reflect on.”Ocampo was first published in the waning years of the Marcos era, in the so-called “crony press.”“History, at that time, was considered safe by the censors,” he recalls. “They did not realize that, at times, I commented on the present using the past. This soon became a pattern in my writing. Inquisitive, irreverent, always making a connection between past and present. By focusing on the human side of our heroes, I showed Rizal without an overcoat, made him more than a memory fossilized in bronze and marble, and helped readers see the Philippines through the eyes of her heroes.”This has continued to be Ocampo’s modus operandi, except for a seven-year interlude starting in 1993 when he entered the Benedictine Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat as Dom Ignacio Maria, OSB, “to find God in silence and work.”“In retrospect, those were the happiest seven years of my life, my most productive, too,” he says. “Monastic life gave me perspective, taught me to listen, to reflect and be still.”After leaving the cloister, Ocampo returned to doing what he does best: turning young people on to the wealth of knowledge and insight that can be had by seeing the past with new eyes.Having a foot in both worlds—the academe and the popular press—has placed Ocampo in a unique position.“Media gives me a medium to engage the public, while academia gives me credibility,” he says. “Anyone can write about Rizal’s love life, and it is often thought to be plain gossip, but being academic means that treatment of the topic may be light but it is well thought out and based on primary source research in the original Spanish or French.”“Academics often write for each other in journals and conferences; I use academic material and give it to the public in small doses.”Apart from his Inquirer column, social media gives him another platform for sharing his wealth of knowledge with his legions of fans.“My [Facebook] page has over 56,000 likes—it’s far from Kris Aquino’s followers, but for an academic it’s quite remarkable. Here I present visuals from my research with very short text. It’s a different medium altogether.”Ocampo admits to being both pleased and daunted by receiving the Fukuoka prize, putting him in the company of such eminent scholars as Benedict Anderson, James Scott, Anthony Reid, Clifford Geertz and Wang Gungwu.“I asked myself not so much what did I do to deserve this, but what do I do for an encore?”",1
"The government should set a deadline for the MILF to comply with its demand to capture and surrender those who perpetrated the killings. Failure to comply within the deadline would be an option for the government to mount an operation and accomplish the task required.I know it's very easy for civilians like us to talk about 'war' but the reality is we, the civilians through the president, have the duty to determine the course of such delicate issues. And I say, of all the criticisms the president is getting in running the gov't, these killings will be the acid test of his capability to lead this country.This is big time. Decision to wage war against enemies has always been a standard leaders are measured of. How will PNoy handle the problem will be put under the microscope because this is no longer an ordinary corruption allegation or social bungling or petty mistakes or political gaffe that we ordinary read on this blog and elsewhere. We are talking of people who were killed while doing official acts under the authority of law. This is about the reputation and dignity of our men in uniform who looks up for guidance and leadership to civilian authority in safeguarding the safety and national security of the country.What happened was unacceptable and no amount of political rhetoric will right the barbaric wrong done. The mission is to pursue and make the guilty pay and face the the consequence of their despicable deeds and the MILF must be reminded that they are not exempted on that mission.------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"Did lawyer Mandy Anderson, the chief of staff of Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon, deliberately leak photos of her Facebook post calling Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez an “imbecile” to deflect public attention from the multibillion-peso smuggling of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) through the Bureau of Customs (BOC) express lane?Was the leak the perfect opening Anderson sought to accuse Alvarez of influence-peddling when he allegedly tried to get an “unqualified” Customs official promoted?This was the conclusion drawn by Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas, who confronted Anderson about her Facebook post during the House ways and means committee hearing on Wednesday.In a group message to House reporters, Fariñas cited the timeline of events to show that Anderson’s allegations against the Speaker were part of “clear machinations to cover up the smuggling of P5 billion of shabu” from China.Anderson however described Farinas’ conclusion as “an absurd allegation not backed by a single piece of evidence.”She added that the “theory would not only be an insult to the other members of the House, but would truly [show] the sad state we are living in, if our elected representatives can be distracted from a major shabu smuggling issue just because of the Facebook post of a ‘nobody.’”In a June 16 Facebook post where she shared an Inquirer story about Alvarez’s threat to dissolve the Court of Appeals over an interbranch spat in the case of six detained Ilocos Norte officials, Anderson wrote: “I’m hoping and praying he tries so he realizes what an imbecile he is when he fails.”She added: “Isn’t there anyone else in the House composed of 200-plus representatives who can actually be Speaker? Nakakahiya na (It has become embarrassing).”On July 25, “or a day before the hearing on drug smuggling, several House members received a copy of Anderson’s ‘imbecile’ post,” Fariñas said.Hindsight“Who could have leaked her private post if not she herself and her cohorts in order to divert the public from the House investigation of the successful smuggling of more than P5-billion worth of shabu through the BOC Express Lane?” the House official said.“Hindsight is the best sight—isn’t the dragging of the name of the Speaker by AA (Attorney Anderson) a clear attempt to divert the issue on the BOC’s ineptitude, given all the former military officials in its leadership? Were it not for China’s apprehension in Xiamen of the source of the shabu and its alerting the BOC of the smuggling of almost a ton of shabu, the BOC’s ‘Express Lane’ would have successfully facilitated P5-billion worth of shabu into our country,” Fariñas said.Beef with AlvarezAnderson, who said her “imbecile” comment was on a “private” page, later apologized for the post, but explained in an interview after the hearing that her beef with Alvarez had started in May after the Speaker tried to get a BOC official promoted to Customs operations officer 5.The BOC official said she refused after learning that the officer, later identified as a certain Sandy Sacluti, was not qualified for the promotion. The Speaker later called her to his office and berated her, Anderson said.She added that Alvarez’s staff started sending her threatening messages and in a phone call, supposedly told her that the Speaker’s marching orders were to “bring hell to [her] and the commissioner.”Alvarez earlier denied the allegation, calling it a figment of Anderson’s imagination. But on Friday, he confirmed that he had indeed endorsed a Customs officer for promotion in a May 15 letter to Customs Commissioner Faeldon. But it was not “lobbying,” the Speaker said; just one of his many routine recommendations.",1
"“IT CAME to a point that it was hard to explain. But I felt in my heart that it was something I was meant to be,” she said.“It was like defying logic because when you use logic, all the reasons are there to say ‘no.’ My (survey) numbers are low, I’m not well-known (among voters), I have no resources, everybody was against it,” the Liberal Party’s reluctant vice presidential candidate Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo said.Unlike her unexpected congressional attempt in 2013, Robredo said she was given three weeks to think about the LP’s invitation after Poe announced her own presidential aspiration on Sept. 16.Initially, she asked herself repeatedly why the Aquino administration would want her to form a tandem with LP standard-bearer Mar Roxas when her experience in politics was “very limited” and she had never participated in a national campaign.After all, she was just on her first term as Camarines Sur representative after putting an end to the decadeslong stranglehold of the influential Villafuerte political clan in their congressional district.She was also mindful that her awareness among voters was low, as shown by surveys of voters’ preference for the next leaders of the country.Prayers to late husbandTrying to make sense of the mounting pressure on her, Robredo said she actually prayed for her late husband Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo to speak to her even in her dreams.“My first question was, why me? Of all the possible candidates, why me? I’m not popular. I also do not have resources, as in I cannot contribute even a little to my campaign.” she said.Her daughters’ tearsAccording to Robredo, she started to entertain the possibility of throwing her hat in the vice presidential race when Roxas spoke to her and her three children.Roxas, a close friend of Robredo’s late husband, led the search for her husband after the ill-fated chartered plane carrying the then interior secretary crashed into the waters off Masbate province.In the days leading to her decision, Robredo said her house in Naga City became “very stormy” as she and her daughters would often break into tears when they discussed the matter.A few days before she announced her candidacy on Oct. 5, she went home to Naga and again spoke with her children. At the time, her daughters had already decided to give their consent.Roxas major factor“They told me that they felt their father would also want them to be supportive of me,” she said. “So I called up (Roxas) and told him that my children were already allowing me.”Asked if Roxas was a major factor in her decision, she said: “Yes. And it’s not only for me but also for my children.”“If not for you, we would not have agreed,” Robredo recalled one of her daughters telling Roxas.“My husband had trusted Roxas for so many years. I think my children trusted him because they know their father would not have easily trusted anyone. They thought he was deserving,” she added.Symbol of good governanceIt also helped that Mr. Aquino was able to answer all her questions and take away her doubts, including her poor showing in the surveys of vice presidential candidates.She said the President explained to her why the LP leadership chose her.“I told him all the reasons why I shouldn’t be the one but he answered them all why I should be the one. He answered even the questions of my children.”According to Robredo, the President also noted that she could be a symbol of good governance, being the wife of Jesse, who was known for engaging the basic sectors in local governance, which won him a Ramon Magsaysay Award, the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in Asia.First time“The President also noted my background in grassroots organizing which would complement Roxas’ experience (in national politics). He also told me there was still time to introduce myself to the public,” Robredo said.For Robredo, the 2016 elections would offer the Filipino people a chance to continue the gains of the daang matuwid (right path), the Aquino administration’s centerpiece anticorruption agenda.“This is the first time that the people are looking for the continuation of the administration’s policies and not to change it with something new. That only means (what) we did was right,” Robredo said.“But we will not just continue what we have seen and felt. We will also strengthen and expand them … so that we will be able to shake even the bottom.”Part of job descriptionSaid Robredo: “All the people who really love me, including my constituents, did not want me to run. If there was pressure, it was really pressure for me to say ‘no.’ The strongest lobby group consisted of my three daughters, my mother and the siblings of my husband.”She also sought the assistance of her spiritual advisers in coming up with a decision which, she said, became a very emotional moment for her and her family.From a reluctant veep candidate for the 2016 elections, she is now prepared to be President—if necessary—should she win what is touted to be one of the hotly contested vice presidential races in the country’s history.“If you run for Vice President, you should be ready to become President because that’s one of the job descriptions,” Robredo said.“But it’s not something I wanted or wish for. When the opportunity presented itself and there was a call, it was difficult to resist,” she added.“Being President is very difficult. All the blame and the problems of the country would be on you. It’s not something you would wish even to your worst enemy.”Pressure from her childrenRobredo said vying for the second highest elective position in the land was already “way beyond my wildest dreams.”“It’s not as if I wanted this. Maybe because I’m the wife of my husband, my orientation was to be ready to make the sacrifice when need be,” she said in Filipino.She dismissed insinuations that Roxas and President Aquino had forced her to run for Vice President, saying she actually had to hurdle “strong pressure” from her children, relatives and other close friends to shun the invitation from the LP.Robredo became the LP’s most viable vice presidential candidate after Sen. Grace Poe spurned the administration party’s monthslong pursuit to convince the senator to team up with Roxas.RELATED STORIESRoxas-Robredo tandem: Together but separateLeni: Bus rides keep me grounded",1
"Yesterday, we reported that the Philippine government has approved the importation of 500 tons of plastic wrap in order to meet the demand resulting from the laglag bala scheme whereby bullets are allegedly being planted in bags of unsuspecting passengers going through the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) for purposes of extortion.Desperate times call for desperate measures.Many passengers, unable to procure plastic wrap to protect their luggage from being targeted by the schemers, are turning to aluminum foil which is plenty in supply from local supermarkets and other retailers in Metro Manila.But these passengers only end up in frustration upon arriving at NAIA to be told that aluminum foil cannot be used to wrap their bags because it is against airport security regulations.Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) General Manager Jose Angel Honrado said that x-ray cameras cannot see through aluminum foil and won’t be able to detect bullets, illegal substances and other prohibited items.Honrado warned that bags wrapped in aluminum foil will be confiscated and will not be allowed on board any departing aircraft.",0
"Saying that no one can predict or prepare enough for a disaster as powerful as a 7.2-magnitude earthquake, Governor Wilhelmino M. Sy-Alvarado emphasized yesterday the need for greater awareness, a perfect execution of emergency drills, and a prayer.During seminar workshops on disaster and earthquake preparedness, Alvarado urged village officials to install loud speakers in their Barangay Halls not only to warn and inform people in times of emergency but also for daily 2nd Chronicles Chapter 7, Verse 14 praywers.The verse says: “If my people, who are called by My name, will humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”The governor attended recent calamity preparedness workshops, particularly for the so-called “Big One” – a .7.2-magnitude tremor caused by the movement of the West Valley Fault on which a great part of Bulacan lies – in Barangays Gugo and Calizon in San Miguel; Meysulao in Calumpit; and San Juan and Tampok in Hagonoy.",1

Plunder charges, however, will no longer be pursued.Prosecutors indicted former Budget Secretary Rolando Andaya Jr., former Agrarian Reform Secretary Nasser Pangandaman, businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles and 22 others for 97 counts each of malversation through falsification and violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.The charges were filed on Dec. 1, but the cases were made known to reporters only on Thursday because of the sheer volume of documents, totaling 1,164 pages.The Ombudsman’s Public Information and Media Relations Bureau said a Sept. 5 order partially granted the respondents’ appeal and dropped its finding of probable cause to file plunder charges under its December 2016 resolution.Andaya confidentAndaya, currently a Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, said he found the downgrading of the plunder complaint as a point in his favor. “[This] means that the original indictment actively sought has been debunked,” he said.In a statement, Andaya said he welcomed the filing of the case, “confident that at the end, when my side will be fully heard and the evidence I submit will be appreciated, truth will prevail and I shall be acquitted of the charges against me.”Forged lettersThe officials were accused of diverting the Malampaya gas field royalties to dubious nongovernment organizations (NGOs) allegedly ran by Napoles, a scheme reminiscent of the P10-billion pork barrel scam.Just like in the pork barrel scam cases, whistle-blowers Benhur Luy, Merlina Suñas and Marina Sula will be presented as prosecution witnesses.Napoles’ children Jo Christine and James Christopher, brother Reynald Lim, nephew Ronald John Lim, and other employees allegedly forged the request letters of the mayors of 97 towns and cities in Luzon, only for the funds to be diverted to what turned out to be “ghost” livelihood projects.For his role in the scheme, Pangandaman allegedly received commissions from Napoles through former Mayor Rene Maglanque of Candaba, Pampanga province.According to the charge sheets, Pangandaman directed Agrarian Reform Undersecretary Narciso Nieto to request P900 million in discretionary funds “without any clear basis.”He allegedly requested the release of a notice of cash allowance only on the sole claim that the P900 million was already fully obligated, without validating the regularity and the legality of the obligations.For his part, Andaya allegedly approved the request for the discretionary funds “despite the lack of any clear basis.”Ruby TuasonAlthough Department of Budget and Management Director Nora Oliveros observed a lack of supporting documents, Andaya allegedly signed the special allotment release order and the notice of cash allocation requested by Pangandaman before she reviewed the request.Ruby Tuason, whose request for immunity was rejected by the Ombudsman, allegedly helped facilitate the scheme “by finding, through her brother, a contact in Malacañang.” She was also allegedly paid kickbacks by Napoles.Other Department of Agrarian Reform officials—chief administrative officer Ronald Venancio, chief accountant Angelita Cacananta and finance director Teresita Panlilio—were faulted for processing the payments to fake mayor-beneficiaries despite the “attendant glaring irregularities” in the supporting documents for the transactions.Like Pangandaman, Panlilio was accused of receiving commissions from Napoles.Ma. Winnie Villanueva, a former manager of the Metrobank Magdalena branch in Binondo, Manila, allegedly facilitated the diversion of the funds by allowing 12 Napoles-linked NGOs to open bank accounts despite submitting questionable documents.Prosecutors recommended that bail be set at P30,000 for each count of graft and P200,000 for each count of malversation through falsification, or a total of P22.31 million for each of the accused.Arroyo, ErmitaThe National Bureau of Investigation originally included former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and her former Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita in its complaint, on grounds that her Executive Order No. 848 made it possible to use the funds for nonenergy-related projects under the guise of assistance to the victims of widespread flooding in 2009.But the Ombudsman said in its December 2016 resolution that there was no probable cause to charge Arroyo and Ermita, as they were found to have issued the executive order in good faith.The legality of the executive order was based on Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 910, before spending under the decree was declared unconstitutional for diverting the gas field royalties to uses outside the energy industry.PD 910 created the special fund to finance energy resource development programs and projects and “for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President.”",1

"Palace finds VP Robredo’s remark ‘out of touch’.Malacanang has found Vice President Leni Robredo’s claim that darkness is enveloping the country as “completely out of touch.”“With all due respect to the Vice President, we find Ms. Robredo’s remarks during the anniversary of the Liberal Party completely out of touch with the existing realities on the ground,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in a press statement on Sunday.Robredo said in her speech during the 72nd anniversary of the Liberal Party last Friday that “darkness envelops” the Philippines, urging her partymates not to lose hope.Contrary to the Vice President’s claim, Roque said the Filipino people are beginning to feel genuine and meaningful change under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.“The darkness that Vice President Robredo may be referring to perhaps pertains to the future of those discredited politicians whowish to return to power,” Roque said.Roque said Gallup International has ranked the Philippines as the third happiest country in the world and fifth highest country in terms of economic optimism index.Meanwhile, Social Weather Stations (SWS)’s separate survey found 96% of Filipinos have entered 2018 with hope while fewer Filipinos considered themselves poor.“People’s high levels of hope and optimism have been complemented by high satisfaction, approval, trust ratings,” Roque said.President Duterte is the most approved (at 80%) and the most trusted (at 82%) among the top national officials of this country, according to the last quarter 2017 Pulse Asia survey.According to the last quarter 2017 SWS survey, more than eight out of ten Filipinos trust the President while the net satisfaction rating of his cabinet remains the highest since 1990 at +32.A SWS survey also shows that satisfaction with the Duterte administration is excellent (at +70) – the highest recorded for any administration in the last 28 years.

"Malacañang on Tuesday said postponing the 2019 elections should be done only if a new Constitution would be drafted and ratified by the people before the polls. Otherwise, it said, there is no reason to stop the scheduled balloting.At a Cabinet meeting on Monday, President Rodrigo Duterte “reiterated he is against no-el,” or “no-election,” said presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.“He wants to push through with the elections in 2019 and has committed to give us the most honest and the most credible elections in 2019,” Roque said.Mr. Duterte’s allies have floated the idea of postponing the elections next year and extending the terms of elected officials as part of the transition to a federal government.If the new Constitution has been ratified, then there will be no need to hold the 2019 elections, Roque said.“As I said, if they are able to amend the Constitution and have the people ratify it before 2019, that’s the only possibility of the postponement of the elections,” he added. “But unless the Constitution is actually ratified by the people and the President calling for the transitory provisions, the elections will push through.”The top leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives have agreed to convene a constituent assembly (Con-ass) to amend the 1987 Constitution for a shift to a federal form of government.House discussions beginIn the House, the committee on constitutional amendments will begin discussions this month on a draft of a new Constitution based on federalism models earlier presented to the panel, according to a House leader.“[T]he subcommittees of the House committee on constitutional amendments are scheduled to submit their output to the mother committee this January,” Deputy Speaker Fredenil Castro said.Castro, vice chair of the constitutional amendments committee, said the “output,” or the draft federal Constitution, should be debated and put to a vote by the House panel.“Then, the House will have to wait for the action of the Senate on the joint resolution calling the House and the Senate to convene as a Con-ass,” he said, referring to Concurrent Resolution No. 9.“The decision of the Senate, whether negative or positive, will dictate the next procedure to be followed by the House,” Castro told the Inquirer.Concurrent Resolution No. 9 seeks “to constitute the Congress of the Philippines as a Con-ass for the purpose of proposing amendments to, or revision of, the 1987 Constitution.”Under a Con-ass, the Senate and the House, acting as one body, will introduce and approve changes to the Charter by an absolute three-fourths vote and the approved changes will be submitted to a national referendum.The House began plenary debates on Concurrent Resolution No. 9 on Dec. 13, while the Senate version was expected to be filed this week.Both Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III have agreed publicly to adopt the measure.Two proposed draftsWhile the mode of Charter change is under discussion, the House constitutional amendments committee has begun consolidating two proposed drafts of a new Constitution that will later be submitted to a Con-ass, once it is convened.The first is Resolution of Both Houses No. 8 containing an 83-page draft proposal of the new Charter filed by ABS Rep. Eugene Michael de Vera and Pampanga Rep. Aurelio Gonzales Jr.The second is a draft Charter prepared by the PDP-Laban Federalism Institute from a study group led by the institute’s executive director Jonathan Malaya and University of Santo Tomas professor Edmund Tayao.Based on these two models, the House panel formed four technical working groups to handle specific areas in the drafting of the new “Philippine Federal Constitution.”Click here for more elections stories.",1
"Roxas and the ""lower classes""“[Roxas] believed he was well qualified and could do the job, but had trouble getting media coverage and said television ads were going to be expensive. Roxas said that only Manuel Villar had the funds to buy television time at this stage… The key to victory, Roxas said, would be convincing the lower classes that [he] had their interests at heart. Roxas confided to the Ambassador that he was not sure how he personally would tackle that problem, given that his Wharton MBA and ten years on Wall Street as an investment banker did not ‘exactly call to the common man’[Wikileaks]""US Ambassador Kristie KenneyRemember this?Erap's comebackDILG Sec. Mar Roxas with Manila Mayor Erap Estrada in the early 2010s.Pres. Manuel Roxas and the Surplus War Property ScandalThe “Yellow Fever”Cory's 2009 funeral procession.Cojuangco money is not enoughCory and Peping: siblings Danding: Cory’s and Pepings’ first cousin.The Cojuangcos bicker up to this day.Sorry, I can't help it.Cojuangcos betray MarThe Samar Group, named after PNoy’s campaign headquarters in Samar Avenue, Quezon City, is led by Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa and whose membership includes members of the Cojuangco-Aquino family (that includes the blabbermouth Kris). Samar is sympathetic to the Binays. The Balay group, named after the Roxas estate in Cubao, is made up of Liberal Party stalwarts, defecting Arroyo cabinet members (the Hyatt 10), and is generally sympathetic to Mar Roxas[to be continued]After a 6-year delay, Roxas believes that now is his time to become the President of the Republic. There’s a part of me that understands what he feels. After all, he’s already been sidetracked... twice.Liberal Party President and former Senator Manuel ’Mar’ Roxas was set to run for president in 2010. In a shocking turn of events, however, he voluntarily stepped aside to let Senator Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino run in his stead. Everyone knows the basic story, but ThinkingPinoy believes that few know what really happened behind the scenes.In this article, let ThinkingPinoy tell you the story of how factions within Daang Matuwid shaped the past six years, and how it may shape the 2016 Philippine Presidential Elections.In as early as 2008, Roxas knows that he will have to cross the seven seas to win the 2010 presidency. His predicament is best described in a leaked 2008 diplomatic cable prepared by US Ambassador Kristie Kenney:Yes, Roxas told Kenney that he had a Wharton MBA [ TP ], but we will not talk about that anymore.Roxas found the prospect of a head-to-head presidential battle with Villar problematic, as it would come at great financial and political cost but with little to no real assurance of a favorable outcome. Something that's contrary to his instincts as an ""investment banker"" [ TP: Banker ].The billionaire Villar has pockets deeper than the waters of Manila Bay. He can launch a de facto campaign anytime he wants, for as long as he wants. Roxas, whose net worth was less than P250 million, has no means to do that on his own. Villar can easily outspend Roxas, hands down [ Forbes ].But for Roxas, the lack of appeal to “the lower classes” and his lack of funding are just two of three problems.The Mar of the mid-200s thought Erap stood no chance at winning 2010. But by 2008, the convicted-then-pardoned plunderer has become the top pick in pre-electoral surveys [ GMA ]. After all, third-stringer Estrada, despite being scorned by ABC voters after the impeachment trial, still enjoys the support of the massive DE.Yes, Erap has became a legitimate 2010 presidential contender. I can just surmise Roxas’ regret for recommending Erap’s 2007 pardon to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo [ Senate ].Roxas lacks a solid voter base like Erap’s classes D and E. His pockets, while deep, are not as deep as Villar’s. With no solid following, no charisma, and (relatively) no funds, Roxas has nothing else to bank on except the Roxas family name.But then, his President-grandfather’s legacy is hardly memorable, with a portrait on the 100-peso bill as the only widely accessible reminder of his political existence. Besides, who would want to remember the late President Roxas’ legacy?I am sure even Mar wouldn’t want that. Let me quickly tell you why:Despite reigning for less than two years, postwar President Manuel Roxas Sr. managed to entangle himself in three major scandals: the Bell Trade Act [ Brittanica ] , the Surplus War Propery Scandal [ Simbulan 2005 ], and the Chinese Immigration Quota Scandal [ Jurado 2015 ], all of which may be used as fodder by his election rivals at the most opportune moment.Mar Roxas’ chances of winning the 2010 race is 50-50, at best. That doesn’t sound good.Former President Corazon “Cory” Cojuangco-Aquino death in August 2009 shocked the nation [ BBC ]. Because Filipinos widely regard Cory as Philippine democracy icon, her death resulted into a deluge of public sympathy for the surviving members of the Cojuangco-Aquino family. The months following her death was filled with an air of nostalgia for the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution, where Cory served as the figurehead.To cut the long story short, her son Noynoy rose to the top of surveys a month later [ Reuters ].Public grief over her loss is palpable. During those times, anything – or anyone – Aquino is as appealing to the public as the latest ABS-CBN soap.Roxas saw what that meant, and he did what he thought he had to do.Roxas stepped aside and allowed Senator Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino, Cory’s only son who also happens to be named after the hero Ninoy, run in his stead. Subsequently, Mar settled to run for the vice-presidency [ ABSCBN ].At this point, two of the Liberal Party’s three-fold dilemma – lack of charisma and lack of a solid voter base – were solved via the massive sympathy vote.Now, they have one last thing to worry about: money.The extremely wealthy Cojuangco Political Dynasty, where Noynoy belongs, is a prime source of campaign kitty. However, the clan’s leaders have differing, and oftentimes clashing, political interests.Two major “political” factions exist within the Cojuangco clan:Aside from the automatic backing of his immediate family, Noynoy also secured the support of Tito Peping [ ABSCBN ]. However, Tito Danding was torn between his two nephews Noynoy and Gibo (Teodoro), who’s also running [ Philstar ].Danding eventually decided to support Noynoy in February 2010 [ GMANews ], but his decision came way into the election season. That is, in as far as LP's campaign planning, Danding's financial support was not factored in.That’s a major setback, considering that Danding is arguably the wealthiest Cojuangco alive, thanks to the Coco Levy funds he plundered decades ago [ TP: Coco Levy ].Historically rich familes (Old Money Families), do not think of family-owned funds as a tool for personal gain. Instead, they think of themselves as stewards of their financial capital [ Bonner 2012 ].Confining the comparison to members of the Cojuangco clan, Danding is the most noveau riche among the three. That is, Danding most likely has more liquid assets than Cory and Peping.Too bad for LP, Danding roots for someone else. Hence, the dynamic duo of BatMar (Roxas) and Noybin (Noynoy) had to seek help from other sources.For better or for worse, the duo sought help from private businessmen. This includes the illegal miner Eric Guttierez, owner of SR Metals Inc. Guttierez lent LP his plane/s for use in the 2010 campaign [ TP: Campaign Planes ].At that point, all bases were covered. BatMar and Noybin are ready to rumble.But, at the last minute...The 2010 Presidential race an extremely one-sided affair in favor of the Cojuangco-Aquino scion. Noynoy consistently topped surveys month after month, and eventually won by landslide.VP bet Mar, however, was not as fortunate.Roxas consistently edged then-Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay in all surveys immediately preceding the May elections. With at least 10% over Binay in both SWS and Pulse Asia surveys in late April 2010, the gap more than compensated for the margin of error. On the day before the elections, almost everyone was expecting to have a Vice-president Roxas.But that didn’t happen. Because of factionalization among PNoy’s core political allies.PNoy’s political allies are divided into two major factions: Samar and Balay [ ABS-CBN ].Samar secretly dumped Mar and supported Binay in the last few weeks of the campaign. That is, Samar’s clandestine support fueled Binay’s last-minute surge [ GMANews ].Did you like this post? Help ThinkingPinoy.com stay up!

"US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he intends to visit China, Japan and South Korea later this year, a blockbuster maiden presidential visit to Asia.Trump said aboard Air Force One that a US delegation would likely make the trip in November, adding that he will ‘’possibly’’ go to the APEC summit in Vietnam at the same time.The announcement sets the stage for a wildly ambitious first visit to a region that is vital to US economic and security interests.The visit is likely to focus heavily on trade and North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic weapons programs, one of Trump’s biggest security challenges since coming to office.Trump has repeatedly said that he will not tolerate Pyongyang developing the capability of hitting the United States with a thermonuclear weapon, threatening to rain down ‘’fire and fury’’ if necessary.But with North Korea on the cusp of marrying nuclear warhead and intercontinental ballistic missile technology, Trump has struggled to get China to buy in to biting sanctions.The visit will be another opportunity for Trump to press his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, and crucially will come after an October Congress of the Communist Party.Privately, US officials admit Xi is unlikely to back tougher sanctions before that meeting, which sets the course for China’s leadership in the next five years.Vice President Mike Pence had earlier announced that Trump would also visit the Philippines in November for an ASEAN summit, but the president was more cool to the idea.Trump said only that ‘’he invited us so we’re going to see,’’ apparently referring to controversial President Rodrigo Duterte.",1
"Superintendent Noel Versoza, who was wounded in an ambush last Friday morning in this city, believes he was saved as soon as he decided to head for the Antipolo Cathedral to seek refuge while his self-driven car was receiving fire.In a phone conversation from his hospital bed inside Camp Crame, Quezon City yesterday, Verzosa said: “Bigla na lang pumasok sa isip ko na iderecho sa simbahan ng Antipolo ang sasakyan ko. Hindi na rin sumunod ang bumabaril sa akin nang makarating ako sa tapat ng simbahan (It suddenly came to my head that I drive straight to the Antipolo Cathedral. The shooters did not follow as soon as I reached the church).”Versoza, 50, former chief of the Binangonan Municipal Police Station (MPS) in this province and now assigned at the Personnel Division of the Police Regional Office 4-A (PRO4-A) Headquarters in Laguna, said he believes his being a Catholic and Bible reader spared him from imminent death at the hands of his armed assailant.It will be recalled that he had just pulled out of a gasoline station on J.P. Rizal Street, Barangay Dela Paz here, at 6 a.m. Friday, when a gunman appeared and started firing at his vehicle, wounding him in the left arm.Versoza told The Manila Bulletin that he suspects the attack was planned by groups behind the operation of illegal drugs in Binangonan, which he hit hard during his stint as the municipality’s police chief until his relief last May 15.While his attacker was wearing a surgical mask, investigators are reviewing a recording from a closed-circuit television (CCTV) that captured the shooting incident.",1
"Calling it a travesty of justice, a Malacañang official on Monday said the Duterte administration would “exercise all legal options” to overturn the Court of Appeals ruling that saved former Palawan Gov. Joel Reyes from standing trial for the 2011 murder of environmentalist and broadcaster Gerry Ortega.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said he would meet this week with Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II and Solicitor General Jose Calida to tackle the Ortega murder case and other high-profile cases.“We will exercise all legal options to reverse this decision of the Court of Appeals… That’s an official stand of the Philippine government,” Roque said in a media briefing.“The government will exhaust all remedies, including filing first a motion for reconsideration,” he added.It’s up to the OSGAt the Department of Justice, Aguirre said it was up to the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) to appeal the ruling.“It is the OSG that is in charge of the case since it is on appeal,” Aguirre said.“The filing of an appeal depends on the ruling if it will constitute double jeopardy,” he added.In a 3-2 decision on Jan. 4, a five-member special division of the appeals court exonerated Reyes, the alleged brains behind the murder of Ortega.The special division ruled that the Puerto Princesa Regional Trial Court (RTC) abused its discretion when it decided there was probable cause to charge the former governor of involvement in the killing of the broadcaster.“Call it a second chance afforded him by God or a lucky three-point play for him, to use a common street lingo, or a miracle in his favor, [Reyes] must by all means be exonerated from the charge,” Associate Justice Normandie Pizarro, writing for the majority, said in the ruling.Associate Justices Danton Bueser and Victoria Paredes concurred with Pizarro’s opinion, while Associate Justices Maria Filomena Singh and Marie Christine Azcarraga-Jacob dissented.Roque described the ruling as “alarming” and a “travesty of justice.”The presidential spokesperson once served as a private prosecutor on the case until June 2016, when he joined the House of Representatives as a party-list nominee.It’s a ‘mystery’“For the first time, I was allowed by the President to comment in my individual capacity [on] this case … It is not true that the case was a ‘miracle,’ [as described by Pizarro]. The case, true, is a [mystery] that is really a travesty of justice,” he said.He said there was a prior Supreme Court decision on the case that said it was “up to the Regional Trial Court to determine the existence of probable cause, which had been already determined by the Regional Trial Court.”“So, I find it alarming that this [appeals court] decision overruled an earlier [Supreme Court] decision and arrogated its own judgment for that of the Regional Trial Court, [which] had [the] opportunity to physically accept the evidence, observe the demeanor of the witnesses, and concluded that there was probable cause,” Roque said.Extrajudicial killing“We had concluded the presentation of all evidence for the prosecution and the defense had also concluded its presentation of evidence and there was already a decision of the lower court that evidence of guilt was strong against former Gov. Joel Reyes,” he added.Roque noted that Ortega’s murder fit the government’s official definition of an extrajudicial killing.“This is a very sad development for freedom of the press in this country given that the murder of Gerry Ortega is a classic case of extralegal killing since Gerry Ortega was both a member of the journalism profession and he’s also an activist,” the Palace official said.Ortega was shot dead by a hired gunman on Jan. 24, 2011, and Reyes had been pinpointed as the mastermind.The investigation led to the indictment of Reyes, his younger brother, former Coron, Palawan, Mayor Mario Reyes, and several people formerly connected with the provincial government of Palawan.ReinvestigationReyes was initially absolved by a justice department panel of investigators, but then Justice Secretary Leila de Lima rejected the decision and formed a second panel, which found prima facie evidence to indict him.In 2012, the Reyeses went into hiding before the Palawan Regional Trial Court could issue warrants for their arrest.Joel Reyes questioned before the appeals court the validity of the creation of a second panel and asked the tribunal to dismiss the case on that basis.The case went through the courts while the Reyeses were in hiding. They were eventually arrested in Thailand and brought back to the Philippines to face trial in 2015.Mario Reyes, however, was allowed to post bail in 2016. On Friday, Joel Reyes was released from jail after the appeals court handed down its ruling.Roque said Joel Reyes should be placed on the Bureau of Immigration’s watch list to prevent him from escaping again.",1

"Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Sunday vowed that the military would crack down “decisively and expeditiously” against rebels a day after Congress approved overwhelmingly the extension of martial law in Mindanao through the end of the year.Lorenzana did not elaborate in a statement but the scope of the “key tasks” of the military’s operational directive to implement martial law included “degrading armed capabilities of the New People’s Army” and the dismantling of “other terror-linked private armed groups, illegal drug syndicates, peace spoilers and other lawless armed groups.”Mr. Duterte placed the entire Mindanao under martial rule on May 23 to give the military greater elbow room to deal with the Islamic State-inspired Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists in Marawi City.Last week, the President scuttled peace talks with the communists following stepped up attacks by New People’s Army guerrillas on several fronts.After a two-month military campaign in Marawi, nearly 600 are dead: 114 government security forces; 45 civilians; and 428 enemies, according to the latest figures released by the Armed Forces of the Philippines on Saturday.“With the overwhelming vote of confidence from our legislature and the ardent support of the Filipino people, your defense department will strive even more to deal with the rebellion decisively and expeditiously,” Lorenzana said.He also called on those “who have lost their way” to return to government fold.“This government is giving us the opportunity to grow in an honorable way.

"An initial check conducted by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) here reportedly revealed that the sperm whale, which was found beached in front of a resort in Babak District in the Island Garden City of Samal Saturday, had large amounts of plastic trash, fishing nets, hooks and even a piece of coco lumber in its stomach.According to BFAR Region 11 Director Fatima Idris, the debris were found inside the stomach of the 37-foot whale as the agency conducted a necropsy Sunday. She said the whale was a juvenile male.Cetacean expert Darrel Blatchley had earlier suspected that the whale could have either choked on plastic trash or was mortally wounded by propellers of vessels plying the Davao Gulf.News of the whale washing up the beach on a resort in Samal broke out late Saturday afternoon.BFAR has a marine mammal stranding network which is always on the look-out for whales that could be stranded in the Davao Gulf.Netizens shared video clips of local officials using a backhoe to drag the carcass of the whale to shore.",1
"Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) Chair Patricia Licuanan on Monday said she would comply with President Duterte’s order for her to stop attending Cabinet meetings but she would continue her work as head of the commission.In a statement, Licuanan confirmed that she received a text message from Cabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco Jr. on Sunday relaying Mr. Duterte’s instructions that she stop showing up in his Cabinet meetings starting Dec. 5.Also barred from attending Cabinet meetings was Vice President Leni Robredo, prompting her to resign as chair of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council.Evasco cited Robredo and Licuanan’s “irreconcilable differences” with the Duterte administration as the reason for the President’s decision not to allow the two women to attend the Cabinet meetings.“I assured Secretary Evasco that I would comply. In the meantime, I will continue my work as chair of CHEd,” said Licuanan, whose fixed term does not end until 2018.

"real or artificial?It’s not possible to say that real or artificial Christmas trees are better.Both natural and fake trees have an environmental impact. Most people don’t know, but artificial trees have a slightly larger negative impact, requiring more energy, polluting and even posing potential health hazards.The Pros and Cons of ArtificialGuilt. Many have made it the sole reason to invest in an artificial tree. The thought of cutting down a new tree each year can put a damper on the holidays for some.Also, cost, convenience and environmental impact are other reasons consumers opt for an artificial tree.Given the current economic climate, artificial trees may be especially appealing for their investment value when compared with the recurrent, annual expense of a real Christmas tree. Their convenience is also appealing to consumers as they don’t need watering, don’t leave pine needles all over the floor and transportation from tree farm to home isn’t an issue.But many experts believe artificial trees actually have a greater negative environmental impact when all aspects of their life cycle are considered.Today’s artificial trees are typically manufactured with metal and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a non-biodegradable, petroleum-derived plastic. In addition, many older varieties may contain lead, used as a stabilizer in the manufacturing process.Despite their PVC contents, artificial trees are non-recyclable and non-biodegradable, meaning they will sit in a landfill for centuries after disposal.Furthermore, approximately 85 percent of artificial trees sold in the U.S. are imported from China, according to the National Christmas Tree Association (NCTA), adding to their overall environmental footprint.The Pros and Cons of RealApproximately 33 million real Christmas trees are sold in North America each year, according to the U.S. EPA. Luckily, about 93 percent of those trees are recycled through more than 4,000 available recycling programs.Also known as “treecycling,” the act of recycling a Christmas tree is a leading reason many experts agree they are more environmentally friendly than their plastic counterparts.Treecycling is an easy way to return a renewable and natural source back to the environment instead of disposing it in a landfill, where decomposition rates are slowed due to lack of oxygen.Christmas trees are recycled into mulch and used in landscaping and gardening or chipped and used for playground material, hiking trails, paths and walkways. They can be used for beachfront erosion prevention, lake and river shoreline stabilization and fish and wildlife habitat.A single farmed tree absorbs more than 1 ton of CO2 throughout its lifetime. With more than 350 million real Christmas tress growing in U.S. tree farms alone, you can imagine the yearly amount of carbon sequestering associated with the trees. Additionally, each acre of trees produces enough oxygen for the daily needs of 18 people.",1
"A consumers group is urging a committee in the House of Representatives to look into the importation of allegedly substandard building products into the country.In a statement, United Filipino Consumers and Commuters (UFFC) President Rodolfo Javellana Jr. asked Rep. Ferjenel Biron of Iloilo — who leads the House Trade and Industry Committee — to conduct a probe into the matter.“In the interest and protection of the Filipino consumers against uncertified and possible substandard/hazardous construction materials, may we humbly request your trade and commerce committee to conduct an urgent inquiry or investigation on the matter,” the statement quoted the letter dated January 31.Javellana said, “The Filipino people would end up losing their hard-earned money, homes and worse, their lives once a powerful earthquake or a huge flood happens.”The UFFC was reacting to the importation of 20,000 metric tons of steel bars from China at the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority Port.“However, last December 8, 2016, its import commodity clearance was recalled/withdrawn by the very government agency that issued it, the Department of Trade and Industry’s Bureau of Philippine Standards, to make sure the cargo is compliant with law on its traceability, quality and safety,” the letter said.“But as of December 19, truckloads of the shipment were illegally withdrawn/sold to the market,” it added.",1
"Thousands of public schoolteachers might go on leave should the Duterte administration walk back on its promise to increase their salaries, the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) warned on Friday.Benjamin Valbuena, ACT national chair, said the government faced more protests if it failed to adjust the salaries of the country’s more than 600,000 public schoolteachers.Valbuena said the increase was necessary, especially with the expected rise in the prices of basic commodities due to the implementation of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act.The group issued the warning two days after Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said the salary increase of teachers might have to take a back seat to the administration’s more pressing projects.On Friday, ACT staged a protest at the Department of Budget and Management office in Manila to denounce Diokno’s statement and to call for his resignation.Liberal Party (LP) senators also called out Diokno for slamming the door on the salary increase of teachers, describing his statement as “insensitive and heartless.”The senators said that if the budget department was able to find funds to double the pay of military and uniformed personnel, there was no reason why it could not do so for teachers.“It’s not certainly the way to treat our public schoolteachers, who have been seeking government’s help for higher salaries and additional benefits so they can live decently,” LP president Sen. Francis Pangilinan said in a statement on Friday.Minority Leader Sen. Franklin Drilon also said there was no reason for Diokno to “whine” about the cost of increasing teachers’ pay since it was able to produce funds for the pay hike of uniformed personnel.“Instead of slamming the doors on the plea of the teachers, Secretary Diokno should use his wise judgment and skills to find the funds and put money where it is most needed. Investments in the country’s human resources, especially our teachers, can never go wrong,” said Drilon.On Tuesday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque announced that Mr. Duterte might double the salary of teachers. But he corrected himself on Thursday, saying that teachers’ salaries might rise but would not be doubled.Teachers earn a monthly salary ranging from P19,000 to P43,000.",1
"Even with the stalled peace talks, the government’s plan to forge lasting peace with Moro rebels is moving forward, with President Duterte naming the 21 members of the body that will draft the new enabling law for the Bangsamoro.Top Moro Islamic Liberation Front leaders Ghadzali Jaafar and Mohagher Iqbal, former Mayor Hussin Amin of Jolo, Sulu, and lawyer Firdausi Abbas are among the 21 members of the new and expanded Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC), the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process said on Friday.The BTC is the body tasked to craft the new Bangsamoro enabling law as part of the implementation process of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed between the Philippine government and the MILF in March 2014.“This will signal the start of the work to come up with an inclusive Bangsamoro law that will truly reflect and address the clamor for a genuine political autonomy for the Bangsamoro people in Mindanao,” Secretary Jesus Dureza, the presidential adviser on the peace process, said in a statement.The government has set a deadline for the BTC to submit the draft to Congress by July for deliberations and ratification.Earlier, Dureza said the old Bangsamoro Basic Law, which failed to be enacted as a law by the previous Congress, would probably be the basic document of the new enabling law.",1
"Public disapproval of constitutional revision and federalism is no reason to stop moves to amend the 1987 Constitution, according to the spokesperson for the Consultative Committee that drafted a proposed federal charter for the Duterte administration.Conrado Generoso told a Senate hearing on Tuesday that public sentiment about revising the Constitution and adopting federalism was bound to change in the coming days, as the country had just begun discussions on the proposal.A Pulse Asia poll conducted from June 15 to June 21 found that 67 percent of Filipinos disapproved of the amendment of the 1987 Constitution, while 62 percent opposed the proposal for a shift to federalism.Change in public pulse“The consultative committee has just finished its draft, and the discussion, presentation, consultation and debate have just begun. So we would imagine it would only be in the coming weeks and months that the public pulse would change,” Generoso said at the Senate inquiry into proposals for the amendment of the Constitution.“To suggest therefore that the proposals should be dropped entirely because there is not yet a majority supporting it might be wrong,” he said.Candidates for political positions don’t drop out of the race just because they rank low in polls in the beginning, he added.Minority lawmakers in the House of Representatives, however, expect more Filipinos to oppose constitutional revision and the introduction of federalism as the people realize that the proposal will only serve politicians’ vested interests.Commenting on the Pulse Asia poll, Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano said in a statement that the absence of public clamor and lack of knowledge about the proposal rendered the efforts for the amendment of the Constitution for a shift to federalism “inorganic.”“Clearly, there is no public clamor. Worse, the people do not have the capacity and understanding, as of the moment, to engage in the process of Charter change. This attempt is premature,” Alejano said.Vested interestsMakabayan bloc Reps. Antonio Tinio and France Castro said the Duterte administration should expect more Filipinos to oppose the proposal, as “vested interests” behind it continued to be exposed.Rep. Ariel Casilao, also a member of the Makabayan bloc, called on Malacañang and its allies to take the cue from the Pulse Asia poll and abandon attempts to tinker with the Constitution.Deputy Speaker Gwendolyn Garcia said on Monday that the House would give priority to the proposal after the resumption of sessions next Monday, fueling suspicion that President Duterte’s majority allies would declare a House-alone constituent assembly that would amend the Constitution.The Senate has rejected a constituent assembly, unless the voting on proposed amendments to the Constitution would be separate.On Tuesday, Sen. Panfilo Lacson described the talk of a House-alone constituent assembly in graphic terms on Twitter.“This doltish notion of revising the Charter via Con-ass (constituent assembly), Con-con (constitutional convention), or even people’s initiative without the [Senate’s] participation in a bicameral system such as ours smells worse than week-old shit [in] an unflushed toilet of a congressman suffering from colon cancer,” Lacson said.Lacson did not mention any names, but Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez earlier said the House could sit as a constituent assembly and propose changes to the Constitution even without the Senate.But at Tuesday’s hearing at the Senate, the country’s top legal experts said the House alone could not propose revisions to the Constitution, and that the two chambers of Congress must vote separately on the proposals.Former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr. said both houses of Congress must introduce resolutions calling for a constituent assembly for the process to commence.Separate voting is also needed because, otherwise, the House would just overwhelm the Senate.Former Chief Justice Reynato Puno, head of the consultative committee that drafted a proposed federal Charter, agreed with Pimentel that the House alone could not amend the Constitution.Retired Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Nachura said there should be separate voting.Puno’s committee, on the President’s request, revised the transitory provisions of the draft federal charter to cut the terms of the President and Vice President Leni Robredo, bar them from seeking reelection in 2022, and authorize elections for the selection of a transitional president and transitional vice president.But at Tuesday’s Senate hearing, University of the Philippines professor Gene Pilapil slammed the revision as a “reverse power grab” or “impeachment by a new constitution.”Pilapil said the “stunt” was retrogressive, as it undermines the mandate of the 16 million Filipinos who voted for Mr. Duterte and the 14 million who voted for Robredo.Marcos for president?Former Chief Justice Hilario Davide also criticized the revision, which does not bar Mr. Duterte from running for transitional president.Davide said he believed the President would choose former Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as his running mate and they would surely win.Marcos would then be able to run for President in the federal government, Davide said.",1

"Pope Francis continues to send shockwaves to Catholics and others worldwide with his radical actions and pronouncements, many of which break away from centuries-old Vatican dogma and practices.In his latest move, Pope Francis announced that he is delegating the papal duties to selected cardinals in various continents. His first appointment is Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, the young and charismatic bishop from the Philippines who was on the short list of candidates during Pope Francis’ election last year. Tagle will be the new pope for the Asian continent. Pope Francis is expected to announce the other popes for Africa, South America, North America, Antartica and Australia in the next few weeks. He is not appointing a pope for Europe since The Vatican is already in the European continent.The Vatican said that this new arrangement will bring the papacy closer to the people around the world.Soon after the announcement, The Boston Globe published this in-depth interview with Cardinal Tagle, calling him the Philippine Pope Francis.See related article: “Pope Francis Scolds President Obama.”",0
"Realizing that in order to win in the general elections, presumptive Republican presidential nominee is leaving no stone unturned to reach out to all possible voting blocs, including the Filipino Americans.Filipino Americans have traditionally been socially conservative. In the 2004 U.S. Presidential elections, Republican president George W. Bush won the Filipino American vote over John Kerry by nearly a two-to-one ratio, which followed strong support in the 2000 election. However, in 2008, Filipino Americans voted majority Democratic, with 50% to 58% of the community voting for President Barack Obama and 42% to 46% voting for Senator John McCain. The 2008 election marked the first time that a majority of Filipino Americans voted for a Democrat presidential candidate.Naturally, Trump wants to win back the Filipino American vote.Today, he posted a selfie taken at the penthouse suite of the Trump Towers in New York. In his photo, he is shown gobbling down a bowl of dinuguan, a traditional Filipino dish made of pork and pork blood. In his comment, he said, “I love dinuguan. I love Filipinos, and Filipinos love me!”When asked by his wife Melania what he was eating, Trump said, “chocolate soup.”",0
" Police officers who drink and drive and use their patrol cars for practice driving and going to bars, be warned.President Rodrigo Duterte said he was once so enraged over being disobeyed that he slapped and kicked a drunken officer who crashed a police pickup truck newly acquired by Davao City when he was its mayor.Speaking on Monday at ceremonies for the turnover of 26 Mitsubishi Montero SUVs donated by the Japanese government to the Davao City police on Monday, Mr. Duterte reminded officers to “obey orders that are really good for you.”“There was this stupid policeman—drunk … But he drove one of those new Isuzu pickups that I just bought at that time … [and] crashed it,” said Mr. Duterte, who also became known as “The Punisher” for his tough approach to crime.“I slapped him twice and kicked him in the stomach,” he added.SUV donations“I already said that, ‘Do not drive them and practice, especially when you are drunk,’” he said.He said the SUVs donated to the city were “not cheap” and even considered luxury vehicles by ordinary Filipinos and should be well maintained so they could last “for 50 years or more.”The Japanese donation to Davao was part of 100 Monteros for the police in various Philippine cities.In Davao City, Japanese Ambassador Koji Haneda turned over the 26 cars to the Philippine National Police at its Regional Crime Laboratory Office.“They are hard to come by in the lifetime of a city and the one that’s given to you is almost a luxury car to us,” Mr. Duterte said.He said the public would never accept an explanation by the police that they could not respond to an emergency because officers had no cars to use.As a final warning, he said: “I do not want you parking in … I do not want to see policemen, cars, in the entertainment houses.”",1

"The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) today honored the Philippines with another World Heritage Site designation, this time for Torre De Manila. The 46-storey condominium project at Luneta Park in Manila joins Vigan City, in Ilocos Sur in receiving this prestigious designation.The announcement was made by UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova in ceremonies held at the Place de Fontenoy, the U.N. body’s headquarters in Paris.UNESCO’s three-fold mission is to build intercultural understanding, pursue scientific cooperation, and protect freedom of expression. It created the idea of World Heritage to protect sites of outstanding universal value.In her statement, Bokova said:“Torre De Manila is the best example of urban planning, rising from the hallowed ground just steps away from the burial site of the Philippines’ national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal.”“It has withstood a persistent wave of nationalistic uprising while standing tall and firm amid bureaucratic obstacles and political favors. It is a symbol of the indomitable spirit of the Filipinos, and is a testament to the centuries-long divide between the haves and the have-nots.”“Torre De Manila fuses the past with the future, ensuring that the next generation of Filipinos will draw inspiration from the heroism and courage of their heroes as well as the tactless perseverance and resiliency of those who built, or who allowed to build, this monumental heritage never before seen anywhere in ancient and modern times.”Upon hearing the news , Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada declared a non-working holiday for the entire city to allow its citizens to fittingly celebrate this momentous occasion.",0

"Now, it's time to put things into perspective. Let's evaluate what has transpired during the months leading to that fateful day. Let's find relevant information that will shed light in this already-muddled situation.Let's go.TIMELINE: Before the Kidapawan Protest-turned-MassacrePres. Aquino (L) and Sen. Drilon (R)Now, it's time to analyze.Halimbawa, kung ako ang DA at magpo-propose ako ng P2 billion at alam kong 900 million lang ang makukuha ko, e di magpro-propose na lang ako ng P4 billion tapos makakakuha ako ng P2 billion at the end of the day. E di makukuha ko yung gusto ko, di ba?Para-paraan lang 'yan.Let's recap a bit: DA didn't want El Nino funds during the budget hearing stage. Pressed by Senate in Sept, they asked for P 2 billion in October. After budget hearings, they got 900 million and they didn't complain.Then a couple of months later, ""Oh, sh*t! we need 3 billion! OMG!"". GENIUS.26 pesos per poor person for the entire drought!Madamme Governor, aanhin mo ang natira sa calamity fund kung patay na ang kalahati ng North Cotabato bago matapos ang taon? Sarap mong i-water cannon, promise.Bago pa man nagkaroon ng NPA angle, malinaw na pinabayaan ng gobyerno ang mga magsasaka. Iyan ang dahilan kung bakit maaari silang humingi ng tulong sa NPA. Dahil walang pakialam ang gobyerno. Kung mamamatay ka na sa gutom, kakapit ka na talaga sa patalim.Wow, nagbigay din si Anne Curtis! Sige Anne, kahit nagwala ka noon sa bar, pinapatawad na kita.Hehe, salamat. :-)Posted by The Thinking Pinoy on Monday, April 4, 2016NoCot Gov. Mendoza said donations to LGUs are an insult to her.Learn more:...Posted by The Thinking Pinoy on Saturday, April 2, 2016The blaming game started right after the Kidapawan Massacre. Farmers blame the government, the latter blames NPA communists. To shed light on the issue, Thinking Pinoy did some research about everything that happened before the evening of March 29th, or the day the protest started, with sources cited for easy verification.

Provincial agriculturist admits P4 million cloud seeding produced little rain. [ Inquirer TP has done a Google search for “North Cotabato Food Aid” articles dated between 01 February 2016 and 30 March 2016, and there was none. Politicians in general love to gain publicity when they conduct such projects, so the absence of any mention about North Cotabato food aid distributions since mid-February 2016 likely implies that weren’t any.500 Farmers assembled in front of NFA Kidapawan, marking the start of the Kidapawan protests [ GMANews ]., both Malacanang and the Cotabato Provincial Government knew that El Nino is already happening in as early as April 2015, as shown by the declaration of states of calamity in two NoCot towns.PAGASA also informed the government that the already-devastating drought will become even more devastating. In as early as July 2015, PAGASA warned us that this will be the worst El Nino, ever. Of course, the public expects that this will prompt government to put up a disaster mitigation plan., the Senate discovered that there was no mention of any El Nino funding in Malacanang's proposed 2016 budget, as pointed out by Senator Drilon in September. Malacanang's negligence is clear at this point. El Nino is a major natural catastrophe, yet they did not even bother to allocate funds for it.Regardless, Malacanang inserted a P 2 billion proposal in responss, and DA eventually got P 900 million from the final 2016 budget, passed by year-end 2015. The Senate also appears to be blamed partly for this, because they provided less than half of what DA asked for.: So far, we can see negligence from Malacanang and, at least at first glance, negligence from the Senate. Note, however, that for now, I only partly blame the Senate because there are many factors in budget deliberations that I still don't have information about. Besides, Malacanang could have easily proposed a larger budget in anticipation of the lower final allocation.But Malacanang did not do that.Why? Because even by late October, it's clear that the government is still downplaying PAGASA warnings and empirical data from the NoCot LGUs.Just like what Roxas did during the Yolanda crisis, where he brought to Tacloban his entire entourage MINUS PAGASA personnel.Morons.But wait! It gets more ridiculous., El Nino was already at its peak when DA suddenly discovered some time in late January to early February that P 900 million is not enough: they wanted a total of P 3 billion instead. But 2016 budget deliberations are over, making that request harder to fulfill.Around the same time, NoCot declared a state of calamity, enabling them to tap onto whatever calamity fund the province has or had. And when they did tap that fund, P3 million was also earmarked as supplement to the cloud seeding budget, since DA can afford only two week's worth because lack of national-level funds.And despite the millions spent for cloud seeding - that lasted for barely over a month -! Rice takes 4 months to grow, corn takes at least two. One month of water and nothing afterwards is a good as none. That, is, NoCot's P4 million simply went up in smoke.NFA sells Regular Milled Rice to government agencies at P23 a kilo [ NFA ], so P4 million can buy 173,913 kilos of rice. At the most, there were 6,000 farmers in the Kidapawan Protest, so that's at least 28 kilos per protesting farmer.Even if it still isn't enough, it's still 15 times betterthan the 3-kilos-per-quarter promise [ Interaksyon ], right?But no, we can't do that, dahil pinambili na ng asin ang P4 million [ Businessworld ]., NoCot allocated a paltry P14 million out of the P238 million calamity fund. NoCot has 1.2 million [ PSA ] with poverty incidence at 44.8 percent [ NAPC ], i.e. 540,000 are below the poverty line.Assuming that the P14 million will be ENTIRELY for food aid to poor constituents, that amounts to a budget of justBy mid-February, NoCot residents are starting to feel severe hunger. That is expected given the fifth point above. Initially, Thinking Pinoy even tried to google NoCot food aid projects to no avail, but after seeing that budget allocation, it is hardly surprising.Gov. Mendoza, the PNP, and even Malacanang said NPA coaxed these starving farmers to form the Kidapawan Highway blockade.But Malacanang and Mendoza conveniently forgot that they have neglected the people of North Cotabato for so long. NPA or no NPA, they have been starving for months. They are facing the certainty of death from hunger. The two even had the gall to accuse the farmers of using their children as human shields [ Philstar ].Did Malacanang expect the farmers to hire housemaids who can watch over their kids while they beg for food?Four days have passed since the bloody April 1 dispersal, yet the government has yet to send even one bag of rice to North Cotabato!In the absence of government action, donations from private residents from neighbouring towns like Davao City and Tagum City came in. Celebrities even pitched in.After the delivery of said private donations, this is what Gov. Mendoza had to say:The government was incompetent and negligent from top to bottom, from start to end.Of course, it'll blame communists, because it's the easiest_____Did you like this post?

"Malacañang on Wednesday squelched speculation that President Rodrigo Duterte would pardon retired Army Maj. Gen.

Edgardo Osorio, to life imprisonment for the kidnapping and illegal detention of Karen Empeño and Sherlyn Cadapan in 2006.“It’s the government that jailed Palparan and it will be the government that will ensure that justice will be given to the victims,” Roque said.Empeño and Cadapan were seized in June 2006 by armed men in Hagonoy, Bulacan province.The two UP students were last seen being tortured in a military camp.Mockery of the lawIn a statement, rights group Hustisya said the AFP was making a mockery of the law by refusing to immediately commit Palparan to the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) after his conviction.“The AFP is making a fool out of the victims and even the courts by saying they’re still waiting for a commitment order. The court decision is the order itself,” said Evangeline Hernandez, chair of Hustisya, an organization of victims and relatives of victims of human rights violations.Hustisya said Palparan was still being held at the Army custodial center in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City, three days after his conviction.The group said the military was “making all kinds of excuses” in trying to keep Palparan in its custody.According to Hustisya, Palparan’s counsel asked that he be allowed to remain in Fort Bonifacio to attend to other pending cases against him, which the judge denied on grounds that doing so would violate Supreme Court guidelines to immediately transfer a convict to a national penitentiary.Special treatment“Palparan should be brought to NBP the soonest. He has enjoyed years of special treatment in Fort Bonifacio, it’s time that justice be served [to] the fullest by treating him like a common criminal,” Hernandez said.Erlinda Cadapan, Sherlyn’s mother, said the AFP was perpetrating “impunity” by keeping Palparan.“The delay of his transfer at the NBP reeks of special treatment. He has been proven guilty, and as long as he remains in an Army camp, that is impunity,” she said.Warning of same fateOne of the President’s archcritics, jailed Sen. Leila de Lima, warned the President and his associates that they could meet the same fate as Palparan for their alleged human rights violations.“No matter how brave you are now and how much you disrespect the human rights of Filipinos—including their right to life and freedom—you will be judged and made to answer for your wrongs,” said De Lima, who is facing what she describes as trumped-up drug charges.She said the conviction of Palparan should open the eyes of people in power and their minions who act as if they were the law.“Remember that all those who commit wrong will be held to account at the proper time,” said De Lima, who was the justice secretary when the case was filed against Palparan.The verdict, she said, was “a welcome respite in our long and tedious struggle against impunity in this country.”",1
"President Donald Trump says he’s “looking forward” to meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House Wednesday.Trump says in a tweet that they “will be talking about many things, including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade.”The president is set to host Cook in the Oval Office a day after Cook attended Trump’s state dinner Tuesday night for French President Emmanuel Macron.Trump has had a fraught relationship with the electronics company, criticizing Apple on Twitter over its decision not to cooperate with law enforcement on breaching its phone encryption and the size of the screens on iPhones.But Trump has praised the company’s planned investment in the U.S. after the passage of last year’s tax cuts.",1
"Most everyone is familiar with postpartum depression which affects 10-20 percent of childbearing women. But doctors at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine have discovered a rare form of depression that afflicts individuals other than the women giving birth. Amid the frenzy over the impending birth of the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, doctors announced that the first patient they have ever diagnosed with this rare depression was no less than Prince Harry.Doctors are calling this disease “prepartum depression,” apparently caused by panic or anxiety over an impending birth of a child. Hospital records show that Prince Harry has been suffering from this condition for 9 months now. It began immediately after the announcement that the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant.The Senior Psychiatrist at the Centre, speaking to paparazzis camped outside the facility, said that Prince Harry’s depression was caused by the fact that the younger brother of Prince William has been “deposed” from his spot in the ascendancy to the British throne. Prior to the pregnancy of Kate Middleton, Prince Harry was 3rd in line to inherit the throne, next to Prince Charles and Prince William. Prince Harry was reportedly resorting to drugs and alcohol, as well as behavior not befitting of royalty, since he learned of the arrival of the Royal Baby.Doctors are closely monitoring Prince Harry’s condition, but would not confirm whether the Prince’s depression would automatically convert to postpartum depression once the Royal Baby is born.",0
"The Office of the Ombudsman is eyeing completion next month of closures of all 50 “illegal” dumps, which were the subject of a complaint earlier filed before the office.Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon Gerard Mosquera, who leads the office’s environmental team, told reporters on Monday that they have closed down 29 dumps in six regions.“Fifty LGUs [ocal government units] were charged for violation of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act. We have been conducting public hearings over the last six months. So we go to the illegal [dumps] and we physically close [them]. So far we have closed down a total of 29 illegal [ones] in six regions across the country.So we have 21 to go, and we will complete all closures of all 50 [sites] by November of this year,” Mosquera said in an interview at the sidelines of an inter-agency workshop on high-profile environmental crimes.According to the official, they have been to Region III, Region IV-A, Region V, Region VI and Region VII.“Next week, we will be in Regions 11, 12 and 13 in Mindanao. We will have our public hearings in Davao so we will close a total of seven illegal [dumps] next week,” Mosquera said.The Environmental Ombudsman Team investigates complaints filed against any public official, employee, office or agency mandated to protect the environment and conserve natural resources.It can also recommend imposition of the appropriate penalties and/or filing of cases.The office is conducting a fact-finding investigation of allegedly illegal dumps as part of a national campaign to ensure compliance with Republic Act 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, which prohibits the use of open dumps for disposal of solid waste.In February, the National Solid Waste Management Commission filed a complaint, which prompted the Environmental Ombudsman to give local officials 30 days to submit an explanation as well as a Safe Closure and Rehabilitation Plan.",1
"PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte should insist on the Philippines’ right to exploit the resource-rich West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) when he visits China this week, with the Malampaya field off Palawan set to run out of natural gas in less than a decade, a neophyte senator said.Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said the impending depletion of the Malampaya Gas Field – one of Luzon’s primary power sources – and the forthcoming expiration of the Malampaya service contract meant that the government should be looking for new natural gas sources in other areas including the West Philippine Sea.“We will need to further discuss the prospects of our oil and gas industries in relation to the exploration of the West Philippine Sea, where abundant energy resources sit untapped beneath contested waters,” Gatchalian said in a privilege speech delivered last week.Gatchalian, who heads the Senate energy committee, said reducing the country’s dependence on foreign energy sources would be determined by how the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte handles the dispute over West Philippine Sea.Duterte is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and other Chinese officials when he visits Beijing this week.“I hope this administration’s emerging independent foreign policy agenda will also serve as a catalyst for achieving Philippine energy independence, by vigorously upholding and defending our exclusive sovereign rights to explore and develop resources in the West Philippine Sea,” Gatchalian said.The Department of Energy earlier told the Senate energy committee that the country would need additional sources of energy ahead of the scheduled shutdown of old power plants and the depletion of the Malampaya field in 2024.Malampaya fuels three power plants generating a combined 2,700 megawatts of electricity.Nuclear powerThe Energy department is also looking at nuclear power and has raised the possibility of reviving the $2.3-billion Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) constructed during the time of former president Ferdinand Marcos.Senators Joseph Victor Ejercito, Juan Edgardo Angara and Nancy Binay have expressed openness to the idea but insisted that a thorough study be made first.Gatchalian is opposed to the idea of reviving the BNPP, saying it is tainted by corruption and is too old to use. It is also close to an earthquake fault.The energy committee chief however clarified that he was not against nuclear power. But the government must use the latest technology available, he said.Gatchalian, in his speech, also called for legislation that would help clear roadblocks in existing laws that hinder progress in the energy sector.The senator has filed a bill that will significantly cut red tape involved in power infrastructure projects.Based on the data from PhilHydro Association, Inc., the regulatory process for a run-of-river hydro plant could take 1,340 days. The proponent of the plant will have to secure at least 359 signatures from 74 regulatory agencies and attached bureaus.“They will also have to make sense of 20 different laws governing the entire process as they attempt to accomplish 43 different contracts, certifications, endorsements and licenses,” Gatchalian said.",1

"The West End revival of “Miss Saigon” is scheduled to open on May 3, 2014 at the Prince Edward Theatre in London. The new Cameron Mackintosh production coincides with the musical’s 25th anniversary next year.Set in 1975 during the final days of the American occupation of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), the musical tells the epic love story between Chris, an American G.I., and Kim, a young Vietnamese bargirl, and is loosely based on Giacomo Puccini’s “Madame Butterfly.” It features music by Claude-Michel Schönberg with lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr. and Alain Boublil, adapted from the original French lyrics by Boublil.Mackintosh has announced that 17-year old Eva Noblezada, a Charlotte, North Carolina native, has been cast to play the lead role of Kim. Noblezada currently attends the NorthWest School of the Arts in Charlotte. The plan is for her to perform four shows a week when “Miss Saigon” opens, with understudies covering the rest of the performances so she can keep up with her studies.The Adobo Chronicles learned from inside sources that a 21-year old transgender will train and rehearse as understudy for Noblezada. The sources declined to reveal the name or ethnicity of the understudy. They, however, said that the transgender actress looks and sounds like a young Lea Salonga who originated the role of Kim when it first opened in London.It will be recalled that when “Miss Saigon” opened on Broadway, the show was met with protests from Asian Americans because it cast a Caucasian, Jonathan Pryce, in the role of the Engineer. This time, Mackintosh has cast a Filipino actor, Jon Jon Briones, to play the all-important role.Entertainment critics have speculated that the casting of a non-Caucasian for the role of the Engineer and a transgender understudy for the role of Kim, is the production’s way of sending a message that the new “Miss Saigon” is quite sensitive to issues of racial and sexual diversity.Upon learning of the news about the transgender understudy, a small group of LGBT activists held a peaceful demonstration in front of the Prince Edward Theatre yesterday, chanting “We’re here, we’re Queer, we’re celebrating with our peer!”",0
"There are many company CEOs who bitch, as we do, about the politicians that we have. When they talk among themselves, they compare notes on how this or that politician is such a low life — for indeed a good many of these politicians may look so respectable on the outside, but their brains are really full of garbage. I know of a CEO who carries extra medicine for his high blood pressure whenever he has an appointment with this Congressman or that Mayor. Another CEO always claims that he spends a long time in the shower after any lunch or dinner with any government person — he says it is a good way of feeling after being in touch with filth. I, of course, don't know if he is just being hyperbolic and joking, but it should give you idea that there are CEOs who are sick and tired of the prevailing situation.That many of the CEOs wish they just be left alone by government and if they have to deal with govt, it is just to pay the proper taxes is also a fact. Unfortunately, the Philippines is not a level playing field for business, especially big business. Laws, both national and local, can be so unpredictable and selective, giving this preferential treatment or that concession, and if you don't watch it, you might just wake up one morning in a very uncompetitive position. This randomness of laws is one reason why Intel said goodbye to PHL; 27,000 locals lost their jobs when Intel left. You could say the same thing when Kimberly-Clark, Johnson & Johnson, 3M, and a horde of others, who all pulled out their manufacturing facilities; they are now either in Indonesia, Vietnam, or Thailand. These companies are just now maintaining sales and marketing offices in Philippines, and we are now importing the products that used to be manufactured here.PNoy got something correct: kung walang corrupt, walang mahirap. Unfortunately, he thought of it only as an advertising gimmick. With his selective justice, we now know he actually didn't intend to pursue the idea.As one blog said: ""Poverty is the actual cause of ruin of a country, not to mention the desire of its ruler and officers to amass wealth and possessions, by any means. Corruption undermines the nation's well-being. For corruption to thrive it needs self-centred and selfish politicians, suffering from obsession of grasping and accumulating wealth supported by businessmen who feed them for their selfish needs. To recover the bribes these businessmen often hoard their goods to get more profit out of them by creating scarcity and by indulging in black-marketing or get contracts by unreasonable means causing a loss to the public.""This is the reason why UN came up with Millennium Development Goals (MDG) to highlight that governance is very critical. It includes targets to reduce bribery and corruption. But see, MDG cannot not now be found in the lips of PNoy and his ilks; he had a glowing SONA, but he didn't mention that they didn't meet the MDG targets. Thus, his achievements are all vacuousness, the same emptiness the candidates for 2016 are showing.I don't understand why people are not scared. ASEAN Integration is just around the corner. If Pinoys continue with their apathy, they will find themselves very much under the ASEAN bus — in three years, I guarantee, and situations will be much worse after that. We have to be angry now, people.-----------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"(Second of three parts)CEBU CITY—Online child pornography has become a “cottage industry” in isolated parts of the country, according to authorities.Parents are lured by the easy money while some children are left believing that there is nothing wrong with what they are doing since there is no actual sexual contact.Data from the International Justice Mission (IJM), a US-based nonprofit that fights human trafficking and child exploitation, showed that more than 300 children in the Philippines have been rescued since 2011 after law enforcers stepped up their campaign against cyberpornography.At least 133 suspects nationwide have been arrested as of April 2018—77 percent of whom were parents, relatives, and close family friends of the victims.All over PhilippinesAccording to John Tanagho, IJM Cebu field office director, online sexual exploitation of children happens all over the Philippines, especially in poor and isolated areas.But he lamented that law enforcers fighting cyberpornography had been active only in a few places",1

"The Manila Electric Co. (Meralco), the country’s largest power distributor, on Friday announced that there will be an increase in the rate for a typical household this February 2017 by P0.92 per kilowatthour, bringing the overall rate to P9.00 per kWh.The increase this month results from an upward movement in the generation charge.A 7-year low overall rate of P8.09 per kWh in January 2017, Meralco said, would bring the running average overall residential rate for 2017 to P8.55 per kWh.This is still P2.17 per kWh lower than the 2014 average rate of P10.72 per kWh, and P0.89 per kWh lower than the 2015 average rate of P9.44 per kWh, approximating the 2016 average of P8.50 per kWh.Normalization of capacity charges and lower dispatch have caused generation rate increase.January 2017’s record low generation charge since October 2004 of P3.70 per kWh largely stemmed from a reduction in capacity fees arising from the annual reconciliation of outage allowances that is done at the end of each year, under contracts approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC).The reduction in capacity fees every January represents savings immediately passed on to consumers by way of lower electricity rates.The capacity fees, particularly of Pagbilao and Ilijan, returned to normal levels this February, pushing up the generation charge by P0.62 per kWh from P4.32 per kWh.Contributing to the adjustment was the lower dispatch of Power Suppy Agreements (PSAs) and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) because of a variety of scheduled and forced outages.Calaca, Masinloc, Quezon Power and First Gas-Santa Rita underwent scheduled shutdowns, while the Ilijan power plant was isolated by transmission line troubles by Typhoon Nina.Demand in January 2017 was also about 400 megawats lower compared to the December 2016 level.Remainder of the increase in the generation charge was caused by higher fuel prices, partly from the quarterly repricing of Malampaya natural gas, and a slight depreciation of the peso against the US dollar.The share of PSAs this month stood at 38.6 percent, while the share of IPPs was at 38.1 percent.Overall charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) decreased by P0.25 per kWh in January 2017, mitigating further increases in the generation charge.The share of WESM purchases in Meralco’s total requirements went up from 21.8 percent to 23.2 percent.This month, there was an increase in the transmission charge of residential customers by P0.15 per kWh because of an increase in Power Delivery Service Charges caused by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines’ (NGCP) implementation of higher Interim Maximum Allowable Revenue (iMAR).Higher Ancillary Service Charges also contributed to the increase in the transmission charge.Taxes and other charges similarly went up by a combined amount of around P0.15 per kWh.Meralco’s distribution, supply and metering charges, meanwhile, have remained unchanged for 19 months, after these registered reductions in July 2015.The power distributor has reiterated that it does not earn from the pass-through charges, such as the generation and transmission charges.Payment for the generation charge goes to the power suppliers, while payment for the transmission charge goes to the NGCP.Meanwhile, Meralco said over 42,000 franchise customers are now in Kuryente Load (KLoad), Meralco’s prepaid electricity service.Its prepaid electricity service is an easy and affordable way for Meralco customers to monitor electricity consumption through mobile phone text notifications and manage electricity expenses with budget-friendly load denominations for as low as P100.Another useful feature of Kuryente Load is that because the system runs on the latest “smart” meters, Meralco can detect outages instantly, allowing for faster power restoration in times of need.Recently, it announced that it was ready to accept an additional 100,000 prepaid customers that was approved by ERC for this year.Aside from Manila, Pasig City and parts of Rizal province, KLoad is now also available in Mandaluyong City, and coming soon to Makati City.By the end of 2017, Meralco plans to bring KLoad to the following areas: Quezon City, Caloocan City, San Juan City, Marikina City, Taguig City, Pasay City and Pateros town.Based on Meralco’s consumer research, customers who shifted from postpaid to prepaid are able to effectively monitor their consumption daily via SMS and as a result, they have saved an average of 20 percent on electricity consumption.This translates to total savings of around P300 per customer.VOLTAIRE PALAÑA",1
