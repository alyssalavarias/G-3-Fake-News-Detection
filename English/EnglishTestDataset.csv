"Pope Francis arrived at Villamor Airbase in Manila on Thursday for a 5-day visit to this predominantly Roman Catholic Asian nation.The pope was greeted with all the pomp and formality afforded any foreign state visitor or dignitary. He was met by no less than Philippine President NoyNoy Aquino.The welcome ceremony began with the playing of the national anthems of the Philippines and the Vatican.Alas, organizers of the ceremony played the wrong anthem for the Vatican. They played the national anthem of Italy. (Click on video clip above to listen to the correct national anthem of the Vatican).Someone forgot to tell the organizers that the Vatican, although located in Rome, Italy, is a separate state, and as such has its own national anthem.The pope immediately noticed the error and whispered to President Aquino, “It’s the wrong anthem!” Aquino then blushed in shame and was visibly upset at the gaffe.Aquino tried to make up by shouting ‘Viva il Papa!’ immediately after the anthem was played.Quick thinking, Mr. President!",0
"The Senate will begin on Thursday an investigation of the recent upsurge in drug killings by the police, including that of 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos.A four-page resolution of the majority bloc, which was firmed up after 14 of its 17 members met in a caucus on Sunday night, expressed the “sense of the Senate to condemn” the slaying of Delos Santos.The resolution directed the appropriate committee to conduct the inquiry to determine the accountability of the Philippine National Police “in the unnecessary and unjustified deaths and/or killings.”Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III said on Monday that the investigation would be referred on Tuesday to the committee on public order and dangerous drugs chaired by Sen. Panfilo Lacson.Lacson said that on Thursday’s hearing, he would invite Delos Santos’ father and witnesses now under the custody of Sen. Risa Hontiveros.Among those to be invited are PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa; National Capital Region Director Oscar Albayalde; Criminal Investigation and Detection Group Director Roel Obusan; Caloocan policemen; barangay officials; those who have control over the CCTV at the scene of the incident; officials of the PNP Internal Affairs Service, Department of Justice and the National Bureau of Investigation.Majority appalledThe majority bloc was appalled at the spate of killings in antidrug operations on Aug. 15 and 16 in Bulacan province and in Manila where in a span of 24 hours a total of 60 drug suspects were killed. On Aug. 18, another 13 were added to the list of fatalities.The senators noted the killing of Delos Santos, who police officers from Precinct 7 along bloc 7 Riverside in Barangay Baesa, Caloocan City, alleged had tried to run away and had shot at them on Wednesday.“Eyewitness accounts and CCTV footage, however, belie the narrative of the police involved as these reveal that Kian delos Santos had already been apprehended by the police, and that he was forced to hold a gun and run with a gun. Delos Santos was then shot,” the resolution said.The senators said the government should “always ensure that no innocent lives are unnecessarily lost and that those within the ranks of the police or any government agency should be held fully accountable for any crime or offense.”“Senators whether in the majority or the minority should set aside our differences and unite behind a more vocal effort to oppose extrajudicial killings,” Sen. Francis Pangilinan said in a text message.No controlSen. Antonio Trillanes IV said the majority resolution showed that President Duterte no longer had control over the Senate.“They cannot look the other way. They can see the people’s anger,” Trillanes said of Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, which had received resounding approval in public opinion surveys.Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said the PNP should justify its P1-billion fund request for its antidrug operations, saying the congressional budget hearings would provide a chance for oversight to determine where it gets its “financial ammunition” for its nationwide campaign.In a statement, Recto said Congress must first question the PNP on its implementation of Oplan Double Barrel Reloaded before reloading the campaign with funds. “It must not write a blank check,” he said.Sen. Grace Poe said Mr. Duterte’s campaign should not turn into a competition among police stations for the most drug kills.“If this is a contest, the killings will not end. There will be no winner,” Poe said during a visit in Lucena City on Monday.",1
"Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano’s disclosure of “red lines” regarding the country’s ongoing dispute with China over the West Philippine Sea are “nothing more than hollow public relations propaganda with no action or results to back them up,” an opposition lawmaker said on Friday.Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano, in a statement, said the imposition of red lines were “ironic considering that the Duterte administration is saying that the Philippines has limited defense capabilities.”“The Duterte administration, with the President himself, recognizes our limited defense capabilities. With such view, it suggests that Secretary Cayetano’s red lines could not be backed up by concrete actions if things come to worst,” he said.Alejano cautioned against the “vague motherhood statements and empty rhetoric” being used by the country’s top diplomat.“By bending their statements, the more will people lose their faith in him and the foreign policy of the President in the West Philippine Sea. The public needs clear, no-nonsense statements with concrete actions to back them up,” he said.Severe consequencesCayetano told a hearing in the House of Representatives last week that the Philippines had laid down four red lines in the West Philippine Sea that China should not cross.A red line is a condition set by a certain party which, when violated, may result to severe consequences, ranging from economic sanctions to military actions imposed by the party that set the condition.These red lines, as announced by Cayetano, are for the Chinese not to reclaim Scarborough Shoal, remove the Philippine Navy’s BRP Sierra Madre from its anchor in Ayungin Shoal, harass soldiers resupplying and conducting repairs on Philippine-occupied islands, and extract natural resources in the West Philippine Sea.Alejano said two of the four red lines had been crossed by China. Filipino troops resupplying the Sierra Madre outpost in Ayungin on May 11 were harassed by the Chinese coast guard and navy, he said.Alejano also said that Chinese fishermen had long been poaching Philippine waters.",1
"Suffice to say, the Yellowtard and Liberal Party-led opposition resorted to “pressure” from international entities early on, in the hope of weaning local support away from president Rodrigo Duterte. Among the entities that have “expressed concern” for the Duterte administration’s alleged extrajudicial killings and alleged no-basis detainment of political enemies (Leila de Lima, anyone) include: The International Criminal Court (ICC), the United Nations (UN) – rapporteur Agnes Callamard is now a household name in the Philippines – and, most recently, a delegation from the Progressive Aliiance and Party of European Socialists.Duterte’s government , for its part, have pretty much been unyielding about what they’ve done for their campaign against drugs. If Duterte wasn’t too keen about the Philippines staying in the UN, not much of a surprise; he even went, one time, as far as threatening to “burn it to the ground”.More recently, however, reports are circulating in local media that Human Rights Watch (HRW) is warning that the Philippines is at risk of being removed from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Expectedly, the Duterte government was again dismissive, if judging by the reactions of both presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella, and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo.Duterte’s critics – HRW among them – are, of course, out there to make a mountain out of a molehill of any issue they can get a hand on, and this one with the UNHRC membership is no exception. At the same time, nobody is asking a simple, yet confronting question: So What if the Philippines is removed from the UNHRC?What does the Philippines stand to lose if it is removed from the UNHRC? How useful has its membership been to it in the first place?At this point, it seems the most somber way to look at this issue – and possibly be a template for future ones that may come up – revolves around a few points:Filipinos’ need for acceptance into “exclusive groups”, and their inordinate obsession with agreeable foreign opinion, are being used against them.Filipinos as a people, have been afflicted with the condition called fear of missing out (FOMO), even before the term was coined to refer to those who can’t seemingly survive without incessantly checking their social media accounts. As a people, they’ve always been wanting for “prestige” and “exclusivity”, because of their innate need to get an advantage on, or put one over, each other.On the other hand, Filipinos are also all too obsessed with agreeable foreign opinion, primarily as a means of being validated as a people. Ironic for a people who are utterly sensitive to criticism, and unwilling to change – especially if such change results in even the slightest bit of discomfort.The UNHRC, having recently elected Saudi Arabia as a member, is, at face value, inconsistent.Why does Saudi Arabia stand out like a sore thumb, as part of the UNHRC? Because there is a general consensus among critics and observers of the UN that, with its appalling human rights record, and historically low regard for women’s rights, the ultra-conservative Islamic kingdom is one of the least qualified to speak about, much less take the lead on, promoting human rights, women’s rights, freedom of religion, and other issues at the forefront of the UN’s advocacies.Is there a flaw in the process of electing members? Is there some sort of “accommodation” being made? Are some of the UNHRC members willing to compromise, because they want something that Saudi Arabia can give? These are questions for another discussion, but suffice to say, a body that appears inconsistent is hardly in a position to dictate what others should do.Yellowtards and the Liberal Party (LP), inarguably the loudest voice in the Opposition, have their own spotty and utterly hypocritical record of listening to foreign entities, when being criticized.Unless the opposition ditches the Yellowtards and LP, they will perpetually be bogged down by the burden of hypocrisy that that group of self-proclaimed “decent people” brings. HRW, for its part, also voiced concerns that two years into former president Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino’s term, human rights abuses were hardly addressed.In September 2016, the New York Times also ran an article on the Philippines – then already under Duterte – that acknowledged the real root of extrajudicial violence as having started under the Aquino administration:It might seem that the Philippines’ trouble began when it elected Mr. Duterte, a brash provincial politician who has for decades embraced extrajudicial killings as a legitimate method of crime control. But the true roots of the problem can be traced to the administration of Mr. Duterte’s predecessor, Benigno Aquino III. That is because, experts say, the true cause of this kind of extrajudicial violence is the public’s loss of confidence in state institutions and its turning instead to more immediate forms of punishment and control. Mr. Aquino, elected in 2010 on promises to support the rule of law and human rights, failed to fix the Philippines’ corrupt and ineffective justice system. His administration also faced a series of security-related scandals, including a hostage crisis in Manila in 2010. And, perhaps most critical, Mr. Aquino was perceived as lazy and soft, unwilling to take the necessary steps to solve the country’s problems. Frustration with the government’s inability to provide basic security led to rising public demand for new leaders who would take more decisive action to provide security.It’s also worth mentioning, that when international human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin Clooney put attention on Gloria Arroyo’s detainment on plunder charges – charges which were eventually thrown out, by the way, due to lack of evidence – Leila De Lima, as Justice Secretary back then, effectively told Clooney, et al. to fuck off and “not interfere in local affairs”. One more small detail: part of Clooney’s plan was to elevate Arroyo’s case to the UNHRC.At this point, the most immediate question that comes to mind is, Ano na nga ba? What’s the plan, Philippines? How long do Filipinos plan on giving inordinate weight to what foreigners – especially the West – think of them, and to pander to them?How long does it plan to stay confused on the path it REALLY wants to take? It wants to be accepted by – more of play loyal terrier to – the West, and yet cannot completely deny or discard its Asian sensibilities and roots. Most of its Southeast Asian neighbors had an earlier start; they hardly gave a fuck about what the West though, did things their own way, adapted foreign practices that were beneficial, and eventually became prominent newly industrialized countries (NICs), or in the case of Singapore, one of the most prosperous nations in the world despite the odds against them.Only Filipinos can stop themselves from being fools that revere their chains. When they will finally get around to doing it is a question that will remain unresolved even past Duterte’s administration.[Photo courtesy: rt.com]",0
"“A nation cannot be governed by killing,” Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle said on Friday in a one-page letter that appealed anew for an end to the spate of killings attributed to the government’s war on drugs.Tagle also asked for a five-minute ringing of church bells at 8 p.m. starting Sept. 14, the Exaltation of the Cross, to “call on everyone to remember the dead and pray for them.”“The tolling of church bells in the evening to pray for the dead is an old Filipino custom that has almost disappeared. Now is the right time to revive it,” he said.Sought for comment, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said Cardinal Tagle’s “noteworthy concern for Filipino families” was a “sentiment shared’ by President Duterte, “as evidenced by his consistent pronouncements to protect the youth and future generations of this country.”Abella added: “Much attention was given the recent spate of deaths (but) the 1,308,078 drug personalities who voluntarily surrendered as of July 26, 2017, belie the claim that ‘we cannot allow the destruction of lives to become normal,’ and ‘we cannot govern the nation by killing.’ ”In Tagle’s letter issued on the feast day of the Virgin Mary, the prelate denounced as “inhuman and un-Christian” the act of inflicting harm or death on others.“With pain and horror, we continue to get daily news of killings around the country,” Tagle said. “We cannot allow the destruction of lives to become normal. We cannot govern the country by killing,” he added.“We call on those who harm or kill others to listen to their conscience, the voice of God that summons us to do good and avoid evil. Heartless violence can be conquered only by a change of heart and by discovering in the depths of our being the inclination to do good and to love our neighbor,” Tagle said.The country “cannot foster a humane and decent Filipino culture by killing,” he added.The letter was by far the archbishop’s strongest condemnation of the spate of killings that began last year when the Duterte administration launched its war against illegal drugs.The statement came amid public outrage over the recent killings of Kian Loyd delos Santos, 17; Carl Angelo Arnaiz, 19; and Reynaldo de Guzman, 14, under circumstances that implicated the police who had earlier described delos Santos and Arnaiz as drug runners gunned down for firing at them.Human rights groups, among them the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates, have cited at least 12,000 deaths connected to the drug war since July 2016, including those classified by police as “deaths under investigation.”Tagle also urged priests and lay leaders to find the time to attend the wakes of victims of extrajudicial killings (EJKs) in their communities “to bless the departed and to be one with the grieving families in sorrow and in hope.”The prelate had earlier issued a similar letter in August asking killers involved in EJK to “stop wasting human lives.”In Bacolod City, the Diocese of San Carlos in Negros Occidental was looking into the series of killings of leaders of farmers organizations that has created an atmosphere of fear in Guihulngan City, Negros Oriental.“Our diocese plans to hold an independent fact-finding mission to document the reported human rights violations regardless of whoever committed them,” said San Carlos Bishop Gerardo Alminaza in a pastoral letter issued on Thursday.Alminaza said there was a need to stop the “atmosphere of terror, fear and demoralization” among the people of Guihulngan, one of the priority areas in the country’s counterinsurgency program even during past administrations.So far, seven persons have become victims of EJKs in Guihulngan from July 23 to Aug. 30, Alminaza said.Tecson was vice chair of the Guihulngan chapter of Pamalakaya (Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas), a national federation of small fisherfolk organizations, while Asildo was an organizer of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan who worked as bookkeeper in the Department of Education office in Guihulngan.Alminaza said two others—Rolan Pacunla and Luardo Yac—were wounded in the series of attacks.Citing eyewitness accounts, the bishop said the method of killings was the same: the victims were shot by two men on board a motorcycle.Alminaza said leaders of other people’s organizations were also under threat. The bishop identified them as Marilou Alangilan, spokesperson of Kaugmaon Center for Children’s Concerns Foundation; Kaugmaon chair Cenona Estrada; Mountain Clinics health worker Josephine Saguran; Harry Cantilla and Florante Burdado of the drivers’ group, Piston; and Alberto Tecson’s wife, Lorna.",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday said he would not accept any position in a transition government if the administration campaign to revise the 1987 Constitution succeeded.The President also said he would step down by 2020 if a government system patterned after the French model—with a prime minister and a president sharing executive power—were in place by that time.“If we can have that in 2020, I will commit to you now [and] you do not have to remind me, if there can be a working federal setup by year 2020, I am going to step down,” he said in a speech in Malacañang.“I do not want any transition position. I do not have any plans of perpetuating myself in power. It ain’t in my system,” he added.Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III earlier said that Mr. Duterte’s term may be extended “if necessary” when the country transitioned to a federal form of government.“I’ve told the military time and again, as good as any other time, that if I overstay even for 24 hours here in Malacañang, you can arrest me and shoot me,” Mr. Duterte said on Tuesday.“I would rather abbreviate my term than extend it,” he added.The President also said the military had the duty to ensure that the country’s succession rules were followed if he were not able to finish his term.“It is your duty to see to it, if I go before this time, that the rules of succession in our Constitution will be followed,” he said.Mr. Duterte spoke after former Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr., former Commission on Elections Chair Christian Monsod, and other legal luminaries launched a coalition against Charter change on Tuesday.Monsod and Davide were members of the 1986 Constitutional Commission that drafted the Constitution.Davide warned that changing the country’s form of government would only entrench in power the country’s political dynasties.",1
"This is what will happen if all funds in pork barrel will be allocated in more important things like education.The free tuition fee was not included in the original budget for 2017, but the congress agreed to change it because of the disapproval of Lacson.“Inilipat sa DPWH pero yung implementation mananatili sa ARMM so isa lang ang conclusion and hindi pupwede because we will all be violating the [ARMM] Organic Act.. pumayag naman sila nung alam na talaga nila na titigasan ko yung sa P8.3-B” Lacson said during a press conference.The 8.3B budget of the DPWH for ARMM was opposed by Sen. Lacson and because of his tough stance against pork barrel, the congress decided to transfer billions of pesos to CHED.“Sila na yung nag suggest na ilagay nalang natin sa SUC para pakinabangan sa free tuition ng mga deserving college students saka mga scholars ng bayan” he addedSenator Panfilo Lacson was thanked by the College Students and Netizens because his hate on pork barrel became the reason of the free tuition fee in all State Universities and Colleges next year.Senator Bam Aquino even admitted that Senator Panfilo Lacson was the one who was responsible for the free tuition fee next year.In the video posted by the fanpage of Senator Ping Lacson, they clarified that the bill pushed in the Senate for free higher education like the one pushed by Sen. Bam Aquino has nothing to do with the P8.3B additional budget for CHED.Watch the video here:",0
"Erwin Valmoria Macua’s struggle to get a college degree could have been just another story about how hard work could make dreams come true.Except that Erwin worked his way to college while on duty as a security guard at St. Theresa’s College (STC) here where he finished a Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) degree with honors.For 17 years, Erwin, 38, worked as an STC security guard, a stint that would culminate in his graduation, cum laude, on Saturday.“I am still on cloud nine,” said Erwin, who was still on duty that day, hours before he took part in graduation rites at 3 p.m.Erwin couldn’t skip work although he should have spent the day preparing for his graduation. “It’s no work, no pay,” he said.The work arrangement, however, gave Erwin income that he said helped him finish college and finance his family’s needs.UnforgettableErwin’s march on the stage to get his diploma was unforgettable for him because of the jitters. He said he felt nervous knowing his wife and three children were watching as he got his diploma.Getting a college degree was a dream Erwin clung to even after being forced to drop out of Divine Word College of Tagbilaran (now Holy Name University) where he had enrolled in a civil engineering course.In 1999, Erwin had to drop out of the civil engineering course when his parents, who owned a small farm in their hometown in Trinidad, Bohol province, ran out of money to continue sending him to school.College dreamErwin would find himself in Cebu City looking for a job and finding one as security guard with the help of an uncle, who is also a security guard.He was assigned to STC. He had married but still dreamt of college.Erwin saw the chance to fulfill his dream when STC became a coed institution in 2013.He enrolled in BEED, a course which he said he could use to inspire the young to change their lives through education.Things started to fall into place for Erwin. Worrying about where to get the P20,000 to P36,000 in tuition needed per semester, Erwin was told he could avail himself of a 50-percent discount because he worked at the school.“Who could refuse such offer? This is a dream come true for me,” he said.Understanding familyThe next obstacle would come in the form of schedule. But Erwin leapt over that, too.While on duty from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. at STC, Erwin kept a full load in his course. Erwin attributed it to time management. It simply meant him doing school work after his duty, which left him only Sundays to spend with his family.But bonding time with family was often spent on school work that he brought home and on which his family helped. “I thank them for understanding,” Erwin said of his family’s support for his college stint.He did not let having much younger classmates bother him. He was consistently on the dean’s list.",1
"The Philippine government has “nothing to do” with a statement by Bangladesh’s central bank that it is open to an out-of-court settlement with Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC), Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said on Friday.Dominguez said that he told his Bangladesh counterpart, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, during their meeting on the sidelines of the 51st annual meeting of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank on Thursday that the planned settlement was “between [Bangladesh] and the private sector (RCBC).”“It has nothing to do with us. The Philippine government has taken action—we have penalized the banks that have not followed our procedures and we have filed legal cases,” Dominguez said.$81 million stolenHe said the Anti-Money Laundering Council had already filed cases in connection with the $81 million stolen from the Bangladesh central bank’s accounts in New York by hackers who wired the money to RCBC.“If they want to make a legal settlement, then we are not involved in that,” he added.In one of the world’s biggest cyberheists, the hackers stole the Bangladesh Bank money held at the New York federal bank in February 2016 using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system.From RCBC, some of the stolen money disappeared into casinos in Manila.“There is an option before us to settle the issue out of court,” a senior official of Bangladesh Bank told Reuters.Bangladesh had planned a suit to recover $66 million. Around $15 million had been recovered from a Manila junket operator.",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte will arrange the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to direct day by day checking of degenerate people both in government and the private division.Talking upon his landing in the Davao International Airport from a three-day state visit to Japan on Thursday night, the President said defilement keeps on pulling the nation down.He said he was alluding to government authorities as well as private people who degenerate government powers.Duterte said he will arrange the NBI to lead a test and way of life beware of government authorities and work force.Removing joining and debasement is a piece of the Duterte organization's plan to lift Filipinos out of destitution and enhance the economy.",0
"Every year, artists from every corner of the design world look to the Pantone Color Institute for guidance on what hue will reign for the next 365 days. Last year’s color, Radiant Orchid, a chirpy shade of lilac, was widely heralded as one that symbolized the economic recovery, optimism for humanity, and a sense of sophisticated purpose.This year’s color is … drum roll … ‘Tikka Masala.’ Yes, as in Chicken Tikka Masala!“This tasteful hue embodies the satisfying richness of a fulfilling meal, while its grounding red-brown roots emanate a sophisticated, natural earthiness,” Leatrice Eiseman, the executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said in the company press release. “This hearty, yet stylish tone is universally appealing and translates easily to fashion, beauty, industrial design, home furnishings and interiors.”There was mixed reaction among members of the design community. Michael Martin Navarrete Bello, a noted Filipino American interior designer based in San Francisco, said “The reddish-brown color reminds one of rust, the grimy, gag-inducing type that lines corners or frat boy dormitory-style bathrooms.”Social media has questioned what Pantone calls “a naturally robust and earthy wine red color” as “a color that makes you want to go to Olive Garden or order Tampax in bulk.”Others, including the American Hotel and Restaurant Association applauded the selection of Tikka Masala as the 2015 color. “It will be a boost to our members’ businesses as we expect our customers and diners to be looking out for Tikka Masala in our menus ” a spokesperson said.Update: The Adobo Chronicles would like to apologize for a major error in this story. One of our reporter interns apparently misinterpreted the color hue selected by the Pantone Institute. The corect name of the color is ‘Marsala,’ as in the wine Marsala from Sicily, Italy. We have fired the intern since the publication of this story.",0
"Unwilling to answer a clamor that she run for Vice President next year, Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo was a no-show at Wednesday’s launch of a movement to convince her to take the leap.“The best leaders are the reluctant leaders,” singer-composer Jim Paredes said, extolling the virtues of the congresswoman and widow of the late Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo, the multiawarded former mayor of Naga City.“I think Leni here is a blessing like Cory [Aquino] was,” Paredes said, adding that the nation needed leaders with conscience and humility.He said, “I feel safer with leaders like that, not like those who harbor certain presumptions—that ‘I have money, machinery, or [am] doing well in the surveys.’”The Leni Robredo for Vice President Movement was organized by the civil society group Kaya Natin Movement and supported by like-minded groups and individuals. The launch was held at Bantayog ng mga Bayani in Quezon City.Asked on Tuesday if she would appear at the event, Robredo exclaimed: “Oh no! I’m not part of it. In fact, I asked Harvey [Keh] early on to stop pushing for it, but he wasn’t listening.”Kids stressed“My kids are getting stressed because of it,” she said in a text message.Former Quezon Rep. Lorenzo Tañada III of the Liberal Party (LP) said Robredo was his choice should Sen. Grace Poe ultimately decline the offer to be the running mate of the party’s standard-bearer, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas.“Our point is we cannot wait forever” for Poe to make a decision, he said. “We have to organize.”He said Robredo herself had expressed a preference for Poe, the front-runner in the presidential preference surveys, to accept the LP’s offer to slide down as a vice presidential candidate.But if this would not materialize, Tañada said Robredo would fit the bill.If Poe does decide to be Roxas’ running mate, however, “this movement would transform into a Leni Robredo for Senator Movement,” Tañada said.A University of the Philippines economics graduate and a lawyer, the 54-year-old Robredo is planning either to seek reelection in her congressional district or to run for a Senate seat.Lack of political ambitionShe earlier said her awareness rating was too low, and that she had too little experience as a politician to run for Vice President.But Anak Mindanao Rep. Sitti Turabin-Hataman, one of her supporters, said Robredo’s lack of political ambition was precisely what convinced her of Robredo’s qualification.“We know she has not yet declared. She has a lot of apprehensions. These are the characteristics, the level of awareness and humility we want in a candidate. We know that if she is put in the position, she will double her efforts because she knows her limitations,” Hataman said.Former Pampanga Gov. Ed Panlilio described Robredo as “a true person, a good Filipino, who loves her country, shows deep sympathy for her countrymen, who lives simply, who loves her family and who puts God at the center of her heart.”LA Ruanto of Kaya Natin Youth recalled sharing a bus ride home with Robredo.“Every week she would go home, at least thrice a week, to go around each barangay (village) in her district. Where do you find a congresswoman who goes to the farthest reaches of her district?” he said.RELATED STORIESLeni Robredo absent during gathering urging her VP runLeni Robredo plans House or Senate run",1
"Change has indeed come to the Philippines under the administration of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte which marks exactly 100 days today.No drugs. No corruption. No tanim bala. No riding in tandem. No road rage. Above all, a more disciplined citizenry.During the previous Aquino administration, people in crowded malls were clogging up escalators talking or texting on their smart phonesNot anymore.Beginning immediately, mall security will strictly enforce a new escalator etiquette. Violators will be fined or asked to leave the building.It’s a simple rule when using mall escalators: stay on the right to stand, keep left to walk, and use the shiny railing to slide down.“Sa ika-uunlad ng bayan, disiplina ang kailangan.” (Discipline is key to nation-building)",0
"Vice President Jejomar Binay, a former human rights lawyer, on Friday downplayed the human rights violations committed during martial law, saying the country should “move on.”Binay spoke favorably about the son and namesake of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Sen.

"The speed in which reforms are taking place in the Philippines continues to amaze me. Truly, with political will and a strong leadership, nothing is impossible, even in this uber-conservative country.Just seven months ago, I wrote about the plans for a dissolution of marriage law (“Do what all the world does: Have a divorce law,” July 15, 2017) but noted that past efforts to do so have always failed because of the strong lobbying by the Catholic Church.But now comes the unanimous approval in the House Committee on Population and Family Relations of a bill on absolute divorce. The next step will be debates and a vote in the plenary, all scheduled before March, before the measure is sent to the Senate.The times have indeed changed, and politicians are well aware of this. Surveys have affirmed that a majority of Filipinos are in favor of a divorce law, especially Overseas Filipino Workers who have been pushing congressional members to pass this law.The country’s Catholic Church has to accept defeat on this one and resist the temptation to mess up the streets with another of their rallies using nuns, priests, and innocent school children.Local Church leaders should look to Pope Francis for guidance on compassion and benevolence. The Argentinian-born Pope has endorsed a more liberal approach to Catholics who have divorced, supporting moves to allow divorced members to reintegrate into the Church and receive communion.Pope Francis’ 250-page Amoris Laetitia (Joy of Love) is an exhortation to Church leaders to revamp their attitudes towards modern family life, urging more compassion and less rigidity. “Each country or region, moreover, can seek solutions better suited to its culture and sensitive to its traditions and local needs,” he said.I hope that the local Catholic Church can take Pope Francis’ words to heart. Our country needs to move forward and develop for the sake of the millions of poor Filipinos. But it will not do so if the Church keeps getting involved in politics, absurdly labeling every reform that runs counters to their interests as “Satanic” or any such nonsense.This thinking is so medieval, no wonder we are the last country in the world that still considers divorce illegal and a “sin.”Lucky for us, we now have a reform-minded administration and with the Catholic Church’s influence waning, we can count on the ever pragmatic politicians to look at voters’ sentiments instead of the Church’s fire-and-brimstone arguments.The still unnumbered congressional bill, “An Act Providing for Absolute Divorce and Dissolution of Marriage,” is actually a consolidated version of four others: House Bill 6027 of Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, HB 116 from Rep. Edcel Lagman, HB 1062 from Rep. Robert Ace Barbers, and HB 2380 from the women’s group Gabriela.When the House plenary debates on the bill, we can expect some changes although not on the overall thrust of the proposed law, which is to make it easier and less expensive for suffering couples to get out of marriages that are beyond repair.Our current laws on annulment and legal separation are complicated, expensive, and in desperate need of an overhaul.The grounds for annulment are grievous and one must prove mental or psychological incapacity or fraud, among others. The charges have to be investigated with testimony required of psychologists and psychiatrists. Imagine all the hurts and lies that have to be inflicted just so a couple can divorce and live their own lives.And then there’s the expense. Apart from the lawyers, the couples separating have to pay the medical experts, among other fees to the courts. One needs to have a minimum of P500,000, sometimes millions of pesos, just so you could have a court say your marriage never existed.Legal separation is not any easier, or any less expensive. One spouse still has to prove any of the following to be legally separated: Physical abuse, drug or alcohol addiction, homosexuality, infidelity, or abandonment.Under the proposed bill, the court will appoint counsel, social workers, and psychologists, for indigent litigants, said Rep. Lagman. The grounds for separation will be made much simpler, with a five-year separation being a valid reason for divorce, added Rep. Barbers.“Unlike the other grounds for annulment, the courts would not need to investigate or prove collusion between the parties because they would just have to show they had been separated for five years,” Barbers said.We need to give unhappy couples the chance to get out of bad marriages, especially those in abusive relationships. This is the kind and humane way that the Catholic Church would do well to support.",1
"Online gaming Pagcor’s call – DoJhome/News/Nation/Online gaming Pagcor’s call – DoJAny online gaming venture undertaken by a firm operating in Bataan should be subject to the regulatory authority of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor).This was according to the legal opinion of the Department of Justice (DoJ).This legal opinion, signed by DoJ Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre 2nd, was made in view of a letter to the Justice department sent by Emmanuel Pineda, chairman and administrator of the Authority of the Freeport of Bataan (AFAB).Pineda in his letter had requested legal opinion on online gaming at the Freeport of Bataan (FAB).A certain Grand Innovasia Concept Corporation (GICC) was licensed by AFAB to operate in the realm ofBusiness Process Outsourcing (BPO) support of offshore or online gaming.The GICC reportedly caters solely to international clients without access to the local market.But according to Pineda, the GICC has extended its BPO support for online gaming done abroad and that no actual gaming operations take place inside the FAB.In its reply, dated June 6, 2017 but released only recently, Aguirre opined that “unless there is a clear grant upon an ecozone such as AFAB to regulate games of chance, the Pagcor’s statutory regulatory function prevails.”“All told, and for the reasons already stated, we opine that any online gaming venture undertaken by the GICC, despite being limited only to foreign markets, should be subject to the regulatory authority of the Pagcor, not the AFAB,” the legal opinion said.",1
"The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said it is conducting an ongoing survey as part of its review of the minimum wage rate of household service workers (HSW) in Metro Manila.Based on the initial results of the survey, DOLE-National Capital Region (DOLE-NCR) Director Johnson Cañete disclosed many “kasambahay’ or HSWs in the Metro Manila get a pay bigger than the amount prescribed in Republic Act (RA) 10361 (The Kasambahay Law).“Many (employers in NCR) are paying their kasambahay with more than P3,000,” Cañete said in an interview.Cañete said they are targeting to complete the survey by next month, in preparation for the possible releasing of a new wage advisory for HSWs in Metro Manila on June.Depending on the result of the survey, the labor official said they may raise or retain the prevailing minimum wage rate for HSWs in the NCR.Previously, NCR has the highest minimum wage rate for HSWs at P2,500. Other regions paid their HSWs ranging from P1,500 to P2,000.",1
"There is no reason to expect that Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. would be a 'good' president. Like all of his contemporaries, he is the epitome of the traditional politician. Filipinos — especially northerners — point out that he has done much to improve their lives. That does not demonstrate principled leadership. It's an example of the same old partisan politics — reallocating and redistributing as much of the country's wealth that he will allow to his 'kababayans.' They overlook the fact that Marcos is NOT a representative of Ilocos; he is a SENATOR of the REPUBLIC. That is an office that serves the NATION; ALL Filipinos, NOT his local network of relatives, friends, cronies and hangers-on. His office represents ALL ethnic groups; it isn't limited to people born in the Ilocos region.

"A netizen posted her complaint on Facebook about the sale promo of a famous mall in the Philippines that not actually really sale according to her.Sheng Chi posted the photo on Facebook, shows the sale yellow tag price and the original price of the item that she bought from the famous mall.The yellow tag showed that the original price of the item that Sheng’s bought is 999.75 and discounted by almost 50%.But when Sheng removed the yellow tag, she discovered that the real original price of the item was only 399.75, cheaper than the price of the “sale”“Ngunit paano kung ang SALE ay isa lamang paraan para ang pinaghirapang pera ng ating kapwa ay kanilang makuha sa legal na paraan?” Sheng said on her Facebook post.She claimed that the photo is a clear evidence that the mall was cheating to it’s costumers.The photo has gone viral on social media and got different reactions from the Netizens, some of them believed that the photo was real and some of them were still not convinced if the case of Sheng was real.Update:On September 15, The mall released a statement about the incident:“We have investigated the price tag problem on item posted in picture by a customer .

"RuizFilipinos’ trust in the country’s long-time ally, the United States, has declined in the fourth quarter Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey results.The fourth quarter nationwide survey conducted last Dec. 3-6, 2016 among 1,500 respondents found 70 percent of Filipinos having “much trust” in the United States, 19 percent were undecided whether they have much trust or little trust, and 11 percent having “little trust” in the country.This translates to a net trust rating of “very good” +59, which is lower than the +66 (76 percent much trust, 11 percent little trust), registered during the third quarter SWS survey fielded in September, 2016.Net trust ratings of +70 and above is classified by SWS as “excellent;” +50 to +69, “very good;” +30 to +49, “good;” +10 to +29, “moderate;” +9 to -9, “neutral;” -10 to -29, “poor;” -30 to -49, “bad;” -50 to -69, “very bad;” and -70 and below, “execrable.”SWS noted that the net trust rating of the United States has been positive since it was first surveyed in December, 1994.The respondents were particularly asked, “For the following, please indicate if your trust/faith in (name of country) is “very much,” “somewhat much,” “undecided” if much or little, “somewhat little,” “very little,” or you have not heard or read anything about the (country) ever?”Meanwhile, China’s net trust rating significantly improved to +9 (39 percent much trust, 30 percent little trust), from -33 (22 percent much trust, 55 percent little trust) in the previous quarter.SWS noted that China’s net trust rating has been positive in only eight out of 40 surveys since public trust on selected countries was included in August 1994.",1
" Sentiments on the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which seeks to carve out a new autonomous region, appeared to have taken religious lines as many Christian residents of the city expressed opposition or wariness over BBL, according to a top city official.Mayor Al Qaid Akbar said Christian residents of the city were “very afraid” of the proposed BBL.The city has a population of 112,700 according to 2015 data from the Philippine Statistics Authority. At least 64 percent were Christians while 32 percent were Muslims. The rest had no defined religion.The exact number of Christians opposed to BBL was not clear but Akbar told the Inquirer he knew that the opposition was significant because the city was “dominated by Christians.”Mayor’s view“They are afraid of this new law and what may come out of this,” said the mayor during a consultation program here on the proposed BBL on Friday.“In my case, I am a Moro, I am happy to see this BBL passed,” Akbar said. “At the same time, I empathize with their stand,” said the mayor on Christian sentiments about BBL.He said results of previous plebiscites on autonomy showed Christians in the city did not want to be part of a territory that would be governed according to Muslim traditions and laws.Akbar did not elaborate when asked how he seemed to be sure about Christian sentiment in the city but said he was “aware of their apprehension.”“They have been very vocal even in the past and I respect that,” he said. Akbar said even to Muslims, like him, “this law is something new.”AdvantagesSen. Juan Miguel Zubiri, who was here for the consultation program, said the city, as part of Basilan, should consider joining the new autonomous territory being proposed by BBL, which has the full backing of Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).Ghadzali Jaafar, chair of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC), said he knew that “many residents” of the city would want to be part of the future Bangsamoro homeland. BTC had drafted the proposed BBL now pending in Congress.According to Jaafar, Isabela City was “in the middle of Basilan and if Basilan is benefiting from the BBL, we don’t want to see Isabela being left out.”Clear provisionsThe proposed BBL crafted by the BTC, led by MILF, seeks to impose a judicial system based on Sharia.But Section 1 of the proposed BBL’s Article No. 9 states that Sharia would apply only to Muslims.It said: “The justice system in the Bangsamoro shall consist of Sharia which shall have supremacy and application over Muslims only.”“Traditional or tribal justice system” would apply to indigenous peoples, the provision said.",1
" With all eyes on his first public meeting with Vice President Leni Robredo since her resignation as housing secretary in December last year, President Rodrigo Duterte apologized after failing to initially greet her in his speech at the Philippine Military Academy (PMA).Mr. Duterte acknowledged the presence of top officials at the PMA graduation at the start of his message, but he did not mention Robredo.He had already read several paragraphs of his speech when his aide went up to him to inform him of the oversight.“I apologize, Ma’am. It was not done intentionally. The one who wrote this did not include you. Let’s beat up [the writer],” Mr. Duterte said about a third into his 11-minute address.His remark drew laughter and applause from the audience.“I would like to apologize and acknowledge the presence of this beautiful lady, the Vice President of the Republic of the Philippines.

"Jose Gabriel La Viña also known as Pompee was one of the social media stars during the presidential campaign period. Eventually, he was given an opportunity to hold SSS as commissione who was not renewed by President Duterte.What happened? Here is an official statement from the Palace.From the Presidential Spokesperson –On the non-renewal of SSS Commissioner Jose Gabriel La ViñaThe President has mentioned time and again that he will not tolerate even a whiff of corruption.President Duterte decided not to renew the term of office of SSS Commissioner Jose Gabriel La Viña, who is serving in a holdover capacity, based on the following grounds:First, former Comissioner La Viña demanded a budget of P26M to fund his “social media” project with him as TV host. This was denied. He then requested for a budget of P1.6M per month for a media advertising program which was also denied.Second, Mr. La Viña requested for the accreditation of 7 brokers to handle SSS investments. The accreditation was denied because these brokers could not meet the requirements.Third, Mr. La Viña embarked on a vilification campaign against 4 SSS executives who crossed his path. Two of the 4 executives resigned and one is now a consultant of the Secretary of Finance.Fourth, despite an ongoing investigation, Mr. La Viña called a press conference and spoke against these 4 executives.Again, let this be a reminder to all public officials that the President is serious in curbing corruption and has strong resolve to promote good governance.What do you think on this?

"I could not help myself from ranting on my Facebook page yesterday about the many insensitive comments regarding the terrorist attack in my hometown, Davao City.It was evening in the Philippines and afternoon here in Spain. I was online and witnessed the breaking news and development of the terrible situation with many dead and wounded. Very soon, someone in my social circle posted criticism about the inefficiency of the new city administration and blamed them for the lack of security in a very disrespectful way.After a while, my news feeds were burning with news of mockery and blame games. At least, some of them apologized after being refuted, but most of them cavil and used the tragedy in a very immature way. Do they think they are cool, glamorous and smart? It was disheartening to read posts saying that victims at the night market were poor anyway; they were unlucky enough to be on the wrong spot and it was good that it happened in a market with poor people and not in a Mall. Can you imagine?A crisis situation takes out both the best and the worst in people. It’s sad to witness the mindless immaturity that often follows a tragedy. But also heart-warming to see how the majority help and comfort each other.Davao has been regarded as one of the safest cities in the world for many years. But due to the new President Duterte’s determination of making the Philippines into a more just society by fighting crime, corruption and terrorism, more threats can come. It’s ironic, but understandable as Duterte, who was the former Mayor of Davao also has mighty enemies. Since he is the one responsible for Davao’s success, it is almost expected that the terrorists will hit where it would hurt the most.The situation can easily escalate. Duterte has started a process that can be very painful and there will likely be more innocent victims. But like the 91% of the Filipino people, I feel that I can trust him. If nothing is done now, and carried out by the power of a man like President Duterte, my country will sink deeper into the swamp of drugs, crime and corruption. The terrorists will gain ground and a nation with great resources will become a banana republic.It’s sad that the Western media have not yet discovered the social and pragmatic profile of our president instead they are focusing on his rough statements and street smart ways of governing. But I know this will change when the result of fixing the nation speaks for itself. We should all support the bold attempt to bring peace and prosperity to our country and let the terrible terrorist attack unite us instead of mocking the Davaoeños and blaming the President on social media.----------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) on Friday said the Continuing Professional Development Act of 2016 or Republic Act (RA) 10912 will make “milking cows” of teachers and other professionals.Continuing development of professionals, according to the group, should come free as it is a right that is supported by the 1987 Philippine Constitution.Article XIV, Section 4, provides that teachers have the right to enhance their competencies as professionals and Section 5 of the same article provides that education must have the highest budgetary appropriation inclusive of trainings and seminars for teachers, Raymond Basilio, ACT secretary general, said.The ACT called for the CPD to be free as it is the government’s responsibility not just to elevate the competencies of the teachers but for the benefit of the students.The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 10912 “puts in place privatization schemes in the delivery of the program,” Basilio said.He called on commissioners of the Professional Regulatory Commission to immediately recall the IRR even as he said teachers and other professionals need continuing professional development programs.Under RA 10912, Basilio said, all professionals will be forced to attend seminars and trainings conducted by different private entities, which will charge P5,000 to P10,000 per seminar or training that will only be credited three units.With 45 units needed for renewal of license to practice the profession every three years, a teacher will have to spend P50,000 for seminars or trainings.“It is a fact that teachers are still underpaid and overworked already. Just and decent pay with enough benefits are the needs of the teachers, not additional burdens. We need benefits and services. We are not milking cows,” Basilio said.NEIL A. ALCOBER",1
"Supporters of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte may see House Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s decision to push for the withdrawal of the Philippines from the Inter Parliamentary Union as proof her strong alliance with the current administration, but I see it as the only correct stand against the meddling of this international lawmakers’ body with our country’s functioning judicial system.“You know the last time there was an IPU and then Senate President Koko Pimentel was head of delegation and he decried the interference of the IPU in our judicial processes. This time, over the objection of the Philippine delegation, again they did the same thing,” Arroyo said during a medical mission in Brgy. Escopa, Quezon City. “Since this is the second time they did it to my knowledge, I am recommending to the Senate which heads the delegation that we should withdraw our membership with the IPU,” she explained. Source: CNN PhilippinesPresidential Spokesman Sal Panelo outlined how the IPU trampled on the Philippine’s sovereignty.“The Office of the President considers the resolutions adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), as well as its subsequent decisions on the cases of Senator Leila de Lima and Senator Antonio Trillanes IV during its 139th Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, as an affront to the core of our State’s principles,” Panelo said in a statement on Monday. “We consider such actions as interventions of our domestic affairs for they do not only show the Philippines in a bad light in front of the global community but worse, such one-sided evaluations infringe on our sovereignty,” he added. Source: Inquirer.netThe IPU, together with the EU and the ICC, has consistently demonstrated bias for those opposed to Duterte’s administration on the basis of bare allegations of human rights abuse and extra judicial killings.As a former President with vast experience in international law and geopolitics, House Speaker Macapagal Arroyo’s push for the Philippine withdrawal from the IPU further validates the Duterte Administration’s stand against the international lawmakers’ body.With both houses of Congress supporting the president’s stand, the Philippine withdrawal from the IPU can hardly be called a capricious move or pique on the president’s part.Moreover, the IPU taking the cudgels for De Lima appears to be ignorant and arrogant.“The IPU’s resolution reiterating its concern to the continued trial and detention of Sen. De Lima exposes its ignorance on the workings of the justice system in the Philippines. IPU must educate itself before displaying its total lack of understanding of De Lima’s case,” he said in a statement. He noted that the senator was accorded due process, saying that a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction issued a warrant for De Lima’s arrest after a judicious determination of the existence of a probable cause for a drug related case filed against her. “No one is above the law. Her being a senator cannot shield her from the majesty of the law,” said Panelo. Source: GMA Network",0
"The Grains Retailers’ Confederation of the Philippines Inc. (Grecon) has expressed alarm over the wildfire-like spread of news and social media posts on fake rice in the country.“There’s no such thing as fake rice, only fake news,” Grecon president James Magbanua said in a news conference on Friday.Magbanua added that no fake rice had been discovered, saying the fake news on rice has been used to harass Grecon members.“We are offended by insinuations that members of Grecon deliberately put additives in or sell fake rice to the consuming public. It took us years to build our reputation and we will not allow this malicious fake news to taint and destroy our image,” he said.Magbanua added that they have received several reports that retailers were being harassed by consumers, who were asking for a cavan of rice in exchange for a kilo of alleged fake rice they had bought.The grains group condemned the irresponsible sharing of fake news on social media, especially those matters involving fake rice, saying lack of discernment helped create a new modus operandi, which specifically targets grains retailers.“There is a clear concerted effort to defraud and harass the members of Grecon,” Magbanua said.He added that they are ready to file appropriate criminal charges to hold accountable persons liable, be it from the consumers’ or the retailers’ side.“We would like to solicit the help and support from the NFA, DTI, DICT and other concerned law enforcement agencies to address the issue of fake rice, specially identifying and bringing to justice those who unscrupulously spread the fake rice issue, and those taking advantage of the situation by falsely claiming to have been victimized by the same,” Magbanua said.NFA is the National Food Authority; DTI, the Department of Trade and Industry; and the DICT, the Department of Information and Communications Technology.The group also questioned the timing of the circulation of the fake reports on rice.It was also around this time in 2015 when similar reports on fake rice became news, creating panic among consumers.Meanwhile, NFA Administrator Jason Aquino urged the public to be more vigilant and report to the agency any suspicious or unusual rice being sold in the market, so they can verify and take samples for laboratory analyses.Aquino also on Friday assured consumers that there is no “fake rice” being sold in the domestic market, citing laboratory tests conducted by the agency’s Food Development Center (FDC).The FDC conducted three laboratory analyses on six raw and two cooked rice samples submitted using microscopic analysis, starch analysis and sensory evaluation to test if these contain harmful chemicals.“A total of 6 rice samples were subjected to analysis… the result of all samples [showed real] rice, there is no fake rice,” Aquino said in a news conference in Quezon City.Allegations of fake rice being sold in the local market surfaced after a certain Rafael Furo posted a video on social media and claimed that the rice he purchased in Signal Market in Taguig City is actually plastic.Other incidents involving alleged fake rice were reported in Litex Market in Commonwealth, Quezon City; Davao; Borongan, Samar; Dumaguete City; and Cebu.Aquino said intentionally spreadingwrong information about plastic or fake rice is punishable by law.JAMES KONSTANTIN GALVEZ",1
"A bill that seeks to provide free education for children with “special educational needs” has been filed at the Senate.Senate Bill (SB) 1298 or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) aims to implement “zero-reject policy” in public schools as the bill mandates all public schools in the country to have their own SPED (Special Education) center and program.The bill filed by Sen. Joel Villanueva also seeks to provide these public schools additional resources for special education including the establishment of SPED centers, hiring of SPED teachers and other SPED services.Villanueva said all kinds of students, regardless of their status or disabilities, must be in school.To date, there are 34,000 public schools in the Philippines but only 600 of them have SPED centers and SPED programs.A study conducted by the World Health Organization says 15 percent of the population in a community have special needs but only 2 percent are being given government support.Under SB 1298, parental consent must first be given before the conduct of initial evaluation on a child with special educational needs and the use of an “Individual Education Program” or IEP, a unique curriculum designed for a specific disability.Autism, intellectual disability, developmental delay, orthopedic impairments, deafness and blindness are among the disabilities covered by the measure.The proposed bill aims to strengthen “mainstreaming” in schools that incorporate children with special needs in regular classrooms.This can be done through a skills upgrade of teachers, increase of SPED facilities and improvement of SPED programs, according to Villaneuva.He, however, clarified that it would still be the parents’ call to subject their children to the program.NEIL A.

"In July 2013, the Inquirer broke the story on the scam to funnel P10 billion in Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) allocations of lawmakers to ghost projects in exchange for kickbacks in a scheme allegedly masterminded by businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles.Former Senators Jinggoy Estrada, Juan Ponce Enrile, Ramon Revilla Jr. and other government officials were implicated in the pork barrel scam.Estrada was accused of plunder and 11 counts of graft for allegedly pocketing P183 million from his PDAF allocation from 2004 to 2010.The Ombudsman indicted Estrada, Enrile and Revilla in the Sandiganbayan for plunder and graft in June 2014 in connection with the pork barrel scam. Napoles was their coaccused.Estrada surrendered to the Philippine National Police on June 23, 2014. The three senators were detained at the PNP Custodial Center in Camp Crame.On Jan. 7, 2016, the Sandiganbayan threw out the petition for bail of Estrada in his plunder case.In its resolution, the Sandiganbayan’s Fifth Division gave credence to the testimonies of principal whistleblower Benhur Luy, socialite Ruby Tuason and other state witnesses who admitted to participating in the scam.The division said the Office of the Ombudsman was able to provide “strong evidence of guilt” against Estrada in support of its claim that he should be held liable for graft and plunder for receiving P183 million in kickbacks from Napoles.On Sept. 12, 2016, Estrada filed an “omnibus motion” for bail invoking the so-called Arroyo ruling.The Ombudsman objected to the motion as irregular, saying it was an attempt to skirt the prohibition on a second motion for reconsideration.The Supreme Court acquitted former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of plunder in July 2016 in the P366-million Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office intelligence fund case over the failure of the prosecution to identify the “main plunderer.”Estrada was allowed to post bail on Sept. 16, 2016.The Fifth Division, in a 3-2 decision, granted Estrada’s second pleading, an omnibus motion to post bail on insufficiency of evidence and humanitarian grounds. But it denied Estrada’s motion to dismiss the case.SOURCE: INQUIRER ARCHIVES",1
"The Duterte administration does not employ trolls or people who spew hate speech or insults online or use Facebook for partisan purposes, a Palace official said on Wednesday.Malacañang spokesman Harry Roque made the statement in connection with the US network’s MSNBC report taking Facebook to task for training campaign teams around the world, including that of President Rodrigo Duterte, on how to maximize the use of Facebook in political campaigns.The raining resulted in Facebook publishing lies peddled by the camps and supporters of the candidates themselves, as well as the presence of plenty of pro-administration Facebook pages and Facebook accounts.“We have today an Assistant Secretary for Social Media who as you know is Assistant Secretary [Margaret] Mocha Uson. We continue to utilize social media in promoting the accomplishments and the messages of the administration. Obviously, we don’t use it for partisan or political purposes because there’re no elections until 2022,” Roque said.“If trolls are paid by the government, they wouldn’t have attacked me in the first place,” he added.Roque was referring to tirades made by blogger Rey Joseph Nieto, who called for his resignation over his remark that the supporters of the President–including Nieto–should throw hollow blocks at critics of the government.Nieto is under contract as head of strategic communications for the Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs under the Department of Foreign Affairs.Prior to Nieto’s call, Roque had said in an interview with Uson that as Palace spokesman, he will throw hollow blocks at those who will besmirch the name of President Rodrigo Duterte.This comment by Roque is what prompted Nieto to say that hollow blocks should instead be thrown at journalists.Uson and Nieto have also been very open in expressing their sentiments that former Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is the legitimate Vice President in their Facebook accounts and blogs even if Marcos lost to now-Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo by 263,473 votes.Uson and Nieto are also among the President’s supporters who call Robredo as a fake Vice President.Still, Roque maintained there are no trolls in the government ranks.“I can assure you that there is no budgetary line item for payment of trolls in the social media as far as this administration is concerned. [And] we find trolls of this nature also on the other side of the political fence defending the prior administration, attacking this administration,” he said.“And again, I can only point to myself as living proof that there cannot be any official funding or even sanction on the activities of pro-Duterte trolls because had this been the case, then we would have prevented the vicious attacks against me,” Roque added.Under Section 4, Article 3 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, “No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press, or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.”",1
"An ally of President Duterte said the declaration of martial law in Mindanao should help authorities solve “other problems like criminality” in the region, though the threat of the Maute group was confined to only a small part of the island.Surigao del Sur Rep. Johnny T. Pimentel said he believed the Maute group, whose members are reportedly behind the attack on Marawi City, was limited to Lanao del Sur province.“As far as the provinces in Caraga region, Region 13, we have not sensed any presence of the Maute group,” Pimentel told reporters.But he said he believed Mr. Duterte was right to declare martial law in all of Mindanao because of other peace and security problems facing other parts of the region.“This is just one decision to solve the other problems in other provinces,” he said.Pimentel said martial law was not an overreaction to the Marawi crisis.“No, I don’t think so. The proclamation of martial law is timely so we can solve other problems like criminality,” he said.WorrisomeBut Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano, a staunch critic of Mr. Duterte, said placing all of Mindanao under martial law was worrisome because Maute attacks were confined to Lanao del Sur.“Citing security problems, aside from Maute, in Western and Central Mindanao as the reasons why the declaration covers the entire Mindanao is something that we should consider deeply because those security issues have been there for the longest time,” he said.“This may mean that martial law could extend much longer than intended,” Alejano said.Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, leader of an opposition bloc in the House, said Congress should study carefully “whether there is a constitutional basis for an expanded coverage like the entire Mindanao area.”He reminded the government that under the 1987 Constitution, a “state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ.”RELATED VIDEO",1

"Dr. Stefanus Taofik died in the line of duty after working a 4 day straight shift during the Hari Raya holidays in Jakarta Indonesia leaving behind his wife and 1-year-old son. According to reports, the dedicated doctor did not take breaks during the 4-day shift which led to a sudden heart failure when he finally decided to take a rest.He was found by his colleagues collapsed and unresponsive inside a hospital ward prompting them to immediately try to revive him but it was already too late. In June 26 the good doctor passed away at the age of 35 dedicating his life to his duty.Authorities has ruled out foul play in their initial investigation and said in an official statement that the doctor's cause of death is heart failure due to insufficient rest.It is not uncommon for workers in the medical field to work long shifts that is why it is one of toughest and most crucial jobs in the world. Many doctors often take multiple shifts in different hospitals giving them little to no time at all to take a break or rest. Such is the case for Dr. Taofik who worked as anesthesiologist in two other hospitals besides the one where he perished.Many netizens from all over the world who read about the tragic story of Dr. Stefanus praised him for being a responsible and dedicated doctor. We must remember though, that while being dedicated to your career is good, it can also be dangerous if you neglect rest as the human body has its limits.RIP, Dr. Stefanus. The world has lost one of the best and hardworking men of medicine. Our condolences goes to his family.",0
"The 2016 Miss Universe Pageant will be telecast only in the Spanish language, according to a joint announcement today by Univision Communications Inc., Donald Trump and Miss Universe Organization President Paula Shugart.Back in January, the Miss Universe Organization announced a long-term partnership that will bring the Spanish-language television and digital rights for the MISS UNIVERSE® and MISS USA® pageants to Univision Communications Inc.

"True to form in the way Filipinos imagine themselves to be the inventors of “peaceful change in leadership”, we see the Inquirer editor, in that familiar tradition of Filipino self-aggrandisement, insert the “Filipino experience” into Malaysian current events. Today’s Inquirer Op-Ed peace is given the title “The Marcoses of Malaysia”. Not surprisingly, practically the entire article is backward-engineered from the premise that the rout of the once-ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party of now-former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in the recent parliamentary elections there draws historical parallels from the fall of the Marcoses in that 1986 Philippine “revolution”.Viewed through a neutral lens of a mind not indoctrinated in Yellowtard mindsets, what happened in Malaysia is remarkable by and of itself. It is a peaceful transition of power within the framework of Malaysian law via a legitimate election and the subsequent transfer of power promptly following due process. The investigation of the alleged abuses perpetrated by Najib was swift and orderly and yielded results quickly. This again was expected because the transfer of power did not upend nor the least bit disrupt the day-to-day operations of state agencies.The Inquirer editor would, of course, gloss over all that, shunting her readers’ thought streams into what the piece is really all about…Much of the Malaysian electorate’s fury was directed at Najib’s high-living wife, Rosmah Mansor, whose penchant for extravagant jewelry, handbags and shopping sprees inevitably led to comparisons with another legendary profligate, former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos. Decades before Mansor, Imelda Marcos had set the template for dictators’ wives becoming among the wealthiest, most powerful women in the world by helping themselves to the public trough.It is easy to see the textbook-case confirmation bias at work. When one wants to see the face of Jesus Christ in the sky, any cloud formation will do. The trouble with the Inquirer editor is that she is seemingly under pressure to find the face of her Jesus Christ in Malaysian politics.Najib’s removal from power was not an “ouster”. It was a democratic business-as-usual change in leadership. The Inquirer editor took a pained convoluted path towards her You Don’t Say Moment — that all this happend “without a single shot fired”. But of course no shots were fired — because this was in no way like the bald coup d’état engineered by the Yellowtards back in 1986 following a defeat in a legitimate election. Perhaps, as the Inquirer Editor quipped, the Malaysian exercise was “something of a revolution”. Of course it was, but not the sloppy character-destroying type the Yellowtards subjected Filipinos to in 1986.The Malaysian experience cannot be more different to the Philippine experience. Malaysia prospered as a society under the so-called “dictatorship” of the UMNO party. The change in leadership was effected by a relatively more informed electorate than the street mob that shouted down the late former President Ferdinand Marcos with shrill gusto back in 1986. And because the Malaysian change-in-leadership was effected by a proper election, it is far clearer that the new leadership of the Pakatan Harapan coalition headed by former-now-current Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad enjoys a national mandate. Compare this to the dubious self-appointed “mandate” of the 1986 “revolutionary government” of the late former President Cory Aquino. It remains debatable whether the Manila street mob that catapulted her to power back then actually represented the collective wishes of Filipinos across the entire archipelago.Indeed, much of the prosperity Malaysia achieved over the last several decades, which all but left the Philippines in the dust, was achieved under Mahathir who himself ruled Malaysia with an iron fist during his time. Whatever is said about Najib’s recent rule could also be said of Mahathir. It is interesting that the Inquirer editor left that little detail out in today’s piece — perhaps, again, because she could be motivated to write what she writes by parties with specific agendas in mind.Yet again it becomes clear what a slanted view of the world Filipinos get as a result of the collective mindset perverted to the ends of the Yellowtards. It is high time Filipinos purge their brains of this intellectual disease and start applying more modern thinking to their political discourse. Articles like these published the nation’s biggest print media corporation should be regarded with more critical minds free from the baggage of voodoo politics of yore.",0
"BRIEF: A cacique democracy (Casiquismo) is a political system determined by the power of local bosses (caciques), who successfully influence the electoral process in their favor. It has been used most notably to refer to late 19th century Spain and early 20th century and twentieth century Mexico [Varela Ortega 2001].What is Democracy?A political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair elections.The active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life.Protection of the human rights of all citizens.A rule of law, in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.1st Element: Free and Fair ElectionsThe lack of economic freedom, as shown by the failure of trickle-down economics, the failure of land reform, and the failure of the government to provide basic infrastructure, all of which Heydarian clearly admit, and The lack of intellectual freedom, as shown by an outdated and underfunded education system [DEPED 2015], exacerbated by chronic lack of legislative and executive support for the freedom of information law [Abueva 2015].2nd and 3rd Elements: Participatory Governance and Protection of Human RightsSIDEBAR: The Liberal Party’s Bottom-up Budgeting (BuB) Program, an effort to spread this laudable cause [Dalangin-Fernandez 2016], is oblivious to this reality. Instead of a thrust towards more inclusive governance, the fact of the matter is that BuB will serve as a legitimized de facto pork barrel fund for local caciques.4th Element: Equal ProtectionDemocracy Fatigue and Strongman SyndromeDo Filipinos experience fair elections? No.Do Filipinos engage in participatory governance? No.Do Filipinos benefit from the protection of Human Rights? No.Do Filipinos enjoy Equal protection under the law? No.Democracy is like herpes: you either have it or you don’t.Benigno Cojuangco Aquino III backs Manuel Roxas [Bacani 2015]Peping Cojuangco backs Jejomar Binay [Hegina 2015]Danding Cojuangco backs Grace Poe-Llamanzares [TP:Grace Poe Connections], who may also be backed by Benigno as his “Plan B” [del Rosario 2016]A well-known political analyst calls for the preservation of democracy as Filipinos face the prospect of an autocratic post-Aquino government. But what, exactly, is the status quo? Because a democracy that’s just on paper is no better than a diploma from Recto U.In “The End of Philippine Democracy?”, De La Salle university professor and foreign policy analyst Richard Heydarian called for “a gradual, systematic reform towards substantive democracy” as the Philippines suffers from the “Strongman Syndrome” characterized by Duterte and Marcos Jr.’s meteoric rise in popularity [ Heydarian 2016 ].Heydarian made several assumptions that led him to that conclusion, with the most poignant being the claim that the Philippine Cacique Democracy [ Anderson 1988 ] is still a democracy.Gradual, systematic reform toward a substantive democracy rests on the assumptions that the current version of Philippine democracy is sufficiently democratic. That is, before Heydarian jumped into conclusions, he should have first shown that a cacique democracy is a democracy to begin with.And that's what we're going to talk about.Let’s first have a working definition of what constitutes a democratic government.A democracy consists of four basic elements [ Diamond 2004 ]:All these four elements should be present in a substantive democracy. Meanwhile, the presence of some and the absence of the others imply a partial democracy. Needless to say, the absence of any implies that there is no democracy at all.Now, it’s time to ask the question:The Philippines being a cacique democracy is a universal consensus – even Heydarian agrees to that. However, the terms “casique” and “Casiquismo” are hardly sufficient to describe the Philippine situation.The term “oligarchic democracy” or simply, “Oligarchy”, best describes Philippines politics, as “competition for political office has revolved around contestation for the spoils of state power between rival families and factions within this ruling class” and that “the majority of Filipinos (are) susceptible to clientelist, coercive, and monetary inducements and pressures during elections [ Hedman 2010 ]”.While some scholars argue that the two can co-exist [ Winters 2011 ], their definitions of democracies are inconsistent with the four elements mentioned above. Now, it's time to examine the Philippines and see if it possesess the four elements that constitute democracy.As a side note, it’s also interesting to note that Heydarian even cited Aristotle to emphasize one of his points, when it’s Aristotle himself who said that democracy and oligarchy cannot co-exist [ Aristotle 350 BCE ].Filipinos have never experienced a truly free and fair elections because of at least two things:Even this 2016 Elections is mired in controversy, as people question its integrity after the COMELEC decided to disable security functions of vote-counting machines. Even a recent Supreme Court directive to re-institute one of these security features only managed to elicit desultory compliance.And this:And let's not even discuss the fact that one of the candidates are closely related to the survey firms [ TP: Businessworld Survey ].I can go on and on but let's just be honest here: the only chance for a non-establishment candidate to win an election is by overwhelming majority, as the entire electoral process is rigged to favor the oligarchy or the candidates that it supports.Participatory governance, as exemplified by the Robredos of Naga City [ Angeles 2007 ], is an extreme rarity in Philippine Politics.The dominance of political dynasties, their propensity to make government decisions with vested interests in mind, and their ability to manipulate the electoral process, make participatory governance tremendously difficult, if not virtually impossible.The recent Kidapawan massacre is a testament to this fact. In late March 2016, thousands of starving farmers protested against the government, an attempt at participating in decision-making over the use of the provincial calamity fund. In response, the government, in response, sent dispersal units and fired live ammunition on these hapless peasants, killing several and injuring dozens in the process [ TP: Mar Roxas Speechwriter ]. The aftermath includes the arbitrary detention of pregnant women and the elderly [ de Santos 2016 ].Exacerbating matters is an entire week’s worth of deafening Presidential Silence, a tacit consent for the red-baiting government’s brutality [ TP: NPA ]. The Kidapawan massacre is not just an affront to participatory governance: it’s a blatant attack on fundamental right to life, liberty, and security.This is not an isolated case. the 1987 Mendiola Massacre [ Dychiu 2010 ], the Lianga Massacre [ Karapatan 2015 ], the Pangantucan massacre [ Corrales 2015 ] and the Hacienda Luisita Massacre [ Tupaz 2015 ], are just a few of the many ghastly instances of the government’s wanton disregard for human rights and resistance to participatory governance.Ironically, three of these massacres were committed under Cojuangco-Aquino administrations (Corazon and Benigno III), while last one – Hacienda Luisita – was commited right on Cojuangco land.That is, Filipino Politics lacks the second element and third elements of a democracy. Participatory governance and protection of human rights are but a myth for a disconcertingly vast majority of Filipinos.We can stipulate that equal protection never existed during the colonial times. The Philippines had its first shot at equal protection after the 1946 liberation. However, President Manuel Roxas’ Bell Trade Act of 1946 [ Shalom 1980 ]. Roxas died barely two years into office and successor Quirino continued his policies.Magsaysay attempted a more pro-Filipino stance through aggressive agrarian reform policies [Antonio 1961], but he was killed in a plane crash midway through his term. Garcia, followed a similar stance through the “Filipino First” policy, but his gains were reversed after his election loss to USA-backed Quirino.Then it culminated in the bloody and corrupt dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos.The 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution was an effort to topple a dictatorship that favored a few select presidential cronies such as Danding Cojuangco. EDSA, for the common man, is an attempt put the blindfold back over Lady Justice’s eyes. The common man hoped that after the EDSA revolution, justice will be meted out objectively, without fear or favor, regardless of money, wealth, fame, power, or identity.But we were wrong.While a petty thief will go straight to a dank, acrid, foul-smelling jail cell, members of the oligarchy get away with far more heinous crimes.Through Mar Roxas’ recommendations, plunderer Joseph Estrada was pardoned and is now openly supporting Grace Poe. Marcos henchman Juan Ponce Enrile has never been out of “public service”. Bongbong Marcos, the president’s son, is even the frontrunner in the VP race. Danding Cojuangco continuously manipulates the Supreme Court and has been actively shaping the national political landscape since forever. There is no end in sight, and I even felt no need to cite sources for this paragraph because all of these are common knowledge.And just this week, accused plunderer Janet Lim-Napoles was even granted bail [ Cayabyab 2016 ].Equal protection is just a delusion that helps academics sleep at night.Let us recap the four elements of the democracy and whether they exist in the current setting.So what, exactly, was the democracy Heydarian was referring to?Mr. Heydarian, “a gradual, systematic reform towards substantive democracy” happens only when we have a democracy to work on, but reality dictates that we don’t even have a single one of its pillars.Suggesting that Filipinos are experiencing democracy fatigue is just like saying they’re tired of intergalactic travel.Why? Because we have yet to experience either. Because there has never been a democracy that the common Filipino could be weary of.Repurposing the words of the late comedic genius Joan Rivers [ Rivers 2014 ]:For many common Filipinos – and that includes your truly – the vote for Duterte is not due to some newfangled motive.As you may well know, three of the four presidential bets enjoy Cojuangco support:Sans Rodrigo “Rody” Duterte, what is the 2016 elections but another oligarchic family affair?Mister Heydarian, never use a cannon to kill a fly.Filipinos are not tired of democracy. Instead, we are tired of the oligarchy: the exact thing we have, the exact thing we are fighting against._____Did you like this post? Help ThinkingPinoy.com stay up!

"Manny Pacquiao won a 12-round unanimous decision over Timothy Bradley on Saturday to avenge his controversial 2012 loss to the previously unbeaten American. But that was not the big news.Moments after losing the WBO welterweight crown to the Filipino boxer and congressman, Bradley accused Pacquiao’s mom Dionisia, popularly known as Mommy D, of voodooism. Bradley claims that Mommy D cast some witchcraft on him, causing him to be disoriented in the last few rounds of the title fight at the MGM arena in Las Vegas.Mommy D was caught on camera, clutching a rosary and a tiny missalette, uttering unintelligible words while pointing at the American boxer.It is believed that witchcraft is still practiced in parts of the Philippines and there still exist some occasional witches, locally known as mangkukulam.The Pacquiao camp, however, simply dismissed Bradley’s accusation as “sour grapes.”",0
"Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas on Friday said the Catholic Church will remain faithful to the Lord’s teachings on the sanctity of marriage, even as he denounced same-sex relationships as “a tragic error of humanity.”“It is in God’s plan that a man and a woman enter into that sacrament of matrimony, which Jesus himself instituted,” Villegas said in a speech before lay Catholic leaders at a national conference in Cebu City on Friday. “The Church must be firm in proclaiming the truth,” he added.“In the beginning, God created them male and female, and He created them, and God said, ‘It was very good,’” Villegas said, quoting Scripture on the subject of creation from the book of Genesis.Villegas was among the speakers at the three-day National Convention on Family and Life held at Summit Circle Hotel in Cebu City from July 16 to July 18.Speaking to about 400 people, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) president said it had always been a part of the Church and its mission to draw humanity to the Lord.“That first thing we should call to mind is Jesus died for all. At the cross, there were only seven words attributed to Jesus, and at the cross, He did not ask: ‘Are you a homosexual? If you are, I’m not dying for you.’ No. There was no such thing,” he said.While the Catholic Church denounces same-sex union, Villegas said being a homosexual was not a sin in itself.“We do not judge. We constantly bring to them God’s invitation: ‘Come follow me. Come and be holy. Come and be a saint.’ That is a call given to all of us,” he said.The prelate said the CBCP will issue by the end of August a pastoral letter on the care of homosexual persons, as well as the Church’s doctrine and position with regard to same-sex unions.Villegas admonished people to be careful in using the term “marriage,” and never to apply it to persons who agree to a relationship with the same sex.“Number one, it (same-sex union) is not a marriage. It is an agreement, a union, or call it whatever it is, but it is certainly not marriage,” he said.RELATED STORIESDenial of same-sex unions violates right to equal protection of law—ex-UP law deanSame-sex civil unions: unconstitutionalTime for Church and State to recognize same-sex union",1
"The chief of police of Cabadbaran City and 42 of his men were ordered relieved by Agusan del Norte Police Provincial Office (PPO) Director Sr. Supt.

"The United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) has urged authorities to resolve a bombing outside a mosque in Talayan, Maguindanao that injured eight persons, including the incumbent mayor and his father.Former Vice President Jejomar Binay, UNA chairman, said the bombing was a deplorable act.“The concerned law enforcement agencies should act with dispatch to identify and arrest the perpetrators. The tense situation in Talayan should not be allowed to spiral out of control,” he noted.“Failure to decisively act on the incident could only reinforce the growing perception that the peace and order situation, particularly in Mindanao, has worsened,” Binay said.According to media reports, authorities still have no leads on identities of the suspects who hurled two grenades outside the Grand Mosque in Talayan town last Friday.Reported wounded in the explosion were Kagui Ali Midtimbang, 62; his son and mayor Nathaniel Midtimbang 33; and six security escorts.The Midtimbangs ran under UNA in the 2016 local elections.The victims had come from afternoon prayers at the mosque.",1

"THE Senate committee on economic affairs wants the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to have more power to carry out its mandate to go after erring telecommunication companies.Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, chairman of the committee, said the NTC, the agency in charge of regulating and supervising public telecommunications services, needs more power to impose penalties against telecommunication companies that fail to deliver satisfactory services to consumers.The grant of additional power will be included in the committee report to be submitted by Gatchalian following the investigation held by the panel on the operation and regulation of the telecommunications industry.The Senate hearing was called to determine if the government has ample regulatory mechanisms to make the playing field even.“Telecommunications is a public utility, and just like other public utilities, it has to be regulated to make sure that the playing field is even, to make sure that customers are getting the value that they are paying for,” Gatchalian said.The committee learned during the hearing that the NTC has had difficulties in imposing drastic penalties against Globe Telecoms and Smart Communications Inc. for their failure to provide satisfactory service to subscribers.NTC Deputy Commissioner Edgardo Cabarios told senators that they have failed to compel Globe and Smart to deliver the minimum speed of 12 megabytes per second (mbps) in Internet connectivity.The two companies have claimed in their advertisements that they can provide that kind of Internet speed.Gatchalian noted that because of limitations in the law, the NTC cannot do anything to force Globe and Smart to deliver what they promised to their subscribers.He added that for such transgressions, the two companies are only required to pay a penalty of P200 per day.“The NTC needs more teeth to better regulate the telecoms industry. I will make sure that it gets the same powers like the ERC (Energy Regulatory Commission),” Gatchalian said.The ERC regulates the energy sector. It has extensive powers, including quasi-judicial powers, to control and penalize erring power companies.",1
"A dragon tattoo. Pictures with someone who facilitated a huge drug shipment from China. Bank accounts.Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV cited these at the seventh Senate hearing on the P6.4-billion “shabu” (crystal meth) shipment from China to drive home the point that Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte was engaged in smuggling.The vice mayor, a son of President Duterte, denied the allegations.The lawyer of the vice mayor, Rainier Madrid, told reporters after the hearing that Trillanes was a “military propagandist” whose real target was none other than the President.Trillanes accused the younger Duterte of being a member of the Chinese drug triad, citing a supposed dragon tattoo on his back as proof.The vice mayor admitted that he had a tattoo on his back. But he refused to show it as requested by Trillanes, invoking his right to privacy.“No way!” the younger Duterte replied when Trillanes asked him if he was willing to have a picture of his tattoo taken in the presence of the Senate sergeant at arms so it could be submitted to the US Drug Enforcement Agency for decoding.Physical evidence“The tattoo is physical evidence of his membership in the triad,” the senator said.Trillanes said the triad he was talking about was based in China, Macau and Hong Kong, and was engaged in criminal activities, including importing illegal drugs.He later told reporters that the information he got from a foreign country showed that the younger Duterte and a certain Charlie Tan, whom the vice mayor acknowledged as a friend and a drinking buddy, were triad members.Asked why a foreign government had such information, Trillanes said the vice mayor was on the radar of foreign authorities.He said the membership of the President’s son in the triad was the reason the illegal drug shipment entered the country through the Bureau of Customs (BOC).The vice mayor and his brother-in-law, Manases “Mans” Carpio, appeared at the Senate blue ribbon committee hearing after Trillanes sought their attendance because customs fixer Mark Ruben Taguba II had mentioned at previous hearings that his contacts at the BOC were claiming they were part of the Davao Group, which is allegedly involved in smuggling.PhotosBefore Trillanes posed questions to the brothers-in-law, he presented pictures of the vice mayor with Kenneth Dong, who facilitated what turned out to be the shabu shipment from China; of the younger Duterte with Charlie Tan; and of the younger Duterte with Carpio, Tan and Davao City Councilor Small Abellera.Trillanes told reporters he presented the photos to show that the vice mayor was close to Dong, Abellera and Tan,and that the President son’s “fingerprints are all over the shabu shipment and smuggling” at the BOC.Before they fielded questions from Trillanes, the vice mayor and Carpio read statements denying their alleged involvement in the shabu shipment.“[A] senator once said that we are a family of murderers and that I’m untouchable. Allow me to quote a message from a colleague of mine in the Davao City council: ‘Every [dog] has its day. The law of karma will operate especially to those with evil intent,’” the younger Duterte said.‘Publicly crucified’Reading his statement, Carpio said he and his brother-in-law had been “publicly crucified based on rumors and gossip.”Carpio said he did not know and had never met Taguba.He also explained his visits to the BOC as part of representing his clients. “I have no knowledge of or involvement in the illegal shabu shipment,” he said.The President’s son-in-law is the lawyer of Rodolfo Reta, owner of Aquarius Container Yard, designated examination area (DEA) of the BOC in Davao City.In 2010, the BOC rescinded the 25-year contract with Reta to operate the DEA after the businessman reported the alleged misdeclaration of goods in some of the containers passing through an X-ray machine.The incident led to Davao Port District Collector Anju Nereo Castigador’s dismissal from service as ordered by the Ombudsman in 2012.The DEA, however, remains closed.At the hearing, Carpio said he knew Charlie Tan, a businessman who owned a bar and was in the seafood business.Bank accountsTrillanes also asked the vice mayor if he had an account in the Philippine National Bank (PNB) in Sta. Ana, Davao City, and the latter said he had one there.He mentioned a specific bank account number and asked whether this was the vice mayor’s account in PNB. The younger Duterte asked the chair whether he should answer “irrelevant questions.”Sen. Richard Gordon, chair of the blue ribbon committee, told the younger Duterte it was up to him if he wanted to answer. The vice mayor said he did not want to answer Trillanes’ questions anymore.Bank secrecy lawThe younger Duterte also refused to say whether he had bank accounts in Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. and Bank of the Philippine Islands.“There is a law on bank secrecy and I have the right to privacy,” he said.“So which part of the question will incriminate you?” Trillanes asked the younger Duterte, noting that the vice mayor had P104 million in his bank accounts as of November 2015.The younger Duterte refused to answer.As for Carpio, Trillanes asked him if he had a bank account in Metrobank. Carpio denied having one. But he said he had a BDO account.Trillanes also asked Carpio if as of late 2015 he had P121 million in deposits. The President’s son-in-law invoked the bank secrecy law. He disputed the senator’s allegation, saying “I don’t have that much money.”Asked by the senator whether they were willing to sign a pro forma bank waiver, the brothers-in-law refused.Gordon said he would hold the next hearing on Monday but would no longer call the two men.",1
"For violating President Rodrigo Duterte’s order against talking with his relatives on state contracts or appointments, the career of Assistant Transportation Secretary Mark Tolentino in government has been derailed.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque announced on Monday that the President had “terminated the services” of Tolentino, who accused officials of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) last week of delaying the Mindanao Railway Project.Tolentino was the President’s schoolmate and is a Lex Talionis fraternity brother.At a news briefing, Roque also said he would announce on Tuesday the resignation of another government official.Roque said he did not know the President’s sister whom Tolentino talked with, but the fired official identified her as Jocelyn Duterte.“The termination of Tolentino serves as an example that if the President said do not talk with his relatives or friends, you should not talk to them,” Roque said.The spokesman added that it seemed that Tolentino had used the Duterte family in justifying the Mindanao Railway Project.MisunderstoodAfter his unceremonious firing, Tolentino insisted that he was misunderstood.“I wasn’t name-dropping the first family to push for an agenda. I just sought their advice on something which I think is within the interest of Mindanao,” he said.Even so, Tolentino said he “respect[ed]” the decision of the President, who appointed him to the post in December 2017.In the press briefing on May 18, Tolentino gave updates on the railroad project in which he ended up accusing certain DOTr officials of deliberately delaying it by pushing for a loan from China to fund the first phase.FinancingInitially, Phase 1 of the project, which aims to lay down 1,500 kilometers of rail connecting key cities in Mindanao, was supposed to be financed through the national budget.Transportation Undersecretary for Railways Timothy James Batan admitted the DOTr was considering contracting a loan from China so it would be easier to tap additional loans for the financing of succeeding phases of the project.The DOTr shot down Tolentino’s allegations and accused the assistant secretary of arrogance when he claimed he was “only accountable to the President” and that he had the “blessing” of members of the first family.In an interview, Tolentino said he did not talk to Jocelyn Duterte to seek her favor or to lobby for anything regarding the project, but merely to discuss its progress.He said he used to serve as legal counsel for the President’s sister.On scheduleIn a statement released on Monday, the DOTr sought to ease fears about delays in the Mindanao Railway Project.“The Mindanao Railway, a priority project under the ‘Build, Build, Build’ infrastructure program of the Duterte administration, is on track and on schedule,” the statement said.It added that the first phase of the railroad, which will connect three key cities in the Davao region (Tagum, Davao and Digos), would be finished by 2021 “without delays and without corruption.”Batan told reporters that the tension between Tolentino and other DOTr officials began last Wednesday, when the latter insisted that he hold a press conference on the project.China-PH meeting“I told him to postpone it first, because there are ongoing discussions not only among Philippine government agencies, but also government to government between China and the Philippines,” Batan said.Batan said he thought this was clear to Tolentino, which was why he was surprised to learn the next day that the press conference was pushing through.Batan also said Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua would be meeting with Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade on Monday about funding for the project.“From the very beginning the plan has been to ask for assistance, especially for the future phases of the Mindanao Railway,” Batan said.He said it was the DOTr’s Chinese partners that had expressed interest in the railway project.",1
"His unexpected visit took them by surprise.But for the grief-stricken families of the 44 Special Action Force (SAF) commandos killed in a clash with Moro rebels in Mamasapano, Maguindanao province, on Jan. 25, it was President Benigno Aquino III’s failure to answer questions about his role in that tragic counterterrorism operation that left them stunned.Janet Carap, widow of PO2 Peterson Carap, said the “most important questions” about the disastrous police operation remain unanswered as Mr. Aquino kept mum during their unscheduled, six-hour dialogue with him at Camp Crame, the national headquarters of the Philippine National Police in Quezon City, on Wednesday night.“I’m not contented because he did not answer my questions,” Carap told the Inquirer after the meeting with the President at the Camp Crame Multipurpose Center.“I want to know what really happened, who made the mistake and who should be held accountable for the death of my husband and the others. For me, that’s much more important than the livelihood and other assistance they promised us,” she said.“The most important questions he should answer are what did he do after learning about the incident, what did he do to save his people. Those 44 men and the other members of our security forces fought for this country,” she said, raising her voice.“Is this country worth fighting for if that is the only kind of support our security forces get? Is it OK for the government to lose many of its men just for the life of one terrorist?” she said.“The government is not telling us what they are going to do to give us justice. It’s not easy for us to accept that the lives of our loved ones are worth the life of Marwan,” she added.Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias “Marwan,” was killed by the commandos during the operation in the early hours of Jan. 25 in Tukanalipao village, Mamasapano, but his Filipino lieutenant Basit Usman, though wounded, managed to escape.As they withdrew from the village, the commandos engaged in gun battles with guerrillas from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).Mr. Aquino stayed longest at the table of the relatives of SPO1 Lover Inocencio, Insp. Joey Gamutan, PO1 Oliebeth Viernes and PO2 Rodel Ramacula.At one point, Mr. Aquino was seen showing text messages on his cell phone and several documents to the families.ReinforcementsInocencio’s widow, Liezel, said they asked the President if he had ordered the deployment of reinforcements to help the SAF commandos.She said the President told them that the information on the Mamasapano incident was relayed to him by the SAF commander, Director Getulio Napeñas, who had taken responsibility for the PNP’s worst operational debacle in recent years.“He showed us the text (message) of Sir Napeñas. It was sent to him around 7 a.m. (of Jan. 25). He said he had sent reinforcements,” Liezel said.Mena Ramacula, mother of the slain SAF trooper, said the President also told them how he was being blamed for the incident, which had clearly affected the Aquino administration’s four-year efforts to seal a final peace agreement with the MILF.The MILF, the biggest secessionist group in Mindanao, has admitted that some of its members were involved in the clash with the SAF commandos.Hard to answerAsked if she thought Mr. Aquino should take the blame for the death of the commandos, Mena said: “No comment. It’s hard to answer that question.”Forty-four SAF commandos, 18 MILF rebels, and five civilians were killed in fighting that lasted 12 hours.The SAF did not inform the military and the MILF, which has signed a peace agreement with the government, about the law-enforcement operation. Coordination with the joint ceasefire committee would have prevented a clash between the government forces and the Moro rebels—or have compromised the mission, as feared by Napeñas, who was sacked over the debacle.Napeñas said he called for military reinforcement as the fighting raged, but no help came.The military said a rescue mission was organized, but Napeñas could not determine the location of his pinned down troopers. It was already too late when they were finally located.Mr. Aquino has admitted having knowledge of the operation, but has never said how much he knows about it and who gave the order for it to proceed.Waiting for informationThe families of the slain SAF commandos have been waiting for him to inform them what really happened that the operation ended up in a bloodbath and who are responsible.Wednesday was the second time Mr. Aquino met with the families of the slain commandos, who had been hailed by the government and by netizens for their bravery in tracking down one of the most wanted terrorists in the world.Joined by senior government officials, Mr. Aquino hopped from one table to another as he talked with the families, spending at least 30 minutes to listen to their concerns.Relatives of at least three commandos occupied each table.Skipped wedding partyMr. Aquino, who arrived before 6 p.m. and left at midnight, skipped the wedding reception of his close friend and political ally, Sen. Francis “Chiz” Escudero, and actress Heart Evangelista to be with the families.The President had been pilloried in social media when he chose to attend the opening of a car manufacturing plant in Sta. Rosa City, Laguna province, than join the heroes’ welcome for the dead policemen at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on Jan. 28.Mr. Aquino tried to make up for it by spending 13 hours with the families after necrological services for the slain commandos at SAF headquarters in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, on Jan. 30.Speaking with reporters after the grueling marathon meeting on Wednesday night, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said the President decided not to attend Escudero’s wedding party after he informed the Chief Executive that relatives of the slain SAF troopers were in Camp Crame.“He changed his schedule to be here. He ordered the Cabinet members to address the needs of the families and not to let these concerns be buried by the bureaucracy and documentary requirements,” Roxas said.Failure to controlCarap, who traveled from Baguio City to attend the event originally scheduled as a “one-stop” assistance program for the beneficiaries of the SAF troopers, sat along with the families of PO2 Noble Kiangan and two other slain officers from Benguet province.During their conversation, Carap said she asked Mr. Aquino why he failed to control the situation in Mamasapano when he clearly had the authority as Commander in Chief of the military and the police.She said the President replied, “If you are the president of a company composed of, say, 8,000 employees, can you control all of your people?”“If I were to answer his question, I would say yes because you are the boss, you are the leader. You should have control over your people,” she said.Explaining what happened on that fateful day, the President, she said, showed them the text messages on his mobile phone about the information he received on the Mamasapano clash.Carap said Mr. Aquino admitted that he knew what was going on in Mamasapano as early as 7 a.m. and that he was in contact with security officials on the ground.He could’ve done moreCarap said it was difficult to accept the way her husband died, insisting that Mr. Aquino could have done more to save the lives of the SAF commandos who were outnumbered and pinned down by heavily armed Moro rebels in a vast cornfield in Tukanalipao.Said Carap: “Admittedly, we all need the livelihood assistance that the government has promised us. I will not turn it down because of pride. But I would prefer knowing the truth because we can still work and earn money.”“What’s more painful is the fact that our questions are not answered. There are still question marks,” she added.Arguing with AquinoJournalists were initially allowed to cover the meeting from the viewing deck of the multipurpose center. But staff members of the Palace press office shooed away the reporters around 10 p.m. after some of the relatives were seen arguing with Mr. Aquino.One of the women was seen cupping her ears as if in disgust or as if she did not want to listen to what the President was saying.“It was at that table where the President was met with some kind of resistance as the relatives raised more difficult questions,” an Inquirer source said.One of the text messages that the President showed to the relatives came from a certain “Mar,” apparently Roxas.The message read: “The containment blocking force was engaged 2 kms east of Tukanalipao GC [grid coordinates]. There was heavy firefight & SAF troops suffered casualties. Extraction ongoing & support troops from AFP was requested.”It was not clear when “Mar” sent the message to Mr. Aquino.Roxas, who was reportedly not informed about the Mamasapano operations, and Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin had told the Senate inquiry into the Jan. 25 clash that they did not inform the President about the Mamasapano incident.Follow throughMalacañang said Mr. Aquino’s surprise visit to the families of the slain SAF commandos on Wednesday night was a “follow through on the delivery of the assistance” the President promised them two weeks ago.Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said the President went to Camp Crame with his Cabinet officials to “ensure that with top level commitment, the families will be assisted to rebuild their lives and to fulfill the dreams of our SAF 44 heroes.”Coloma indicated that the President was willing to submit his account of the botched operation to the Philippine National Police’s board of inquiry. But Coloma did not say when the “right time” was for Mr. Aquino to do this.“The overall mind-set of the President is to get a complete narrative and the whole truth that’s why he is ready to do what is needed to achieve this objective,” Coloma told reporters.Coloma added that the assistance include educational scholarships, livelihood and employment, and health services.When asked if the families of the five civilians killed during the clash would receive the same attention from the government, Coloma said the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) had been tasked “to ascertain their needs and extend the necessary assistance.”The DSWD would coordinate with the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao authorities as well as the local government units, Coloma said.He also gave assurance that other soldiers and policemen who had been killed in the line of duty would be given the same attention by the government as given to the families of the slain SAF officers.

"SUPREME COURT RULING SETS PRECEDENTTHE Supreme Court (SC) has affirmed a ruling of the Court of Appeals (CA) ordering the reinstatement of a police colonel involved in a supposed helicopter scam, giving way to jurisprudence that the reinstatement of a dismissed public officer shall be immediately executory pending appeal.Police Supt. Ermilando Villafuerte was ordered by the SC to be reinstated to the service after being cleared in the Philippine National Police’s (PNP) allegedly anomalous purchase of second-hand helicopters in 2009 and 2010.In the ruling approved by then-Chief Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro, the full court held that the appellate court was right when it ruled that the Office of the Ombudsman was wrong in finding Villafuerte liable for PNP’s contract with supplier Hilario de Vera of Manila Aerospace Products Trading Corp. (Maptra).The SC en banc ruling dated Sept. 18, 2018 was penned by Associate Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa, a copy of which was obtained by The Manila Times.The ruling effectively denied a plea of the PNP-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (PNP-CIDG) questioning the CA decisions made on Jan. 28, 2015 and Aug. 3, 2015.It said there was no proof of conspiracy on Villafuerte’s part.The assailed Ombudsman order also ordered the dismissal of 12 other PNP officials and personnel: Chief Supt. Herold Ubalde, Chief Supt. Luis Saligumba, Supt. Roman Loreto, Senior Supt. Job Nolan Antonio, Director George Piano, Senior Supt. Edgar Paatan, Senior Supt. Mansue Lukban, Chief Inspector Maria Josefina Vidal Recometa, Senior Supt. Claudio Gaspar Jr., and Senior Police Officers 3 Ma. Linda Padojinog, Avensuel Dy and Ruben Gongona.Still six others were also ordered suspended for six months without pay: Senior Supt. Joel Crisostomo Garcia, SPO3 Jorge Gabiana, PO3 Dionisio Jimenez, and non-uniformed personnel Erwin Chavarria, Emilia Aliling and Erwin Paul Maranan.The CA had granted petitions for review separately filed by police superintendents Roman Loreto and Villafuerte.The PNP programmed to purchase three fully equipped helicopters with an approved budget of P105 million in 2009.The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of the PNP awarded the contract to Maptra for the purchase of Robinson R44 helicopters in February 2010 until an investigation revealed later that the helicopters bought were not brand-new, contrary to requirements of the PNP procurement program.The Ombudsman found the petitioners and several officers of the PNP guilty of serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and ordered their dismissal from the service with forfeiture of all benefits and precluding them from employment in any branch or service of the government including government-owned and -controlled corporations.Their motions for reconsideration were denied, prompting them to seek redress with the appellate court.In its rulings, the CA pointed out that the Ombudsman made sweeping conclusions against Loreto and Villafuerte, whose silence supposedly amounted to participation in an alleged conspiracy.This prompted the PNP-CIDG to seek redress with the high court.The SC decision denied the PNP-CIDG’s appeal as it affirmed the rulings of the appellate court.It affirmed the CA decision holding that Villafuerte was neither part of the team that inspected the procured helicopters nor were he and Loreto signatories in disbursement vouchers for payment of the choppers.“To be sure, the cleansing of our ranks cannot be done at the expense of a fair and just proceeding,” the SC ruling stated.“All told, the court is not prepared to punish respondent Villafuerte for merely discharging the ministerial functions of his office as member of the BAC Secretariat, especially when such acts were made pursuant to the instructions of his superiors.”“Accordingly, this decision shall be immediately executory insofar as the reinstatement of [Villafuerte] to his former position is concerned, which shall be without loss of seniority rights and with payment of backwages and all benefits which would have accrued as if he had not been illegally dismissed, following Section 58 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,” the court said.",1

This is why we are expected to enjoy what life has to offer.Considering the average life expectancy of Filipinos, it would probably be amazing if we get to meet people who reach a hundred years old and still live.

"Malacañang on Thursday maintained that there was no “pork barrel” hidden in the proposed national budget for 2019 amid allegations of questionable allocations.Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. made the assurance after Sen. Panfilo “Ping” Lacson claimed that there were “hundreds of billions of pesos” in the proposed budget that could be considered as “pork.”“The President [Rodrigo Duterte] is unrelenting in his campaign against graft and corruption and he does not condone pork barrel. We guarantee you it is pork-free,” Roque told reporters.“I leave it to Senator Lacson because he is a legislator. He knows what he talks about. My stint in Congress was too short to actually know what he is talking about but he has had three terms in Congress, he knows better,” he added.Lacson was reported to have confirmed the existence of pork barrel or the lawmakers’ Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) in next year’s proposed budget.“If you think pork has left, no it hasn’t. It runs to hundreds of billions of pesos,” he was quoted as saying.The senator raised the alarm after Speaker Gloria Arroyo assured congressmen they would not have “zero budget” for their respective districts.In 2013, the Supreme Court declared PDAF unconstitutional.The court said these funds allowed lawmakers to identify projects after the national budget had been passed.",1
"The Land Transportation Office (LTO) is set to meet tint manufacturers this week to determine the allowable grade of tints for cars.“Assistant Secretary [LTO chief Ed] Galvante will talk to tint manufacturers this week to determine which grade of tint is allowable,” Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board spokesman Aileen Lizada said in a radio interview on Sunday.Lizada advised motorists not to tint their cars heavily until the allowable grade is determined.Earlier, Galvante said motorists whose cars are tinted than what is allowed should also face sanctions under the newly implemented Anti-Distracted Driving Law.According to the law, motorists are not allowed to use any gadgets while driving, or even when caught in traffic.Accessories such as stuffed toys and figurines, among others, blocking the field of view of the driver are also prohibited under Land Transportation Office (LTO)- LTFRB Joint Administrative Order 2014-01.“What we are implementing, even though we find it sometimes difficult, we are just complying with the mandate given to us,” according to Lizada.In a text message to the media over the weekend, she said the LTFRB is suggesting that an information drive be conducted simultaneously with enforcement of the Anti-Distracted Driving Law (Republic Act or RA 10913).“It would be good though to focus on the purpose of the law, which is safe driving practices,” Lizada.The Highway Patrol Group is deputized to catch violators of the law.Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is set to gather evidence such as a screen grab, which it will submit to the LTO.The LTO will, in turn, issue notices to the violators of RA 10913.First offense will be penalized P5, 000; second offense, P10,000; and third offense, P15,000 and suspension of driving license for three months.Fourth and succeeding offenses will result in a fine of P20,000 and revocation of drivers’ license.REICELENE JOY N.

"In the days that followed the horrific devastation wrought by Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) in his district, Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez felt his nightmares were better than reality.“I had nightmares every night. But you could not have a nightmare that could capture the devastation and destruction around. When I woke up, it’s real, and it’s even worse,” Romualdez said, eyes wide open, both hands on his head as he recalled the devastation that his district suffered in November 2013.It had just been a year since “the darkest time” of his life, when he lost his father, former Leyte Gov. Benjamin “Kokoy” Romualdez.But for the lawmaker, the still unquantifiable loss in his district, in lives and property, caused him “a thousand times more grief and sense of loss.”It did not take long though for the horror to turn into hope. It was malasakit, that deep sense of caring and concern, that soon started to lift the pall of gloom from Tacloban City and wherever the devastation stretched.“After Yolanda, I saw malasakit. That’s the reason why we were able to bounce back,” Romualdez said in an interview on Inquirer Live on Wednesday night.“Filipinos helping other Filipinos. That’s what I saw. That’s the secret ingredient. It’s something very natural, and that was what created this whole wave, like a storm surge of help, the assistance that brought us to where we are today,” he said.Giving backThe desire to give back to those who came to his district’s aid in Yolanda’s wake and the drive to instill the cherished value in the younger generation of Filipinos is the fuel that runs Romualdez’s bid for a seat in the Senate, a first foray into national politics for the 52-year-old member of Leyte’s most prominent political family.“As I went around the city, amid the death and destruction, you could still see the humanity of the Taclobanons trying to help one another. Everybody was traumatized, everybody was a victim,” Romualdez said.“Despite all of that, you could see Filipinos helping one another, lifting one another, literally. The dead, the wounded, the helpless,” said the lawmaker, who shuttled back and forth between Manila and Tacloban at the height of relief operations after the typhoon.The city where “everybody was a victim,” where those who survived roamed in a daze in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, soon became a city of survivors raring to rebuild.“And that struck me. Initially, everybody was like a zombie. But as soon as they were back to their consciousness, they started helping each other,” Romualdez said.“It’s very easy to lose hope. But we were brought up to have faith in God and the humanity of the people. It shone through. I’d like to look at that. We learn from that and at the same time celebrate the positive side of all of this,” he said.Unrepresented in SenateGunning for the Senate after three terms in the House of Representatives, Romualdez hopes to bring malasakit across the country, especially to regions similarly situated as Eastern Visayas, where he said government projects were largely “underfunded.”Eastern Visayas has not had a representative in the Senate for six decades, the last one being the late Sen. Decoroso Rosales of Calbayog City, who was elected in 1955.“It’s been 60 years since our region was represented in the Senate. And now, our region is the most challenged in terms of funding and development. It’s no coincidence perhaps with no representative, that’s why we’re not properly attended to,” he said.Romualdez said his granduncle, Norberto Romualdez, ran for the Senate but died “at the height of the election season” in 1958.“That’s my selfish personal reason for running. It’s an unfulfilled dream for the family,” he said later in a separate interview.Although he grew up in a privileged family, Romualdez’s propensity to help was shaped early when, as a boy, he saw the disparity between the rich and the poor.“I’d see people sleeping on the streets, and I was there in the car with my mom, we had a driver, and I saw how much more I had in life,” said Romualdez, who remembered how he wanted to provide housing for the homeless when he was younger.It is a virtue that is gradually lost in the young, a generation for whom many things are “transactional,” and everything is done in exchange for something, he said.“We want to imbue this generation with this virtue. This generation forgets the bayanihan spirit. When we were much younger, that’s what we talked about: People helping each other to move a nipa hut. That’s the malasakit of our generation,” Romualdez said.“We want to share and celebrate that because we feel we don’t have enough of it. We want to go back to that Filipino spirit that’s almost infectious. We want to spread that around, because we saw that that was the key to our recovery (in Eastern Visayas],” he said.‘Malasakit’ platformIf given the chance to serve in the Senate, Romualdez, a lawyer, vowed to introduce legislation that would concretize his malasakit platform.For one, inspired by his Yolanda experience, Romualdez would propose the creation of a separate department on disaster risk reduction (DRR) and management to strengthen preparation and response efforts.Such a department would help speed up action and further focus efforts on DRR, as the next disaster is “not a matter of if, but when,” given the undeniable effects of climate change.Romualdez would also introduce legislation that would institutionalize the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), the conditional cash transfer system initiated by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and continued by President Aquino.“We want to institutionalize that program so that it would be the right of the poor. We will get rid of palakasan (influence-peddling) and politicking, which allows those who should not be in the program to receive the cash transfers,” he said.He would also pursue implementation of a piece of legislation he was “very proud” of: the bill providing tax exemptions, discounts and other benefits for people with disabilities.Romualdez would also support farmers by “doing away with irrigation fees,” move for the improvement of the country’s Internet service, and call for a more consultative process in crafting a law for the envisioned Bangsamoro region.Although waging an independent campaign, Romualdez has risen in the polls. His name also appears on the sample ballot being circulated on social media by Iglesia ni Cristo followers, indicating he has won the backing of the bloc-voting Christian sect.Romualdez’s senatorial bid has been strategic, as most presidential candidates have adopted him without requiring him to endorse them. Behind his candidacy are Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, Vice President Jejomar Binay and Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago.“Actually it’s quite easy because when I was invited to be a guest candidate on their senatorial slates, I was pleasantly surprised that there were no conditions. I thought, let’s say if Mayor Duterte invited me, he would say I should support him. But there’s nothing like that,” Romualdez said.Rallies ‘à la carte’He was also given the freedom to choose which rallies he would join, and used the leeway to his advantage. In his words, he took on rallies “à la carte,” given the flexibility to “transcend political lines.”“What I do is, depending on the schedules, I look at the areas I have visited or have not visited, the areas that are strengths of these presidential candidates, and I would choose my rallies,” he said.“Like for instance, if I have a schedule with Mayor Duterte in Mindanao, I obviously would like to go there because he’s very popular there. If in Makati I’m invited by Vice President Binay, I might as well come because it’s his bailiwick,” he said.The campaign has taken him away from his family, but the father of four said the experience has brought him to corners of the country he otherwise would not have seen.“Had I not decided to run, I would not have seen how beautiful this country is and how beautiful Filipinos are,” he said.“That’s why I can’t turn my back on the people not just in my region but Filipinos in other regions who need help. They gave us help during Yolanda, and this is my opportunity to serve them. I am ready to serve them and that’s what I really want to do: to give back something in return for the malasakit that they showed us,” he said.RELATED STORIESRomualdez on Roxas: Let’s not dwell on ‘Yolanda’ shortcomingsRomualdez: Return to 2-party system a ‘good suggestion’RELATED VIDEOS",1
"Malacañang on Thursday said it will not hand over money to bandit groups in exchange of their captives’ freedom.The statement came after an alleged faction of the Abu Sayyaf threatened to behead a village chair and two members of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).“Government maintains its no-ransom policy,” Communications Secretery Herminio Coloma Jr. said in a text message to media.Instead, he forwarded a statement from PCG spokesperson Cdr.

"The U.S. Supreme Court just handed down an order staying a Utah lower court’s decision recognizing that the Constitution forbids marriage discrimination . Though Utah requested that Justice Sonia Sotomayor issue the stay on her own, the Court’s order indicates that she referred the decision to the full Court. No justice indicated a dissent, although that does not necessarily mean that all nine justices would have granted the stay.Today’s decision which put same-sex marriages in Utah on hold, upset many in the lgbt community and activists in the marriage equality movement, especially because they always thought that Sotomayor, an Obama appointee, was an ally and considered her one of the radical justices on the Supreme Court.In a statement issued late today, Sotomayor admitted that she is actually a closeted conservative and that she regrets having misled those in the U.S. Senate who voted for her confirmation thinking she was pro-women’s rights, pro-gay rights, pro-abortion, and pro-everything radical.The presumptive lgbt lead organization, the Human Rights Campaign, is still crafting its response to the Sotomayor announcement.

"As a signatory to the Rome Statute, the Philippines is obligated to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC)—the same assertion President Duterte’s spokesperson had made in a bill he filed when he was still a party-list congressman, an opposition lawmaker said on Friday.Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said the statute required the country to cooperate with the ICC prosecutor’s inquiry into the Duterte administration’s bloody war on drugs.Crimes against humanityThe President, he added, could not “hinder” the preliminary examination by the ICC Office of the Prosecutor of the complaint, accusing him of committing crimes against humanity in the government’s drug war that had claimed the lives of thousands of drug suspects.“Neither can Duterte challenge the ICC’s jurisdiction over him by foisting the country’s sovereignty,” Lagman said in a statement.The lawmaker reminded Mr. Duterte’s spokesperson, Harry Roque, that the latter had, in fact, filed a bill invoking the country’s obligations to the ICC when he was still the Kabayan party-list lawmaker.In filing House Bill 2835, Lagman quoted Roque as saying that as a “party to the Rome Statute, the Philippines must fulfill its international legal obligations to assist the Court in the task of addressing the most serious crimes of international concern.”Thus, “even as he is the President’s anointed apologist, Roque cannot flip-flop without remorse, and forfeit any of his remaining credibility,” said the leader of the antiadministration “Magnificent Seven” in the House of Representatives.ComplementarityThe principle of complementarity that Roque had said would prevent the ICC from hearing the cases against Mr. Duterte could actually be hurdled by recognizing that local courts were also bound by the doctrine of presidential immunity from suit, according to a coalition of human rights lawyers.“We cannot prosecute the President here while he is President. [So] there’s no obstacle to the ICC taking jurisdiction of the case,” said Jose Manuel Diokno, convenor of the “Manlaban sa EJK” coalition and chair of the Free Legal Assistance Group.Unwilling to actDiokno was among the participants in Wednesday’s “Rise, Resist, Unite against Tokhang and Tyranny” forum at the University of the Philippines College of Law in Quezon City.The principle of complementarity means that the ICC can only hear a case if the courts in a concerned state are unable or unwilling to act on a certain case.Former Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Neri Colmenares said four patterns made the alleged extrajudicial killings under the government’s war on drugs “state-sponsored.”“[There is] public villification of targets, increased surveillance and operations on targets, the complete impunity with which crimes were committed, and the complete lack of interest to investigate and prosecute on the part of government,” Colmenares said.Under Article 86 of the Rome Statute, “States Parties shall … cooperate fully with the Court in its investigation and prosecution of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court.”The Philippines became a state party to the Rome Statute when then President Benigno Aquino III signed it on Feb. 28, 2011 and the Senate gave its concurrence on Aug. 23, 2011.",1
"formulated in 2011 would be realized in 2016. The 2016 outcomes speak for themselves. The color code used for reporting on outcome flashed an “all green” report.Beyond having clear core values and a lofty mission, what ways did the Santos family follow to come up with such a performance report after 5 years? The answer: The ways are not altogether secret: they are no different from the usual ways of ensuring that the spouses positively bring a positive contribution to the family each day; that spouse-to-spouse relationships are kept healthy; and that relationships with each of the kids (and among the kids) are kept always on a friendly footing. In practice, what do all these mean?Based on the narrative of the dad, the Santos family adopted a few “projects” for the family to undertake during the 5-year period, 2011-2016. These are: project excellence (do excellently at school and at work); strengthening family traditions (dinner, playing Settlers of Catan – a favorite board game of the family, and having periodic family councils); preparation for the next level of schooling (from grade school to high school, from high school to college, and then graduate school); acquisition and practice of household skills (the kids gradually do more and more of the home chores); and finally learning of Spanish (in preparation for a trip to Mexico in 2016). It is never enough to specify projects; it is also absolutely necessary to specify a strategy map, which is translated into a set of performance scorecards.The Santos’ family strategy map is of special interest. It has three headlines, which capture the strategic themes that the family projects must serve. Those themes have been articulated as: Build character;best effort always; and do what we ought. And this is where the not-so-secret ways of the Santos family get to be fully revealed.At bottom, they put a lot of attention and effort to building and strengthening the family culture. This means in even more specific terms: spending a lot of rich time with each other; going to Mass on Sunday as a family and having Sunday lunch together; and holding a quarterly “family council” to reinforce the family traditions.Then comes “learning and growth” especially on the part of the kids: a lot of study, combined with doing household chores. There is also some writing (of a personal journal and of letters to each other in the family), plus tutoring of each other (and others beyond the family). All these are not enough. They need to be complemented with “resource capability priorities” such as: “steady money” (job for the dad, and savings); “guard time” (an expression for not wasting time and using time well, concretized in no TV and no video games); “keep healthy” (this is where exercise comes in along with healthy food); then the two absolute “musts”, which are: “track and review performance”; and “seeking God’s help” (i.e., praying coupled with studying and working well).Obviously, the Santos family is not a full enclosure unto itself. The members also have to carry out an outreach program. This consists mainly of “knowing more people,” and “developing friendship” with others including those from outside the family.These are pretty “standard” stuff for any normal family that aims to remain healthy and happy, with everyone becoming more accomplished and a greater asset not only for the family but also for society. But in the case of the Santos family, such standard stuff has been deployed and put to good, regular use and observance, and it must be added “with much fun and great sense of humor”.Except for the learning of Spanish project (but with the Mexico trip still done), all the family projects were executed, with great success in the end. A good example to emulate!",1
"and asked that the youth do their part.“Embrace the opportunities presented to you with hard work. I’m sure you’ve heard this many times from your parents but this time it comes from the President of the Philippines: Study hard. All the support is there, but I cannot learn for you,” he said.“ Finish your homework before the raid in Clash of Clans. Because like I said, you will be the one to continue all this,” Aquino saidImmediately after his speech, Aquino returned to Manila and signed an executive order authorizing the Philippines’ Telecommunications Agency (PTA) to block Facebook access by all Filipinos under the age of 21. The E.O. also deputizes the National Bureau of Investigation and Philippine National Police to ensure the strict implementation of the new law.Aquino, however, said that his Facebook page is exempted from the order which means that Filipinos of all ages are free to access the presidential page.To date, Aquino’s Facebook page has 4 Million followers. That’s a disappointing 4 % of the entire population of the Philippines which critics say is an accurate reflection the president’s very low performance rating.",0
"I watched Round 2 of the presidential debates (dubbed #PilipinasDebates2016) last night. It was really entertaining! Mar Roxas was clearly on the run, chased by the disarming wit and articulateness of Rodrigo Duterte and Grace Poe. Vice President Jojo Binay was also pretty sharp and, for a guy who prepared notes but wasn’t allowed to use them, he was able to come back with facts and put lawyerly order in the exchange of arguments.Bottom line, I think, is that Roxas being some sort of conyo kid (even if he doesn’t look like he smells like one) was no match for the snappy street-style comebacks of streetsmart Binay and Duterte and was out-charmed by the showbiz aura of Grace Poe.But that was the entertainment bit. I have to say, I struggled when I took stock of what real insights on the issues I actually gained from this debate. And then I saw Teddy Boy Locsin’s tweet…Tagalog should be discouraged. So long, so bullshitty, so useless a tongue for debate.…and then it hit me. There was so much time and verbage that was sunk into the intellectual blackhole that is the Tagalog dialect. I mean, hey, Tagalog is nice when you are watching a Vice Ganda standup act or a Kris Aquino kiriring talk-fest. But when you are doing a debate on important issues, Tagalog is not really an intellectualized enough dialect to do justice to such topics.(As a side note, I’d also lose those idiotic theme songs that screech in every commercial break. What is this, a debate or a teleserye??)I kinda found it ironic actually. Here is Wharton “grad” Roxas fixated on speaking in Tagalog trying to look maka-masa, while Duterte and Binay masterfully laced their rhetoric with English whenever the message became technical. What’s funny is that nobody really buys Roxas’s local-speaking pretensions. Not only does him speaking in Tagalog come across as fake, he has a track record of dumb displays of actually physically pandering to pang-masa sensibilities, what with photo ops of him carrying a sack of onions, directing traffic, and driving a nail into a public school desk.What makes it doubly-difficult as well is that Roxas, like Duterte, is bisaya — which means he is as predisposed to coming across as bastos (rude) when speaking in Tagalog as most Bisaya people are wont to be. Maybe this is the reason why Roxas comes across as mayabang and condescending — because (1) he insists on speaking in Tagalog and (2) he is a Bisaya speaking in Tagalog.That’s actually another credit to Duterte. He is also Bisaya, but he manages to piece together Tagalog sentences and deliver them with a bit more class. Of course, I don’t mean class in the sense of refinement. I mean class in that Duterte’s Tagalog is endearing rather than offensive like Roxas’s. You can see it in the audience’s warm response whenever Duterte speaks. When it is Roxas and his half-assed Tagalog, he tends to attract a chilly tentative reception.As Locsin observed, this whole layer of Tagalog that weighs down our country’s political discourse like a sticky layer of lard is plain bullshittery. All the use of the Tagalog dialect by Filipino politicians achieves is wrap unnecessary overhead and noise around the already faint signal of substance political discourse in the Philippines delivers. Furthermore, Tagalog is a stark reminder to the conquered peoples of the Visayas and Mindanao of the shadow cast upon them by Imperial Manila and their Tagalog-speaking overlords. It is a divisive dialect that, as is becoming more evident as our politics evolves more diversity, no longer should have a place in polite and intelligent discussion.",0
"HE MUST be a romantic at heart. And maybe a comedian, too.In a no-holds-barred speech before 10,000 supporters on Sunday night in Taguig City, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo “Digong” Duterte opened up about his personal life, speaking not only of having two wives but of two girlfriends, as well.When he was younger, the 70-year-old presidential aspirant said, he would spend the whole night with his girlfriends, but since he had grown older, he could spend only “short time” with them.The crowd apparently enjoyed his speech, cheering, applauding, laughing and at times shouting with glee.Duterte spoke at the end of a “MAD (Musicians and Artists for Duterte) for Change” concert around 10 p.m., hours later than originally planned because he said his flight was delayed.He said the public needed to know everything about him, including his love life and interest in women, if they want to make him President.Fascinated with womenDuterte, who said among other things that corruption would have no place in his administration, admitted his fascination for women.The presidential aspirant was seen greeting and approaching beautiful women as he made his way to the stage to speak, breaking security protocol.He also had photos taken with him while women sat on his lap.“Many are asking what my credentials are and what I can do for the Philippines,” he said when he spoke. “They are telling me that they heard I am a womanizer. That is true. That is very true.”Two wivesOf his two wives, he said: “I have a wife who is sick. Then I have a second wife, who is from Bulacan.”He said his second wife worked as a nurse in the United States and that she got pregnant after his frequent trips to that country, when he was still a congressman.“I have two girlfriends. One is working as a cashier and the other works for a cosmetics store at a mall. The one working at the cosmetics store is younger. The other one is older but more beautiful.”“If you want me to become your President, you should know everything about me,” he said, standing beside Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano, the vice presidential candidate he plans to run with in the 2016 elections.Personal moneyDuterte, however, made it clear that even if he was a known ladies’ man, he didn’t use government money to support his women.“I do not support them with the money from the government but from my own money and allowances,” Duterte said.“I do not let them live in posh condominium units. They just stay in boardinghouses worth P1,500 a month.”‘Younger one’Duterte said “the younger one” once asked him for a repossessed car “but I did not agree because I told her that our travels just include trips from her boardinghouse to a hotel.”Duterte claimed that when he was younger, he would stay overnight with a girlfriend “but now I am old, it would only be for ‘short time,’” he said, amid laughter.Duterte drew cheers from the crowd composed mostly of his supporters from various parts of Metro Manila, like Caloocan City, Quezon City, Muntinlupa City and Taguig City.",1
" No casino will operate on Boracay Island, which will be closed to tourism for six months so it can be rehabilitated, President Duterte declared on Monday.To the surprise of many, the President also declared the 1,032-hectare resort island an agrarian reform area, saying under the law, the country’s premier tourist destination is an agricultural and forest area.“I did not say I will allow casino there somewhere. Far from it actually. I never said anything about building anything or even a nipa hut there,” Mr. Duterte said.He made the statement before leaving for Hainan, China, in reaction to reports the government would allow a casino to be built on the island, which he called a “cesspool” in February.After Malacañang announced on April 5 that Boracay would be shut down for six months starting April 26, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV said the closure was meant to pave the way for the construction of a casino.Two casinosTwo major casinos on Boracay Island have been approved by state-owned Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor).Pagcor has approved a $500-million integrated casino resort of Macau’s Galaxy Entertainment Group and its local partner, AB Leisure Exponent Inc., a unit of the publicly listed Leisure and Resorts World Corp.Resorts World Manila also plans to start gaming operations at the Savoy Hotel, a component of Megaworld Corp.’s Boracay Coast development.In his departure press conference in Davao City, the President noted that the island was owned by the government.“It’s agricultural and forestal. Unless there is a law or proclamation by the President setting aside anything there, an inch of land maybe, then that would be all right for other people to go in,” he said.But because there was no such proclamation, Mr. Duterte said the law remained and that Boracay was a government property.“I’ll place it under [the] land reform [program]. It would be better. I will tell you now, ‘I will give it to farmers. I will give them tractors,’” the President said.SC ruling, GMA declarationA Supreme Court ruling in 2008 declared the island state-owned. Rejecting ownership claims of several resort owners, the high court said the island, which it classified as forested and agricultural, belonged to the government.On May 22, 2006, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued Presidential Proclamation No. 1064 that categorized 628.96 ha, or 60.94 percent of the island, as alienable and disposable, and the rest as forest land and protected areas.Most of the areas classified as public lands are occupied by residential and commercial structures.Claimants of public lands will have to wait for 30 years after the land is declared alienable and disposable before they can apply for titling, according to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).Mr. Duterte said he did not care about moneyed people or businesses that would be displaced by his decision to declare Boracay an agrarian reform area.Help for poor“You’ll ask me what about the businesses? I’m sorry, the law says it’s agricultural. Why would I deviate from that?” he said.The President said the poor, who would be affected by his closure order, would get help from the government.“If you’re asking financial help, I’m going to sign a proclamation of calamity and I can make available P2 billion of assistance but this is only for the poor Filipino,” he said.The President said various government agencies were helping in the cleanup.After the cleanup, Mr, Duterte said he “would return” Boracay to the Filipino people.“It’s going to be a land reform area. I do not have any plan to [put up] casinos there. I will give it to the people who need it most,” he said.Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu is also against casinos in Boracay.“No [to the casinos]. There are so many other places to put those up. Why [in Boracay] when we’re already working so hard to clean it up?” Cimatu said on Friday at the DENR central office in Quezon City.",1
"Vice President Jejomar Binay on Saturday again raised the issue of bad governance against the Aquino administration as he continued his trips outside his bailiwick, this time to Valenzuela City, stronghold of the Gatchalian family.“Our problem is bad governance. The people continue to be impoverished and many do not have jobs. That is our problem. This is what we will solve,” he said in a speech before Valenzuela residents.He said that he and Valenzuela Rep. Sherwin Gatchalian, an ally, would use their experience as heads of local governments when they take on national leadership roles.Gatchalian is planning to run for senator under Binay’s United Nationalist Alliance coalition.“In the coming elections, the one that should lead us should have competence, experience and concern for the country,” he said.The longest serving Makati mayor spoke of his more than two decades’ experience as a local chief executive and his programs that provided many benefits to senior citizens.In an earlier speech at the Coconut Palace, Binay called the Aquino administration “insensitive” and “bumbling,” bringing up such issues as the Metro Rail Transit breakdowns and the Disbursement Acceleration Program.Mon Ilagan, UNA spokesperson, said the Vice President had raised valid points, as indicated by the President’s directive to his Cabinet to respond to Binay’s criticism point by point.“Perhaps it reminded President Aquino that it seems there was a basis for the statements of the Vice President about the problems of the country,” Ilagan said in an interview.Another Binay spokesperson took the administration to task for harping on the Vice President’s use of the Coconut Palace, instead of responding to the “substantive issues” he raised.Joey Salgado, OVP media affairs head, said Binay was grateful for being allowed the use of the Coconut Palace, but Malacañang seemed to be rubbing the favor in Binay’s face.“It seems the Palace is now doing an accounting of the supposed favors extended by the President to the Vice President, treating public funds as personal monies given to officials and agencies who are expected to be eternally grateful,” he said.

"To postpone scheduled barangay (village) elections for the first time may be tolerable, postponing it the second time may be bearable but to postpone it again for the third time is already untenable and so unreasonable, an election lawyer said on Wednesday.In a statement, Romulo Macalintal cited Sen. Ralph Recto who, according to him, said the village elections being canceled for the third time is already a “strike three against democracy.”“Thus, the proposal of certain legislators to cancel the twice postponed barangay elections set on May 14, 2018 is already too much of an imposition upon [village] officials who do not enjoy our present mandate. They were elected for a three-year term last October 2013 to serve from November 2013 to November 2016 with the elections set on October 31, 2016. But their term of office was extended in holdover capacities when the October 2016 barangay elections were postponed until October 2017 and the latter canceled again and, as stated, set on May 14, 2018,” Macalintal said.He added that the Constitution mandates that these village officials shall be elected by their respective constituents, meaning that they cannot be appointed.Hence, according to Macalintal, the repeated cancelation of the elections and the extension of the term of office of “holdover officers” are a violation of the Constitution because, as enunciated by Supreme Court Justice Presbitero Velasco in his separate opinion in the 2011 case of Kida vs Senate, “Legislative appointment covers ‘holdover offices’ since a legislative extension of the term of an incumbent is virtually an appointment of the office for the extended time.”He also cited then Associate Justice and later Chief Justice Artemio Panganiban, saying in the 1997 case of David vs Comelec where certain incumbent barangay officials wanted to cancel the 1997 village polls, the Supreme Court held that “the petition is a subtle and self-serving proposition to lengthen governance without a mandate from the governed. In a democracy, elected leaders can legally and morally justify their reign only by obtaining the voluntary consent of the electorate.”“Indeed, the dangerous effect of such a scheme is that if it can be done for barangay officials, what could prevent Congress from canceling the elections for other elective officials, like the President down to the last position of councilor, and extend their respective terms of office. This practice clearly violates the democratic system of our government where we could only be governed by leaders who have our free and voluntary mandate, not by those who were only imposed upon us by legislation, whether we like them,” Macalintal said.",1
"Mark Taguba, who linked Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte to smuggling, and eight others have been charged with drug trafficking by the National Bureau of Investigation over the seized P6.4 billion worth of illegal drugs from China.The smuggling of the illegal drug into the country has so far led to two separate legislative inquiries and the courtesy resignation of two senior officials of the Bureau of Customs (BOC).It also put the spotlight on the incessant unlawful transactions in the BOC, long regarded as one of the most corrupt state agencies.But not a single customs official was included in the criminal case, which was brought to the Department of Justice on Monday, nearly three months after the “shabu” was recovered from a warehouse in Valenzuela City.Besides Taguba, named respondents were businessman Kenneth Dong, warehouse owner Richard Chen, Taiwanese Chen Min and Jhu Ming Yun, Teejay Marcellana, Li Guang Feng, alias Manny Li, Eirene Mae Tatad and Fidel Anoche Dee.They were charged with violation of Section 4 of Republic Act No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, for the “importation of dangerous drugs and/or controlled precursors and essential chemicals.”A separate complaint for violation of Section 28 of Republic Act No. 9280, or the Customs Brokers Act of 2004, were also lodged against Taguba, Dong and Li for “unauthorized practice of customs broker profession.”“Subjects, through their indispensable cooperation, caused the importation of five wooden crates from China … Thus, in violation of Section 4 of RA 9165 … for importation of dangerous drugs,” read a portion of the NBI complaint.The NBI said the wooden boxes contained a total of 605 plastic bags filled with 603 kilograms of shabu, or cyrstal meth, with a street value of P6.4 billion.In addition to the official report on the confiscated shabu, the NBI attached the affidavits executed by a number of witnesses, who testified in the congressional hearings, as evidence against the accused.",1

Basta Pilipino ka, obligado ang gobyerno na bigyan ng benepisyo na pangkalusugan (This is a huge comfort for every Filipino, especially the poor. As long as you are Filipino, the government is obligated to provide health benefits),” he said in a radio interview.“Hindi magiging isyu ang kapasidad ninyo magbayad – importante lang ay ipinanganak kang Pilipino (Your capacity to pay will not be an issue – the only important thing is you are born Filipino),” the Palace official added.President Rodrigo Duterte, in his State of the Nation Address on Monday, urged the speedy passage of the bill, saying there is much room for improvement in the country’s healthcare system.“To this end, I urge the speedy passage of the Universal Health Care Bill authored by former Representative Harry Roque,” Duterte said.The President said the Philippine health care system has remained “highly fragmented,” leading to a “disparity” in health outcomes across social classes and geographical classifications.He also noted how “several policies and operational bottlenecks” have constrained universal healthcare.“We shall pool all our resources for health services under the [PhilHealth]; institutionalize primary care as a prerequisite to access higher level of healthcare; and supplement human resource gaps of the LGUs (local government units) through a National Health Workforce Support System,” Duterte said.He added that his administration aimed to “ensure that every Filipino gets the appropriate affordable and quality health services in appropriate facilities,” and that citizens will also be “protected from financial burden due to sickness.”Duterte, through Roque, had earlier marked as urgent the passage of the proposed bill.Under the House version of the Universal Healthcare Bill, all Filipinos will be covered by a national health insurance. PhilHealth will be changed into Philippine Health Security Corporation, which would pay for medical fees and products.A counterpart measure is pending at the Senate.",1

"President Rodrigo Duterte has not yet even completed a full 14 months of his six-year term but already, political parties are floating the names of their standard bearers come 2022.Vice President Leni Robredo, being the highest-ranking member of the opposition Liberal Party is almost assured of nomination to run for president.The Duterte administration has also started floating the name of Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, the president’s daughter, to be the ruling PDP-Laban’s candidate.Not to be outdone, the minority coalition that includes Akbayan is reportedly grooming Senator Risa Hontiveros to be their chosen one.The women’s organization Gabriela couldn’t be more pleased with this frontrunner line-up, telling The Adobo Chronicles that an all-women candidate field will totally eliminate issues of machismo and misogyny from the presidential race.Gabriela has already chosen its 2022 election meme which is: “May the best woman win.”Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all ?",0
"Malacañang on Monday slammed The New York Times (NYT) for doing a demolition job on President Duterte.In just one week, according to presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella, the Times published a psychological profile of Mr. Duterte tracing his rise to power through violence, an editorial demanding accountability for the thousands of extrajudicial killings in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, and released a video documentary showing the bodies of the victims of the antinarcotics crackdown and their grief-stricken families.Abella was referring to the article “Becoming Duterte: The Making of a Philippine Strongman,” published on Thursday; the editorial “Accountability for Duterte,” published on Saturday, and the video documentary “When a President Says, ‘I’ll Kill You,’” released on Monday.“NYT’s very obvious demolition work flies in the face of the very high approval the President enjoys,” Abella said.Stirring global outrageThe Times, he said, “tries to stir global outrage in a nation that welcomes its newfound peace and order.”Some groups have estimated that more than 8,000 people, mostly poor, small-time drug users, have been killed since Mr. Duterte launched his war on drugs after taking office in June last year.The Times editorial blames the killings on “the police and vigilantes” and says Mr. Duterte “relishes his image as a defiant crusader, willing to encourage the slaughter of thousands in the name of saving his nation from the scourge of drugs.”“The man is impervious to moral criticism, but he may not be immune forever from legal action,” the Times said, citing an impeachment complaint filed in the House of Representatives by Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano and the plan by Josue Sabio, a lawyer for two confessed hit men who said they belonged to a liquidation squad operated by Mr. Duterte when he was mayor of Davao City, to bring a case against the President in the International Criminal Court in The Hague.Free De LimaThe editorial also cited the persecution of the highest-profile critic of Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, Sen. Leila de Lima, who was arrested last month on “spurious charges that she took bribes from drug traffickers.”The Times called for the immediate release of De Lima and the dropping of all politically motivated charges against her.“A more consequential action could be one threatened by the European Union (EU),” the Times said. “Outraged by Mr. Duterte’s behavior, as well as his government’s possible reinstatement of the death penalty and lowering the age of criminal prosecution to 9, the EU has proposed hitting his government where it may hurt the most—by imposing tariffs on Philippine goods. Other democratic trading partners should do the same.”‘Well-funded campaign’Abella blamed the Times series on “certain personalities and politicians” who he believed had mounted a “well-funded campaign” using “hack[s] and their ilk” in a bid to oust Mr. Duterte.“However, the administration will not be deterred in fulfilling its promise of building a progressive and inclusive nation free from drugs, crime and corruption,” he said.",1

As of 11 a.m. of June 24, the video has gathered 40,000 views and 492 shares.“I hope we can collect as many bags of blood as we can,” Guico said.The bloodletting activity, part of this town’s celebration of June as World Blood Donors’ Month, will be held at the town’s Rock Garden starting 8 in the morning on June 28.The “viral vampires” might again make an appearance, Guico said, so as not to disappoint people who may be expecting the bloodthirsty cast at the blood drive.",1

"Former Light Rail Transit Authority administrator Melquiades Robles posted on Friday a P30,000 bail on his graft case for allegedly allowing a contractor to shortchange the train system of janitorial services in 2009.This came after the Sandiganbayan Fifth Division found probable cause to order Robles’s arrest earlier this week.“The court finds that sufficient grounds exist for the finding of probable cause for the purpose of issuing warrant of arrest in this case,” read the resolution by the court’s Fifth Division.The court had also issued a hold departure order against Robles, 10 LRTA procurement officials, and two private individuals facing one count of violating Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act over the alleged irregularity in the implementation of the janitorial services contract.Under the maintenance contract with the joint venture of COMM Builders and Technology Philippines Corp., PMP Inc., and Gradski Saobracaj GRAS, LRTA procured the services of 321 janitors at a cost of P3.37 million a month.But the LRTA officials and the joint venture allegedly conspired to reduce the number of deployed janitors to 219, effectively modifying the terms of the contract.The discrepancy allegedly resulted in injury to the government, to the tune of P1.07 million monthly or P12.86 million for the year 2009 alone, according to the charge sheet.",1
"PASSENGERS flying out of the country must be at airports four hours early as part of expected beefed-up security measures, including stricter immigration protocols.The Bureau of Immigration (BI) issued the reminder following President Duterte’s declaration of a state of emergency after the bomb attack in Davao City on Sept. 2 that left 14 dead and wounded more than 60.“Expect stricter and longer immigration protocols in view of the state of lawlessness. This mandates all agencies in the customs, immigration and quarantine services to tighten security,” said Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente.International passengers should be at the airport early to allow for security baggage checks, check in at airlines and immigration inspection, he said.Morente said travelers should be cleared for departure at the immigration counter at least 45 minutes before the flight.It takes 45 seconds usually for an immigration officer to process a departing passenger, as long as the passenger fulfills BI requirements on departure and boarding formalities.“The processing time could take longer if the immigration officer deems it necessary to refer a passenger for secondary examination by the BI’s travel control and enforcement unit (TCEU) at the airport,” he said.The TCEU is primarily responsible for checking if passengers referred for secondary examination are possible victims of human trafficking or illegal recruitment scams. It may decide to defer departure, pending the passenger’s compliance with BI requirements, Morente said.In recent days since the Davao City blast, roads leading to Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) have been jammed because of security checkpoints inspecting vehicles entering Naia premises.This prompted airport and airline officials to advise passengers on domestic and international flights to arrive earlier at the airport.",1

"MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau)- How many more lives must be sacrificed before the people would act and put an end to violence in the society? This was the message of Senator Leila de Lima on the observace of Dr. Jose Rizal day today in the Philippines.

It was actually a quote from Rizal’s famous book, “Noli Me Tangere:” (Touch Me Not).“Just like Rizal was persecuted for his defiance of the abuses of the Spanish colonizers, I am being persecuted for my lone defiance of the abuses of the Duterte administration. I have been called names, accused of all sorts of things, tried in public and threatened with imprisonment, and I suspect even death,” the senator said.“And just like Rizal, I will not be touched and if I die, I will die a hero. I have even been given an award in the United States for standing up to Duterte. That must mean something as far as heroism is concerned.”",0

"1: Metro Manila Taxi Drivers vs UP Diliman Professors2: What Marcos Era are we talking about?They were obviously too sleepy back then to have noticed images like this.“Life today has not changed compared to 1985.”“Is the post-Martial law, mostly Cojuangco-led Philippines better for the regular apolitical citizen?”3: Understanding “The Question”1. Physiological, or the need for basic survival, i.e. Health2. Safety, the need to feel secure3. Love, the need for belongingness4. Esteem, or the need for respect from others5. Self-actualization, or the need to be the best that one can be6. Self-transcendence [Maslow 1991], or the need for a higher goal, e.g. altruism (helping others) or spirituality.Discontent4: Defining the Regular Pinoy’s (Dis)contentmentIs today’s regular Filipino more discontented than a regular Filipino in 1985?Quantifying (Dis)contentSIDE NOTE: The Gini indices for 2000, 2009, and 2012, which are 46.17, 42.91, and 43.04, respectively. This implies that the much-demonized Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo managed to improve income distribution during her reign. Meanwhile Benigno Aquino managed to somehow worsen income distribution, albeit by a relatively negligible degree (0.13 from 2009 to 2012). Gini index data for 2015 is not yet available.Demystifying the Bongbong Marcos PhenomenonBlue and Orange are but shades of Yellow.“I totally disagree with what you say, but I do understand where you’re coming from.” (ThinkingPinoy)I love chatting with taxi drivers, whom I sometimes get into friendly arguments with, especially when they turn out to be Bongbong Marcos supporters. Their narratives are pretty much the same: life was better during the 70s and 80s. This is confusing for me, because I was taught that the Martial Law era was hell on earth.The stories they tell me are in total contrast with what I have learned in the history books. Having attended UP Diliman, I was taught that Martial Law was about human rights abuses and hordes upon hordes of Marcos cronies. Heck, some of my professors were political prisoners back then, while those that managed to evade arrest seemingly had to tone down their work or thoroughly wrap them with metaphors, such as my funny, loveable and uber-intellectual Humanities professor, Domingo Landicho, who wrote “ Bulaklak ng Maynila ”.I despised the Martial Law regime my entire life, and that holds true up to now. This is the same reason why I never supported Grace Poe, whose campaign was supported largely by Danding Cojuangco, a Marcos crony [ TP: Grace Poe ]. Picture this: if ThinkingPinoy were started in November 1975 instead of November 2015, TP’s blog would have lasted a week at best. Back then, popular magazines were mostly about aristocratic weddings in five-star hotels [ Inquirer ], while incendiary politically-charged literature were best kept unpublished [ Manila Times ].However, unlike many people I know, I am not into intellectual snobbery. I don’t even consider myself to be an intellectual anyway: I would like to believe that I just happen to bea pedestrian with lots of common sense and a decent internet connection. Hence, I thought long and hard about the reason behind the proliferation of the Martial-Law-Days-were-better story, about the reason behind the chasm that separates my teachers’ version of the story, and the taxi drivers’.After all, at least a hundred of my Facebook friends are wondering the same thing.Here’s the typical profile the typical taxi driver I meet:. As to why I know that, let me tell you that Metro Manila traffic is so bad you’ll be privy to a taxi driver’s innermost secrets by the time you arrive at your destination.With this profile, I can infer a few things about the typical taxi driver:, he was about 10 to 20 years old when EDSA 1986 happened, given his age. Thus, he never really experienced Martial Law as an adult, as Martial Law was from 1972 to 1981. More likely than not, he was referring to the post-Ninoy assassination years (1983-1986) of the Marcos regime, preceding the First EDSA People Power Revolution [ Gov ]., he earns just enough to make ends meet, given his salary and his college-age kid. He never experienced affluence on a level that allowed him to venture into intense mental labor. He is generally discontented with his life. He feels he deserves more., he has not read a lot about martial law, except for a week or two’s worth of history lessons, because high school history classes are generally boring. Moreso for public schools, where teacher-to-student and book-per-student ratios are abysmal, to say the least.With these said, I think it’s reasonable to conclude that he was not referring to the bloody late 70’s martial law, but the generally quality of life of the masses in the early to mid-1980s.That is, when a taxi driver says “Life was better during Marcos’ time”, he unconsciously means:That is, the taxi driver is saying:After all, what does he care about the writ of habeas corpus when all he wants is food to feed his family and a roof over his and his kids’ heads?Let’s make sure that we are on the same page here. After all, the question mentioned above is tricky to answer, mainly because the standards that make life good is different for the intelligentsia and for mass society To give some perspective, let’s take a quick look at the hierarchy of needs [ Maslow 1943 ] ranked in order of decreasing urgency:This list was eventually expanded to include:Marcos-era political prisoners and their sympathizers comprise the bulk of those who are perplexed with the Bongbong Marcos phenomenon, and this group includes me, ThinkingPinoy. So, with respect to the list above, what exactly am I looking for whenever I urge someone to hate the Marcoses?I think I have gotten past needs one to four and to some extent, have fulfilled the fifth. That is, after reasonably fulfilling needs one to five, I am now on the quest for self-transcendence, that’s why I have risked life and limb through the stuff I publish in this goddamned website, like the time I wrote about that Magdalo hacker [ TP: Trillanes' Hacker ].I have reason to believe that Marcos-era political prisoners and their sympathizers share the same situation. After all, they fight “ignorance” about Marcos Era abuses because they don’t want this country to suffer the same fate again, and that, to some extent, is altruism. But does this conclusion apply to taxi drivers, i.e. the masses? No.With the typical taxi driver as an example plus the three inferences that I made in the previous section, it is reasonable to further conclude that the masses, the same “Dutertards” that Carlos Celdran demonizes, are still struggling to fulfill the first five needs. Hence, we can’t expect mass society to even bother with self-actualization and self-transcendence. They will not bother to read books because they have tummies to fill and criminals to look out for.Most particularly, masses are more concerned about self-actualization than self-transcendence. They want to be the best they can be. Or more specifically, they want to feel that they are given the same opportunities as anybody else.What happens when that doesn't happen?“The Question” can now be restated as:Contentment is a relative term. For example, no 1995 teenager will complain about not having a cellphone. Meanwhile in 2015, even pre-pubescent children raid the Google Play Store for the latest android games.In short, the regular Filipino’s standards for contentment change over time, and it is based on what he sees around him. If he sees more people can buy phones, he wants to be able to buy a phone too. If he sees more people buying cars, he wants to be able to do the same. A college education, an overseas vacation, a house and lot, the list goes on. That is, at any given point, a regular Filipino expects to be able to do the same things his neighbor does.But how is discontent minimized?After all, if every Juan shares the same income level, then any given Juan will be able to buy the same things bought by the Juan next door.Yes, GDP has risen by leaps and bounds since 1985. Our leaders tell us we should be happy because GDP grows. In particular, the Aquino administration use GDP to justify it claims about the Philippines' economic success [ TP: GMA vs PNoy ]. From Php 2 trillion in 1985, GDP rose by over 250% to Php 7 trillion in 2014.However, is the regular Filipino 250% more contented after 30 years?GDP growth as a measure of improvement works only if there’s equitable distribution of wealth,However, it appears that since 1985, and even in the past 10 years, this newly-created wealth did not significantly trickle down at all, that income distribution has remained pretty much the same as, if not worse than, 1985 levels.Thus, I believe that a more accurate measure of mass discontentment is the GINI index.The Gini index measures equality of income distribution on a scale of 0 to 100. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality [ World Bank ]. Thus, for a regular Filipino, decreases in Gini index is preferable. (Now, let’s take a look at the table below [ World Bank ]:Looking at the table above, we can see that income inequality has actually increased by two points from 1985 to 2012. That is, mass discontent is higher in 2012 than in 1985. In particular, we can see the that richest 10% in 2016 hold a larger share of the country’s wealth than their 1985 counterparts, while the poorest 10% hold a smaller share of the country’s wealth than their 1985 counterparts.Yes, the reader may argue that the changes could be marginal, i.e. insignificant. With that taken into account, I can say that things have changed little, and whatever little change there was, it’s for the worse.To give a better perspective, income inequality in the US has gotten so bad that it gave birth to the Occupy Wall Street Movement [ Occupy ], where regular Americans are disgusted by the fact that 20% of the nation’s wealth is owned by only 1% of the population [ Politifact ].Now, with a GINI index that’s worse than the USA’s, just imagine how much of Philippine GDP our top 1% owns.Corazon Cojuangco Aquino led the country after the First EDSA Revolution. She was followed by Ramos, her anointed successor [ Skard 2015 ]. Ramos was replaced by Estrada, with blessings from Danding Cojuangco [ TP:Poe-Danding ]. After that came Cojuangco-less Arroyo, but was soon replaced by another Cojuangco: Benigno Simeon.In a post-Martial law, mostly Cojuangco-led Philippines, the regular Filipino remains to be as discontented as he was thirty years ago. From the point of view of a taxi driver, nothing really changed.But the manong taxi driver is just like every regular Filipino: he wants a better life. Yes, the manong taxi driver may be unaware of the “real story” behind Martial Law, but PNoy and his relatives have made it clear that their antithesis, the exact opposite of Yellow leadership, is the Marcos Era.Therein lies the fundamental problem: the taxi driver is sick of the status quo because it has been the status quo for as long as he can remember. He’s so desperate that he’s willing to exchange it for anything else, even if he does not fully understand what he wishes.This is the same reason why there has been a resurgence of Marcos apologists even before the election season began. The regular Filipino is so desperate for change that he will choose anything as long it’s not a Cojuangco, and it just so happens that the Cojuangco-Aquinos successfully painted the Marcoses as their polar opposites.The masses associate stagnation with the Cojuangco family, so the masses are likely to associate change with , whether good or bad, the antithetic Marcos family. Add the fact that Bongbong Marcos is a spitting image of his father makes the contrast even starker.Then, with this decision, the masses look for more ways to justify and reinforce their decisions via cognitive bias [ Wilke 2012 ].And that’s why they glorify that “Martial Law Thingy.”I can’t blame people for not doing something that they know nothing about. So for those Manong taxi drivers, TP says:I still dislike Bongbong Marcos, but I am not hating his supporters.Did you like this post? Help ThinkingPinoy stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help!",0

"The government does not have a law to use as basis in enforcing limits on the number of people entering Boracay, environment and local officials admitted on Wednesday.Aklan Gov.

"When Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle visited Pope Francis’ office at the Vatican last September, he bought with him a suitcase carrying a very special gift—the hope of 1,000 Filipino children who had been living on the streets of Manila.Empowered by pen, paper and their imagination, the children, ages 3 to 22, now under the care of a nongovernment organization, Tulay ng Kabataan (TNK), had each written a special letter asking Pope Francis to come visit them during his trip to the Philippines.Each drawing and message had different forms but were united in spirit and in dream.Jose, 11, says, “My drawing is that of a little boy praying because praying is important to us and what we do every day. It is God who we are talking to and through this we hope our wishes will come true.”“Such a simple and touching message, showing how a wounded child, does not give up and puts his hope in the hands of God,” says Fr. Matthieu Dauchez, a French executive director of TNK.Alexandra Chapeleau, communications and partnership manager at TNK, says the Pope’s visit to the children will help them know they are not alone. “They will feel the mercy of God through Pope Francis, and will understand that despite their terrible stories, the world is not ignoring them.”How campaign startedThe campaign, called Even Us, started when a French volunteer at ANAK TNK, the French sponsor of TNK Manila, wrote the Pope and asked him to visit the children. TNK, which helps children transition from a life on the streets to a safe home, then decided the children should ask him themselves.What began as a two-monthlong letter writing campaign at the shelters, was then complemented by a video promoting the children’s dream.The powerful video, which shows realities of their life on the streets and the joy in their smiles as they translated their hope into words, has already received almost 10,000 views. Though the Pope has yet to confirm a visit to the children, he has acknowledged receipt of the letters.Neil Mercado, a teacher in charge of the Pope-related children’s activities, says, “The children remain very excited. They ask every day if he is coming.”Dauchez explains, “We know Pope Francis is coming to Manila and we are aware of his great love for the poorest among the poor. So we thought that letters coming from wounded, neglected and abused children, who still believe in this hope that he proclaims on the rooftops of the world … could be a great message and gift for our children.”Thousands of children live on the streets without any links to their families—surviving by begging, stealing and prostituting themselves.

"How can some Filipinos profess to be Catholics and at the same time approve of extrajudicial killings (EJKs) in President Duterte’s war on drugs?For Cotabato Archbishop Orlando Cardinal Quevedo, the answer is a dichotomy in some Filipinos’ faith.“Despite the teaching of the Church, we are a country where our faith is a dichotomy. We believe in it, but we do not practice our faith,” Quevedo told a press briefing in Manila on Tuesday.Quevedo was one of the speakers on the second day of the fourth World Apostolic Congress on Mercy.His comments referred to the observation that some Catholics have expressed approval of Mr. Duterte’s brutal campaign against illegal drugs.More than 6,000 people have been killed by police and unknown assailants since Mr. Duterte launched the campaign after taking office on June 30 last year.Human rights violationsLingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas, too, has criticized the human rights violations in the campaign, though not in his capacityas president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines.Quevedo said he admired Mr. Duterte’s determination to end the drug menace, but observed that many Filipinos seemed to approve of the extrajudicial killings, as indicated by the President’s +85 percent rating in the fourth quarter 2016 survey of the Social Weather Stations.Many Filipinos must be desperate for solutions to the country’s problems, he said.“Corruption is in government offices, but there are 80 percent of Catholics in the government. If there’s corruption and murder, it’s because Filipinos do not practice their faith,” Quevedo said.He added: “This dichotomy is a split-level type of Christianity. Our faith is in one level and the other level is daily life, they do not jibe.”He warned that approval of the extrajudicial killings is “a symptom of split-level spirituality.”Explaining split-level Christianity, Quevedo quoted a priest as saying that “we are saints on Sundays, but devils the rest of the week.”",1
"Philippine National Police spokesperson Senior Supt. Benigno Durana has owned up to the mistake of tagging Naga City, the hometown of opposition figurehead and Vice President Leni Robredo, as the fifth top crime-prone city in the country.In a press conference last week to clarify some perceived misquotes in news reports that day, PNP Director General Oscar Albayalde said Naga City was “consistent” as having the fifth highest crime volume and fifth highest number of index crimes for 2017 and 2018.After the documents Albayalde had cited were released to the media, however, it soon became apparent the PNP chief had mistaken the region number for the ranking. The list of 36 highly urbanized and independent component cities had been arranged by region.Naga City is in Bicol, Region 5.Wrongly listedThis was why when Albayalde was asked to name the five cities with the highest crime rate, he had enumerated them consecutively by region—Region 2’s Santiago City, Isabela; Region 3’s Angeles City in Pampanga and Olongapo City in Zambales; Region 4-B’s Puerto Princesa City in Palawan; and Region 5’s Naga City.It was Durana who gave Albayalde the document that the PNP chief read out.President Duterte had claimed Naga was a “hotbed” of “shabu” (crystal meth). Since the PNP was still collating the drug data for the cities, Albayalde sought to back the President’s claim through the crime data.“If the assumption is that crime and drugs are interrelated, we can rightfully make our own conclusion,” the PNP chief said.In posts on her official Twitter account, Robredo—one of many officials who had already been decrying the “shabu hotbed” tag on Naga—called the PNP’s mistake “totally unacceptable.”“Spare our people and our beloved city from misinformation,” Robredo said.On Friday, Durana apologized for Albayalde’s mix-up.“My sincere apology [for] this oversight and whatever inconvenience it may have caused in which I, as [PNP’s] acting chief [public information officer], [am] solely responsible,” he said.However, he said that among 36 cities, Naga City “posted the highest average monthly crime rate” from January to July 2018, followed by Mandaue City, Iloilo City, Santiago City and Cebu City.Accurate assessmentNaga City’s monthly crime rate for the first half of the year was 202.80. Crime rate refers to the number of crime victims per 100,000 people in a given locality.“It will validate [the President’s statement] even more because crime rate is a more accurate assessment of a crime situation of a given locality,” Durana said.Durana also insisted that if Metro Manila cities were not considered on the list, Naga City would rank sixth in total crime volume and second in index crime volume for the first half of the year.If Metro Manila cities were included in the ranking, however, Naga, with a crime volume of 2,879, would rank only 16th out of 36 cities. The top three cities with the highest crime volume were Quezon City with 22,019 followed by Manila with 12,424 and Cebu City with 6,324.Naga comes right after the President’s hometown, Davao City, which ranked 15th with a total crime volume of 3,071.",1
"Let's face it; life would be boring without those who oppose our views. The challenge to all who rabidly try to prove they make more sense than the other party is to discuss their views rationally without resorting to character assassination. The question now is: are Filipinos ready for this kind of set-up? There is enough evidence to suggest that most of them are not.If you want to get a chance to be heard, you need to give others a chance to have his or her say as well. Whatever your beliefs are, simply putting yourself in the other person's shoes would help you understand that listening and giving importance to others is the best defense.A lot of people have this misguided notion that we should be free to do or say whatever we want. But with freedom comes great responsibility. There is a price to pay when we do things without caring for the consequences of our actions. We may not realize it instantly but sometime in the future we will find ourselves in the same situation that others were in while we made fun of them or acted indifferently towards them. Just remember that ""for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"".Life is a game and there are certain rules we must follow in order to live in harmony with our surroundings. We all need to abide by a certain guideline or a code wherever we go whether it is written or unwritten – in school, our office and public places. Sadly, in Philippine society, most Filipinos do not follow anything whether it is written or not. Instead, each Filipino lives by his or her own set of rules and the results speak for itself.In a mature society, members of the community do not need to be reminded of the rules all the time. They use their common sense, which is not something that most Filipinos have.",0

"The news that a Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) combatant during the Mamasapano massacre has become a government witness is deeply unsettling, both to the government and the secessionist group.The worst implication of the guerrilla-turned-government-witness naming the MILF rebels involved in the Mamasapano massacre would be that it would trigger fighting within the MILF itself, the source said.“We are verifying this,” MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal said in a phone interview on Saturday.Iqbal declined to elaborate, saying only that the MILF was “looking at this through the peace process.”Two government officials privy to the peace process said that an MILF guerrilla claiming to have been a participant in the Jan. 25 bloodbath in which 44 SAF commandos were brutally killed had run to the government for protection had serious implications.The two officials said they were caught by surprise by the news, which they read in the Inquirer on Saturday.The Inquirer report said that Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, with justice department prosecutors and National Bureau of Investigation investigators, had interviewed the MILF combatant in an undisclosed place in Mindanao, and that the latter had given a statement in which he named the MILF fighters who participated in the massacre.Needs validationThe report also said that the MILF-combatant-turned-government-witness had decided to talk to the government because he feared for his life and those of his family.“Those familiar with the inner workings of the MILF know that the fighters don’t act this way. So this is quite different,” said one of the officials who asked not to be identified.The identity, background and motives of the MILF guerrilla should be “really validated,” said the second official.“What he said he would do, naming the MILF fighters involved in Mamasapano, will have great implications. I hope there is a good way of validating him,” the second source said.For both Inquirer sources, there is more than meets the eye in an MILF fighter running to the government for protection.He could be a disgruntled fighter, a government asset, a follower of an MILF official who had been expelled from the group, or even an asset of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, a breakaway group of the MILF.The two officials said they did not know the identity of the MILF fighter and were basing their comments on the Inquirer story.There are at least eight groups investigating the Mamasapano incident that left 67 people dead: 44 Philippine National Police-SAF commandos; 18 MILF guerrillas; and 5 civilians, including an 8-year-old girl.No need to consolidateAside from the NBI, those investigating the incident are the PNP board of inquiry (BOI), the Senate, the Commission on Human Rights, an MILF’s special investigating body, the International Monitoring Team and the House of Representatives.But even with several investigating bodies looking into the incident, Malacañang said it did not see the need to have a consolidated government report on Mamasapano.“At this point, I don’t think the President has expressed any preference but he is expecting first and foremost the report of the BOI. We know for a fact that Secretary Leila de Lima is likewise conducting her own investigation led by the DOJ (Department of Justice) and the NBI, and at this point, we do not see at least a need to consolidate,” deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said on Saturday over the state-run Radyo ng Bayan.Valte said it made no difference if the reports of the different government agencies would be consolidated or not.“What’s important are their findings,” she said.Valte said it was unlikely that the results of the different investigations would result in confusion rather than finding out the truth.“The reports will be made available to one another,” she said, referring to the different investigating bodies.RELATED STORIESNBI talks to MILF fighter turned gov’t witnessNephew of MILF unit leader recalls how clash with SAF men erupted",1
"Malacañang insisted on President Rodrigo Duterte’s unprecedented order that all investigations of security troops involved in his antidrug campaign or martial law operations be cleared with him.Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said such probes should be cleared with the President because, as commander in chief, Mr. Duterte assumes responsibility for the actions of government troops.But Abella also softened the demand by saying Mr. Duterte was making the “request” with due respect to the constitutional mandate of Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales.“The President requests that investigations of members of the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines related to the performance of their duties in the government’s antidrug campaign or while Mindanao is under martial law be addressed to him,” Abella said in a statement.“He assumes command responsibility for the actions of his men as Commander in Chief or Chief Executive,” he added.Constitutional mandateMorales, a retired Supreme Court justice, had already rejected the demand Mr. Duterte announced in a press conference after delivering his State of the Nation Address on July 24.“What business is it of his?” Morales told journalists on Friday, explaining that her constitutional office was empowered to investigate government officials and employees without the approval of the Chief Executive.“Under the law, we have subpoena powers. We have orders for particular officials, including police and soldiers, to show up or to file pleadings,” Morales said.“If they don’t file pleadings, that’s their lookout. To say they need prior approval of the President, that’s the lookout of those to whom he is addressing that,” she added.Morales said her office would follow the normal procedure and it would be up to the government employee or official if he listens to Mr. Duterte.The Office of the Ombudsman was created by the 1987 Constitution and, as a constitutional agency, its head can only be removed through impeachment.Moreover, investigations and trials can take several years, even beyond the six year term of a President. The retirement and other employment benefits of a government employee are not released during the pendency of a criminal case.Aside from making the demand, Mr. Duterte also threatened to abolish the Office of the Ombudsman and another constitutional office, the Commission on Human Rights.He said the Ombudsman should refrain from citing them in contempt because he has the final say whether they will attend the probe or not.In an interview with a Japanese news agency, Morales criticized Mr. Duterte’s public pronouncements.",1

"THE implementation of the second phase of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (Train) law might result in “minimal” job losses, an official of the Department of Finance (DoF) said on Wednesday.Finance Undersecretary Karl Chua said some sectors might be hit by job losses once the comprehensive tax reform, also known as Tax Reform for Attracting Better and Higher Quality Opportunities (Trabaho) bill, takes effect. However, he said Congress would allot a P500-million “adjustment fund” per year for five years for cash grants to workers laid off.“For us, if there is a job loss, [it will be] very minimal. What the Trabaho bill did was to allocate an adjustment fund to retool and provide cash grants to workers who may be affected,” Chua said.Chua said a P500-million budget would be allotted for skills upgrading.“Overall, even if there is job loss in one or two sectors, the overall economy, for me, has a positive job contribution. They will just transfer,” he said.Chua said overall job production would be better in the long run since about 97,000 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) would generate greater income because of lowered taxes.This, he said, would lead to the expansion of businesses, thus, generating more jobs.“For me, if there will be job losses, it will be temporary but the long-term effect is very positive,” Chua said.Finance Assistant Secretary Tony Lambino also on Wednesday said the Trabaho bill was job-positive, since 60 percent of Filipino workers are hired by micro small and medium enterprises.“Majority of Filipino workers [are covered,] so when we lower the tax rate for MSMEs, in this case, they will have more money to increase the productivity, so they can expand,” Lambino explained.“If they expand, they will hire even more workers so when we forecasted on balance, the Trabaho bill is jobs positive, which is why Congress called it Trabaho in the first place,” he added.Chua said the Finance department was confident that the measure would be passed by Congress.“They are also reviewing and evaluating the budget and that also means there’s also a need for this tax reform because how can they fund their budget if there is no tax reform and there is bigger loss?” he said.“Whether or not an election will happen, I think this is an important reform that many in Congress understand especially once you see the budget that needs to be funded well,” he added.",1

"At a time when costs of basic goods and services continue to rise, a labor group on Saturday said it found that the purchasing power of the daily minimum wage further eroded this week to P200.From P208.8 in June, the purchasing power of the average national minimum wage of P335 is now only worth P200, according to the moderate labor group Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP).Too smallALU-TUCP cited data from its monitoring of inflation’s impact on wages.The minimum wage’s purchasing equivalent was much less than the P1,400 budget which the National Economic and Development Authority said that a family of five needed daily to live decently.ALU-TUCP’s spokesperson, Alan Tanjusay, said the continuing decline of purchasing power was detrimental to workers and their families which could have a negative impact on productivity.Inflation 5-year high“What can workers buy for him and for his family with P200 a day?” Tanjusay said.“We can expect unhappy and less productive employees in the weeks ahead,” he added.In July, the country’s inflation rate recorded another five-year high of 5.7 percent.To help stem the impact of inflation, regional wage boards had ordered an adjustment in the minimum wage amounting to as high as P56.P750 a dayLabor groups, however, were dissatisfied as they pointed out that the increases were not enough to cover the high prices of basic goods and services.Instead, the labor groups supported calls for the immediate passage of a bill mandating a P750 daily minimum wage.Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III earlier said officials of the department were already studying the possibility of providing nonwage benefits to workers.He, however, did not elaborate on the proposal.On his proposed P200 monthly cash subsidy for workers, Bello said it has yet to be acted upon by the Office of the President.",1
"TO HELP the young generation understand the extent of the Marcos dictatorship’s excesses, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) recently unveiled a digital exhibit of jewelry from the Hawaii collection that could’ve otherwise provided for essential government projects such as school buildings.The initiative, dubbed “Virtual Jewelry Exhibit, A Story of Excesses: What Could Have Fueled A Nation’s Development,” aims to post regularly on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter images of select jewelry pieces from the Hawaii collection “to show and remind the present generation of the excesses and extravagance of the Marcoses in their two-decade dictatorship.”“The commission believes that it is its duty to remind Filipinos, especially the youth, of the real history. Through this online exhibit of the family’s collection of diamonds, gold, even tiaras, the PCGG hopes that the youth can visualize how the Marcoses abused the government coffers, part of history [that] is not in the history books,” the PCGG said in a recent statement.Among the featured pieces from the Hawaii jewelry collection are a brilliant baguette and oval-cut diamond coronet in white gold with comb, which the PCGG said could have financed the construction of eight one-story classrooms; a Belle Époque diamond tiara in platinum with French marks, which could have funded the treatment of more than 12,000 tuberculosis cases; and an 1880 antique Ceylon sapphire and diamond necklace mounted in silver and gold that could have provided power to more than 2,200 households in off-grid areas in the country.P1 billion worthWhile the PCGG did not indicate the individual price of the jewelry pieces, a recent appraisal by auction houses Christie’s and Sotheby’s valued at least P1 billion the three jewelry collections seized from the Marcoses and their associates in 1986, following the toppling of the dictatorship.The three jewelry collections kept at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas are the Hawaii, Malacañang and Roumeliotes collections.The Hawaii collection, composed of 300 pieces, was seized by the US customs bureau following the Marcoses’ arrival in Hawaii in 1986. The recent appraisal revealed that an“extremely rare” pink diamond, worth at least P235 million ($5 million), was in this collection.The Malacañang collection is composed of around 400 pieces of jewelry left behind by the dictator’s family as they fled the country, while the Roumeliotes collection was seized from Greek businessman Demetriou Roumeliotes, who attempted to smuggle out of the country a week after the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution at least 60 jewelry pieces, in violation of the Tariff and Customs Code.The PCGG said that apart from having a virtual exhibit of the jewelry pieces as part of its 30th anniversary activities, it will also mount a Good Governance Caravan in universities nationwide “to give the youth the opportunity to hear first-hand the dark stories of the martial law [era] and the excesses of the Marcos family and [their] cronies.”“It is [our] hope that the youth who are too young to have lived or endured the struggles during the dictatorship or those who have comfortably forgotten shall once again relive the fire that burned in the hearts of the Filipino people who marched on Edsa, who desperately but peacefully wanted change. So that young and old can say with knowledge or conviction, never again!” the PCGG said.The PCGG’s virtual exhibit can be viewed at www.facebook.com/TheNewPCGG and through Twitter @TheNewPCGG.",1

"The Aquino administration’s controversial Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) did not achieve its goal of fast-tracking public spending in the country’s premier university, state auditors found.The Commission on Audit (COA) found too slow the implementation of P1.2 billion worth of DAP-funded infrastructure projects on various campuses of the University of the Philippines (UP) in 2013.In its audit report for 2013 released on Wednesday, the COA reported that P1.2 billion was released to the UP System in September 2012 from the DAP through the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd).The funds were intended to finance 46 infrastructure projects. By the end of 2013, however, only a “minimal” 28 percent of the funds, or P362 million, had been used, the COA said.“The slow implementation resulted in unspent funds of P928.7 million, contrary to the DAP’s objective of fast-tracking expenditures to improve the country’s competitiveness,” the COA said.State auditors attributed the slow project implementation to “delayed/slow procurement process.”UP officials could not immediately give an update on the DAP projects listed in the COA report.The audit body recommended that UP review the projects, as the completion of some of them may have been compromised by the Supreme Court’s July 1, 2014, decision declaring the DAP unconstitutional.“We recommend that management evaluate the extent of implementation of the projects if [they] fall within the context of the Supreme Court decision, and fast-track the implementation of the projects already in the pipeline before the issuance of the Supreme Court decision,” the COA said.In that unanimous decision, the Supreme Court nullified the way President Aquino and Budget Secretary Florencio Abad funneled government “savings” to other projects outside the Congress-approved national budget.Malacañang defended the DAP as a stimulus package designed to speed up public spending and push economic growth.Of the P1.2 billion in DAP funds released by the CHEd to UP in September 2012, a third, or P431.9 million, went to the UP System Administration. Of that amount, only 33 percent had been spent by the end of 2013.The funds would go to three projects: faculty and staff housing (P197.9 million), eUP component 4 infrastructure development (P198 million), and renovation of the UP Quezon Hall administration building (P35.9 million).UP Diliman received the next largest share, P321.7 million (34 percent used); UP Cebu, P111.8 million (24 percent used); UP Manila, P95 million (3 percent used); UP Philippine General Hospital, P140.5 million to purchase MRI, CT scan and other urgently needed equipment (13 percent used).UP Los Baños received P78.2 million (15 percent utilized); UP Baguio, P41.5 million (86 percent used); UP Open University, P29.7 million (17 percent used); UP Mindanao, P25.7 million (22 percent used) and UP Visayas, P13.8 million (29 percent used).According to the COA, UP received P1.8 billion from the DAP from 2011 to 2013, including the windfall of P1.2 billion in 2012 from the CHEd.The rest of the DAP funds came from the Department of Budget and Management and the Department of Science and Technology.Unlike the P1.2 billion from the CHEd, the DAP funds coursed through the DOST amounting to P437.5 million was 89 percent used as of end 2013 for the UP-DOST Disaster Risk Exposure Assessment and Mitigation (Dream) project.The UP team in charge of the project explained the delay in their timetable to the delay of about nine months in acquiring the Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) equipment and the lease of aircraft services.Using Lidar technology, a team of UP geologists and engineers produced flood hazard maps of the country’s major river basins to enable local governments to issue flash flood and landslide warning once a forecast amount of rainfall has occurred.In the same report, the COA also ordered UP to return to the national treasury P155.2 million in unused money from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) to comply with the Nov. 19, 2013, Supreme Court decision on the pork barrel.The COA said that from 2000 to 2013, UP Diliman and UP Manila, UP Open University and UP-PGH received P1.56 billion in pork barrel funds from lawmakers.RELATED STORIESCOA notes irregularities in PGH pork4 accused of graft for bid to oust president of Manila university",1

"Opposition congressmen on Friday called for a congressional inquiry into allegations that greedy rice distributors were trying to create an artificial rice shortage to pump up the price of rice.The seven members of the Makabayan bloc filed House Resolution 1676 calling for an investigation into the crisis gripping the National Food Authority (NFA).An administration congressman, Quezon City’s Alfred Vargas, made his own appeal to traders and suppliers not to exploit the shortage of NFA rice in the market, and to maintain the prices of commercial rice.“If we can maintain the prices of commercial rice, then poor families can afford to buy while waiting for the supply of the NFA. This way we can still help the poor while doing business,” said Vargas, vice chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations.Depleting stocks of cheaper rice that the NFA sells are forcing consumers to buy commercial varieties whose prices, according to the Grains Retailers’ Confederation of the Philippines Inc. (Grecon), could surge to R5 a kilo.“Let’s trust our President here, who is known to be maka-masa. For the meantime traders should do their part too in helping the poor consumers. Old stocks should maintain the old price,” Vargas, a member of the ruling PDP-Laban party said.He said Duterte’s decision to allow NFA to import 250,000 metric tons to replenish the thinning buffer stock should not trigger panic.In HR 1676, the Makabayan group accused the NFA of “drumming up mass hysteria of rice shortage” to pressure the NFA Council into allowing importation of rice.HR 1676 was introduced by Ariel B. Casilao (Anakpawis Parytlist), Carlos Isagani Zarate (Bayan Muna), Emmi de Jesus and Antonio L. Tinio (ACT Teachers Partylist), Arlene Brosas and France Castro (Gabriela Partylist) and Sarah Jane Elago (Kabataan Partylist.)",1
"A group of farmers on Monday picketed in front of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) office in Quezon City to protest the appointment of former Armed Forces chief Ricardo Visaya as administrator of the agency.During Visaya’s term, he was the ground commander of the Northern Luzon Command in Central Luzon when many farmers were massacred in Hacienda Luisita, according to Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas Secretary General Milo Melegrito.“Most of our farmer leaders were killed during his [Visaya] tenure as ground commander,” Melegrito said in Filipino during an interview.He identified the farmer leaders as Jhon Gado, Perla Rodriguez, Tirzo Cruz, Ricardo Ramos, Federico de Leon, William Tadena, Bishop Alberto Ravento and Francisco Rivera.“Visaya is accountable for numerous killings of peasant leaders and activists in Central Luzon from 2005 to 2007,” he said.Melegrito added that Visaya was “trained under the notorious butcher” Gen. Jovito Palparan.“We are begging and urging President Rodrigo Duterte to please change his mind and find a more deserving official to head the irrigation agency,” he said.Earlier this month, then-NIA chief Peter Laviña resigned from his post amid corruption allegations.",1
"Blogger Mocha Uson became a columnist at the Philippine Star. Supporters of Mocha celebrated the achievement of the avid Duterte supporter, but someone tried to broke the celebration.Regina Belmonte, daugher of Star president Miguel Belmonte, expressed her disappointment on twitter and Facebook after she knew that Mocha Uson would became a columnist of Philippine Star.Regina believes that Mocha is peddling misinformation on social media and she doesn’t deserve to become a columnist in her father’s newspaper.She also complained to her father, Miguel Belmonte to convinced her dad to change their minds for accepting Mocha as their columnist in the Philstar.Mocha Uson quickly responded to the daughter of Philippine star and expressed her gratefulness for being considered to write and express the cry of the ordinary people in the newspaper.Even the famous Duterte supporters showed their support to Mocha Uson.Sass Rogando Sassot, responded to Regina’s tantrums and believes that Mocha deserved to be a writer for a newspaper because millions of people listens to her .Sass also lambasted Regina, saying that she may already fired in the Philippine Star if she’s not the newspaper President’s daughter because of her article’s poor perfomance.Professor Antonio Contreras also responded to Regina Belmonte.“Reprehensible human being.

"Teenagers and children would be kept off the streets during late hours under a nationwide curfew bill pending approval by the House of Representatives.The House committee on welfare of children approved last week a substitute bill mandating curfew for minors 18 years old and below to prevent them “from becoming vulnerable to the negative influences of street life.”Under the proposed “Unsafe Hours for Children Act,” the curfew would be in effect during “unsafe hours” and in “public places” from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.Many cities in the Philippines already impose curfews on minors, but the House bill would make it a national policy.Besides keeping the youth safe, the bill “intends to reduce the opportunities when children can be used as instruments of crime.”The bill would penalize parents, or legal guardians, who “knowingly or by insufficient control” allow their children to “loiter, roam, meander or sleep” in public places from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. “without lawful purpose or justifiable reason.”Fine of up to P1,000 or community service for five to 10 days, or both, shall be imposed on parents or guardians of children who violate the curfew for the third and succeeding offenses.",1
"Despite of the busy schedule, President Rodrigo Duterte gave his time to talk with the leaders and members of activists group BAYAN in Malacañang Palace on Tuesday.The delegation consisted of partylist representatives, farmers and workers and representatives from Mindanao.The meeting, according to the social media post of BAYAN secretary Renato Reyes Jr. became more serious than the last meeting between them and President Rodrigo Duterte because they talked about the extension of Martial Law in Mindanao until the end of the year which the activists extremely opposed.President Rodrigo Duterte meets the member of BAYANPhoto: Renato Reyes Jr.According to Reyes Jr. the President really wanted to extend Martial Law in Mindanao while the members of Bayan don’t want to extend it.Despite of their opposition to the Martial Law in Mindanao, they clarified to the President that they don’t support the ISIS affiliated Maute Terrorist Group that attacked Marawi City.They also talked about the militarization near the communities of Lumad, contractualization, free tuition in all State Universities and Colleges and land reform.President Rodrigo Duterte received the letter from the old and sick political prisoners that the members of BAYAN asked to be freed by the government because of their worsening conditions.Letters made by the political prisoners to President Duterte Photo: Renato Reyes Jr.They submitted the 20-point urgent demands from the group and informed the President about the mass rally that planned to organize in Mendiola on Monday, the same day which Duterte would deliver his second State of the Nation Address.Reyes Jr. expressed his disappointment to the result of their meeting, but thanked the President for the time that he gave for the meeting.“Nais sana naming maghatid ng mas magandang balita sa mga kasama na naghihintay sa Mendiola, pero hindi ito ang sitwasyon. Matingkad kanina ang mga pagkakaiba sa mga mayor na isyu.” Reyes said in his Facebook post.He said that it became more clearer that the activists must unite in Mendiola on Monday to voice out their message to the President.“Matapos ang pag-uusap, lalong luminaw ang pangangailangan ng sama-sama at militanteng pagkilos para maipanalo ang mga kagyat na makabayan at demokratikong interes ng masa, at makamit ang pagbabago. Alam natin kung kanino tayo dapat umasa. Lalong luminaw ang pangangailangan para sa malaking pagkilos sa darating na SONA sa July 24, at marinig ang panawagan ng mamamayang lumalaban.”The BAYAN secretary said that they determined to call for a democratic change and not for false promises by the government.Meanwhile, Presidential Communications assistant secretary Mocha Uson reported that President Rodrigo Duterte allowed the activists to rally against him on Monday.“Sige, mag-rally muna kayo, tapos mag-usap ulit tayo.” President Rodrigo Duterte told the members of BAYAN.Despite of being called a dictator by some people, President Rodrigo Duterte repeatedly showed that he’s open for criticisms and even allowed her critics to enter Malacañang Palace.On Monday President Rodrigo Duterte would deliver his second State of the Nation Address and showcase the achievement of the current administration in their first year.Reports said that 15,000 people would participate to the rally on President Duterte’s SONA.To maintain peace and order during the event, the Philippine National Police planned to deploy 6,300 police officers around Batasang Pambasa where President Duterte would deliver his SONA.PNP Director General chief Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa also ordered the organization that there would be no shields or batons, or firearms for police officers tasked to manage to protesters.The protesters were also allowed to do their program 15 to 20 meters near Batasang Pambansa.",0
"A rights advocacy group has brought to a UN office nearly 50 documented cases of political killings under the Duterte administration that took place despite the government’s peace negotiations with communist rebels.Karapatan Alliance for the Advancement of People’s Rights said it submitted on April 10 to Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the case files on 47 victims of extrajudicial killings in the government’s counterinsurgency campaign.The killings took place from July 1 last year when President Duterte assumed office to the end of March.The victims were peasants, indigenous peoples and workers who were killed by military or military agents for defending people’s rights, Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay wrote Callamard.“Under [the] Duterte [administration] from July 2016 to March 31, 2017, a total of 47 cases of extrajudicial killings were documented by Karapatan. We allege that state security forces are responsible for these killings that happened even when the Duterte [administration] has resumed the long-stalled formal peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) on Aug. 21, 2016, and the government declaration of unilateral ceasefire with the New People’s Army,” Palabay said.She noted that the political killings and other rights abuses escalated after Mr. Duterte lifted the government’s unilateral ceasefire and canceled the government-NDFP peace talks on Feb. 3, 2017.Shortly thereafter, the Armed Forces of the Philippines declared an all-out war against the NPA,” she added.Karapatan hopes its report is considered when the UN Human Rights Council conducts the third cycle of the universal periodic review of the human rights situation in the Philippines.During that process, the country’s human rights record over the past four years of the Aquino administration and the first months of the Duterte administration will be examined by other states.Palabay said that Karapatan was working with other groups in documenting cases of extrajudicial killings related to the antidrug campaign and that it would submit these cases to the United Nations.Karapatan said it had submitted documentation of 1,206 cases of political killings during the Arroyo administration and 334 such cases under the Aquino administration.“These killings are all in the context of the counterinsurgency programs implemented from one regime to another,” Palabay said.Karapatan asked the UN special rapporteur to investigate the cases and to recommend “appropriate actions,” such as underscoring the “gravity of political killings in the Philippines” to persuade the Duterte administration to prosecute the perpetrators and end its counterinsurgency program.The group said it had submitted the same case files to the government peace panel.Palabay said the group was also documenting cases of illegal arrests and illegal detention of civilians and activists, as well as forced evacuations and bombing of communities by the military.",1

"For decades now, Filipinos living in the United States have been lumped with the ‘Asian’ demographic subgroup by the Census Bureau. That is about to change starting with the 2020 population census.The bureau announced today that it has decided to reclassify Filipinos to ‘Pacific Islander,’ citing several significant reasons:The Philippines is an island nation that is not connected to the main Asian continent. The country sits in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, in close proximity to other Pacific Island nations like Fiji, Guam, and the countries of Polynesia. Its tropical weather is very similar to the rest of the Pacific Island nations. The Philippines uses the Latin alphabet (ABCDE) , unlike other Asian countries which use logographics like kanji, hanja and hangul (漢字). Most important of all, unlike their Asian counterparts in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam, the Filipinos do not use chopsticks. They use silverware or eat with their hands.Filipino communities in places like Daly City, Honolulu and Jersey City immediately praised the decision by the Census Bureau.So beginning in 2020, Filipinos will identify as P.I. — Pacific Islanders from the Philippine Islands (P.I.)",0
"A lawsuit was filed against Manny Pacquiao in the US District Court in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning for the Filipino boxer’s failure to disclose his shoulder injury before his fight with Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2.The potential class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of Staphane Vanel and Kami Rahbaran, both of Clark County, who are seeking as much as $5 million in damages.The plaintiffs said they relied on misrepresentations and non-disclosures when they bought their tickets or pay per view showings and wagered on the Mayweather-Pacquiao “fight of the century.”Also named in the lawsuit are Bob Arum of Top Rank Inc.; Michael Koncz, Pacquiao’s adviser; Todd Duboef; and other unknown defendants.Upon learning about the lawsuit, Mayweather reached out to Pacquiao in a gesture of the proverbial olive branch. Mayweather said that he will gladly pay the $5 Million in damages sought in the lawsuit if Pacquiao is convicted. “After all, that’s just a chunk of change for me,” the American boxer told reporters.Observers are now saying that all those ‘hugs’ by Mayweather during the May 2nd fight were done out of love for Pacquiao, like some sort of a bromance.Pacquiao himself, during an interview with a Filipino television network about those Mayweather hugs said, ‘Mahal niya yata ako’ (I think he loves me).",0
"Actually, I am curious as well. What did Ninoy actually do for the country? Take out his monologues and death (of which only an insane person will deny the country is divided about).For fairness, we’ll discount his suspicious absence in Plaza Miranda and his arguably treasonous Jabidah myth making. And let’s take out allegations of Japanese collaboration by his family, rumors of in-laws absconding with the Katipunan funds, and the fact that he was not a model student (kept transferring schools) and journalist (his editors say he was a terrible writer). So that’s quits.Ninoy was not the only political leader to be killed fighting Marcos: there were Edgar Jopson, Cesar Climaco, and Evelio Javier.For things built: the South and North Expressways, the C-5, and the present Manila International Airport were done during Marcos’s time, as well as our civil service and labor codes, all of which still benefit Filipinos today.Believe it or not, our military structure is still a remnant of Manuel Quezon’s creation.Senators have had lasting impacts: there’s the Recto and Maceda laws (on rent), the Lina Law (on squatters), and Pimentel’s (local government code).Lorenzo Tanada was a national team footballer that later prosecuted Japanese collaborators (which included Benigno Aquino Sr; as historical interest see gr. no. l-1243, April 1947) and also acted to have publication of laws implemented as part of due process.As opposition leaders, there were Gerry Roxas, Ben Diokno, Neptali Gonzales, Jovy Salonga, Aquilino Pimentel, Lorenzo Tanada, Doy Laurel, Ramon Mitra, Eva Kalaw, Tecla Ziga, Bono Adaza. Former Marcos guys Kit Tatad and Paeng Salas, then Arturo Tolentino.I grew up during the Martial Law years and I remember either having met or seen or currently read then all those capable men and women who fought, lived, and worked for democracy in our country.But for Ninoy, I can’t recall anything of lasting importance he actually did. The earliest memories I have of him are merely his videotaped political speeches or interviews circulated after his death.So, to sincerely and with all due respect ask: What law or measure has Ninoy Aquino done that actually, profoundly, and enduringly benefitted the Filipino as a united people and not just a certain sector thereof?",0
"Several netizens and lawmakers expressed their sadness after the majority of the members of Commission on Appointments ended the term of former Department of Social Welfare and Development secretary Judy Taguiwalo on Wednesday.Taguiwalo, who is considered as one of the top performing cabinet members of the Duterte administration received the most unexpected judgement from the members of the Commission on Appointments who also rejected former DENR Secretary Gina Lopez.Senator Ralph Recto, one of the senators who strongly supported the appointment of Taguiwalo as social secretary wrote a touching speech explaining why he endorsed the former DSWD secretary.The speech of Recto was scheduled to deliver if the confirmation hearings on Secretary Judy Taguiwalo had advanced to CA plenary for voting.The speech of Recto titled “To Serve the People” touched the netizens who supported Taguiwalo.In his speech, Recto showcased the educational background of Taguiwalo and explained why she deserved the position as social welfare secretary.This is the whole speech of Sen. Recto:‘To Serve the People’ Speech Endorsing the Confirmation of Prof. Judy Taguiwalo as Secretary of Social Welfare and DevelopmentSenate President Pro-Tempore Ralph G. Recto16 August 2017 Mr. Chairman, my dear colleagues: I have been told that the nominee is a fan of my grandfather, and of my wife. That she can recite passages from Don Claro’s writings. And hugot lines from the movies of Vi. So on that score alone, she gets my vote. But if my grandfather were alive today, he, Vi and the nominee, would make a mutual admiration club. Don Claro would only have the deepest esteem for someone who did not only agree with his causes, but spent a lifetime fighting for it. And Vi would find in her, as she does, a real life character who looms larger than Sister Stella L, and who has more guts and grit than all the strong women she had played on the silver screen. Mr. Chairman: The first pages of the nominee’s CV describe an intellectual at home in the academia. Retired professor of UP. Head of its Center for Women Studies. Director of Research and Extension for Development Office. Faculty Regent. In a school where merit is rewarded, she would not have been able to assume these posts without the academic degrees that validate a first-rate mind: She has a PhD from UP, a Masters from a Canadian university, and a Social Work degree from the same state university where she graduated cum laude in 1970. She could have been magna cum laude, Mr. Chairman, if she did not let her real-life education outside of UP interfere with her studies. Indeed, her CV catalogues, in fine print, the research papers, articles, books she had written.But what is not there are her other engagements in her storied life which I believe makes her qualifications more sterling – and prove without doubt her fitness to perform the duties of the office she holds. She is also an alumnae of three Martial Law prisons, went underground, and joined the resistance –only because legal pathways for change were blocked, and peaceful avenues to protest were closed. To those who would see this as impediment to a Cabinet post, here’s my rebuttal: Political imprisonment is no bar to public office and neither is the taking up of arms when conditions warrant. On the contrary— these are experiences we should look for in scouting for talent because they are the toughest “stress tests” one can endure. I don’t have to remind you that in our pantheon of heroes, those who were jailed for their beliefs occupy an honored place. Warriors, especially women, are revered, from Gabriela Silang to Tandang Sora. I think, Mr. President, that it is her work during the “unsalaried phase” of her checkered career which is her biggest qualification in holding the DSWD portfolio. It immersed her into the grinding poverty that continues to slave our people. It allowed her to closely see how the denial of basic social services drives people, first, to despair, and then, defiance. If the ideal DSWD secretary is one who possesses competence, compassion and commitment, then it can be said that UP gave her the first, her activism gave her the second, and her underground years gave her the third. We can never ask for a package as complete as her. She had been serving DWSD’s clientele long before Digong thought of running for mayor. So if we would like to know her views about poverty, we can leaf through the forest of newsprint that contains her writings. But if we would like to know if she really cares about the poor, then her stints in factories, in farms and in forests are enough to dispel any doubt. Mr. Chairman: The nominee should not be dismissed as one of the token Leftists in the Cabinet. She was not put there as a memento to prove Digong’s Big Tent approach in forming a government. Rather, I believe that she holds the post by virtue of her ability, and not by her affiliation. She is not there to represent one color in Digong’s rainbow Cabinet. She is there to serve all the colors in the tapestry of our democracy. She represents all of us, all our dreams, all our aspirations for our nation, our people, and our children. She personifies that elusive political ideal that persons of different persuasions can come together for the common good. If she is an ideologue, then the ideology she subscribes to is the same one we believe in, and that ideology is to serve the people. Mr. Chairman: I am seconding her confirmation because she brings a fresh perspective in the DSWD – and that is to treat not poverty’s symptoms but its roots, for the poor need more than relief, but a release from the social shackles that prevent them from bettering their lives. It is, therefore, my pleasure to endorse the confirmation of the appointment of Doctor, Professor Judy M. Taguiwalo, or Ka Judy, as Secretary of Social Welfare and Development.13 out of 24 members of the Commission on Appointments decided to reject Taguiwalo as DSWD secretary, but the names of the members were kept secret by the CA.She is the third member of the Duterte cabinet to be rejected by the CA.The same body had rejected the appointments of then Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr., and Environment Secretary Regina “Gina” Lopez.",0
"Remember Carlos Celdran, the artist and tour guide who vigorously defended Liberal Party presidential candidate Mar Roxas during the recent Philippine election campaign? He’s baaaack!Celdran first became famous when he staged a one-man protest during an ecumenical service in Manila, shouting and raising a placard with the word “Damaso” on it. A Manila court found him guilty of offending religious feelings. (Damaso is a character in national hero Jose Rizal’s novel who represented the abusive friars during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines).During the recent presidential campaign, he criticized a millennial BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) employee for complaining about Roxas and the Liberal Party.In a viral Facebook post on April 19, Celdran said “Without Mar and the Liberal Party, you WOULDN’T have that car NOR the job which paid for your freaking oversized Starbucks.”Now that his candidate has lost the election, Celdran has turned to designing clothes.His signature line is called, “Damian Domingo”, a collection of drawstring pants patterned after traditional costumes of 19th century Filipinos. In his Internet promo, Celdran says that these “breezy pants are literally the coolest thing you could ever wear. Made of 100% cotton, Damian Domingos are sewn by traditional craftsmen in Laguna and delicately embroidered with cocoon bullion patterns at the hem.” They are selling for P3,850, excluding shipping.There is, after all, life after Mar Roxas.",0
"On the canonization day of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero on Sunday, activist priest Fr. Robert Reyes dared Catholic Church leaders in the Philippines to emulate the life of the new saint and speak out against government abuses and violence against the Filipino people.“Does this silence amidst the extrajudicial killings and injustices against the poor a watered-down version of Christianity and a betrayal of Jesus Christ’s mission?” Reyes said in a phone interview on Saturday.Reyes said that among bishops in the Philippine Church, only three—Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo, Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David and Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas—had the courage to speak out their minds in defense of the poor and helpless.“The Church is afraid of activism. Is the Church fundamentally reactionary and conservative?” he said.In a statement, Reyes said Romero heard the same cries from oppressed and murdered Salvadorans during his time.“But he did not listen in silence. He became their voice,” said Reyes, who displays his activism often by running.Romero, archbishop of El Salvador, will be declared a saint at a Vatican ceremony on Oct. 14.Romero was murdered while celebrating Mass on March 24, 1980.",1

"Oriental Mindoro Rep. Reynaldo Umali on Friday said the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) had only itself to blame for the House of Representatives’ decision to cut the agency’s 2018 budget to P1,000.Umali, a lawyer who chairs the House justice committee, said the CHR never said a word when the human rights of congressmen were violated.“Actually we are victims ourselves,” he said, citing cases when the communist New People’s Army (NPA) extorted fees for permits to campaign in areas controlled by the insurgents.“There’s no effort to protect the rights of the elected representatives of the people,” said Umali, who graduated from Manuel L.

"The Office of the Ombudsman has filed graft charges against former Bureau of Immigration (BI) Acting Commissioner Teodoro Delarmente, former Acting Associate Commissioner Roy Almoro, former Associate Commissioner Jose Cabochan, and two others for allegedly allowing a convicted foreigner to leave the country in 2005.Also charged at the Sandiganbayan were former Executive Assistant Alejandro Fernandez and former legal aide Richard Perez.Assistant Special Prosecutor II Ma. Lourdes Mendoza of the Ombudsman accused the former BI officials of giving “unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to Vo Van Duc, a US national who was detained at the BI Detention Center, by preparing, approving and issuing Summary Deportation Order (SDO) AFF-05-043 dated May 5, 2005 despite Vo Van Duc having been convicted by the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City.”The SDO was “issued in violation of the rules and regulations on summary deportation and on the basis of an old Charge Sheet,” the prosecutor said, adding that its issuance allowed Van Duc “to leave the Philippines and effectively avoid service of his sentence.”Van Duc was reportedly convicted for violating Republic Act (RA) No. 8294 which prohibits the unlawful manufacture and possession of explosives.According to the charge sheet, he was sentenced to four years up to six years in prison for violation of Section 4 of RA No. 8494.The Ombudsman also filed graft charges against Delarmente, former Civil Security Unit Acting Chief Wendy Rosario, former Detention Center Acting Warden Noel Espinoza, and former Security Escort Marcelino Francis Agana for allegedly issuing medical passes in favor of Van Duc “without the BI physician’s recommendation for outside treatment or hospitalization” and for allegedly “allowing him to stay in an apartelle without justification and authority.”It recommended P30,000 bail for each of the respondents.",1
"ORGANIZED labor will file a petition for a new wage increase because of supervening conditions that will arise from the implementation of the new Tax Reform Acceleration and Inclusion (Train) Act effective January next year.The Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP) on Wednesday said they would push for an amendment to the new tax reform law to include forward programs that would alleviate the plight of the most affected sectors through skills training, competency improvement and job windows.“We still don’t have the figures for our wage petition. We are still in the process of consultation. We will also study the impact of the expected increase in the prices of basic commodities and services on the [current] take-home pay of workers,” ALU-TUCP spokesman Alan Tanjusay said.Under the the law, a wage petition can only be filed a year after the latest wage increase granted by a particular Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB).The wage board is also mandated to act motu propio or on its own to make the necessary salary adjustments for workers.Tanjusay noted though that the RTWPBs have the habit of approving salary adjustments that do not jibe with the economic situation on the ground.He cited as an example the P21 increase (P184 was the original petition) granted to minimum wage earners in the the National Capital Region (NCR or Metro Manila) that took effect last October.Tanjusay pointed out that the law allows the filing of new wage petitions even less than a year after the last wage increase if there are supervening events, like series of increases in the prices of commodities and basic services.The group opposes the government’s plan to provide discount vouchers to the poor impacted by Train, saying it would only teach people to be lazy and dependent on someone else.It said it would be better if the government provides the poor with cash-for-work program beginning with skills training and competency improvement and providing them with jobs.“Once millions of people become idle and lazy, it’s not sustainable, not good for our nation-building. But if we capacitate the poor to level up and give them the work opportunities, they become productive for our country, for themselves and for their families,” Tanjusay said.He added that there are already government institutions such as the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and the Department of Labor and Employment to provide the training needed and the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Public Works and Highways to provide the job opportunities.“We do not have to reinvent the wheel. We already have government institutions and experts in the bureaucracy who can provide the needed capacity-building and the work opportunities for the program,” Tanjusay said.According to the group, around 15.6 million most vulnerable underground economy workers will suffer more once the Train takes effect.Informal economy workers are those independent, self-employed, small-scale producers and distributors of goods and services. These are the jeepney drivers, tricycle drivers, pedicab drivers, taxi drivers, all kinds of vendors, sales attendants, barbers, cooks, waiters, dishwashers in carinderias (small restaurants) and canteens, tailors, sewers, porters and street sweepers.Though the Train widened the base of those exempted from income tax from minimum wage earners to mid-level wage earners by exempting those employees getting P250,000 a year or P21,000 a month and raised taxable bonuses from P82,000 to P90,000, these cannot mitigate the impact of Train on the underground workers.The Train will also collect excise taxes on coal, sweetened beverages and fuel and its by-products such as liquefied petroleum gas used in household cooking once enforced, increasing prices of basic commodities and cost of services including costs of electricity and water utilities.",1
"Let’s face it: America’s standing in the world is being challenged and probably waning.Yes, its military and economy remain the strongest in the world, but never doubt the power of the dragon. In fact, by some measures, China is already considered the world's largest economy. According to a report released last year by the International Monetary Fund that comparing international economies by adjusting for exchange rates and purchasing power, China's economy had already surpassed America's as the world's largest. As far as military strength is concerned, there’s no doubt the US military is head and shoulders above everyone else. But because most Americans have lost their appetite for direct military intervention, the US has considerably cut back on military spending while other countries, including China, have revved it up. Americans have lost their appetite because they’ve seen how direct military intervention has merely messed up other countries and sparked threats to their homeland. Some experts are of the opinion America’s Middle East foray gave birth to radical Islamic terrorism.In terms of trade, Japan remained the Philippines’ largest trading partner as of 2015, with the US in second, mainland China third and Hong Kong fourth. But if you combine the trade volume of mainland China and Hong Kong, the US slips back.The US loves to wave the “special relationship” flag. And why not? Filipinos LOVE the US. The US has consistently been cited as one of the Filipinos' favorite nations in the world, with 90% of Filipinos viewing the US and 91% viewing Americans favorably in 2002, 90% of Filipinos viewing US influence positively in 2011, 85% of Filipinos viewing the US and Americans favorably in 2013, and 92% of Filipinos viewing the US favorably in 2015, and 89% having confidence in US President Barack Obama in 2014, making the Philippines the most pro-American country in the world. So, if you think about it, the US may have been taking the Philippines and Filipinos for a ride because of the apparent blind loyalty of their “little brown brothers.”But something’s gotta give, and the US has to finally prove it has a “special relationship” with the Philippines and Filipinos in more tangible ways. I have a few suggestions:First, include the Philippines in its Visa Waiver Program. We’re “special,” right? So why shouldn’t we be included in that program? Thirty-eight countries appear to be more “special.”Second, provide the kind of infrastructure and soft-loan support China has approved—at the very least. We deserve support on the level of its Marshall Plan (approximately $120 billion in current dollar value) following the end of World War II.Third, because the US developed the now-decaying Philippine public school system during its colonial rule, renew its commitment to our public school system through an aggressive, well-funded educational aid and development program, including infrastructure, modern facilities, scholarships and training in the US.Fourth, it’s clear the US considers the Philippines strategic in terms of geography. Thus, it should be providing the Philippines military and other forms of grant-in-aid equal to that which it gives to ten other countries which currently receive such assistance. For starters, how about $500 million a year?The US should concede President Duterte’s gripes, skepticism and bitterness towards it have merit, because Duterte doesn’t share the blind loyalty of 80-90% of Filipinos.Fulfill these conditions, and perhaps we can truly say the US and the Philippines enjoy a “special relationship.”In short, prove it.---------------------David Nye as posted on Facebook",0
"It’s all over the news! Top Filipino celebrity Dingdong Dantes is reportedly set to resign as commissioner from the National Youth Commission (NYC). This follows Monday’s resignation of NYC chairman Gio Tingson “to campaign for the ruling party for the May 9 elections.”The Manila Times on the 31st of March reported that NYC executives were “being pressured to resign by the Liberal Party (LP) and actively campaign for administration standard bearer Manuel ‘Mar’ Roxas 2nd and Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo.”The report quotes the account of an inside source who revealed the abject desperation behind the motives of the LP…“Mar and Leni’s numbers do not fare well among the youth sector. They need to project that they have the support of the youth but they could hardly muster independent volunteers and pro-bono artists,” the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. “This is the reason why the NYC commissioners are being asked to resign and go full-time for the LP campaign,” he added.Interestingly enough, Dingdong Dantes was recently the subject of a media circus surrounding the “thoughtless extravagance” he and now-wife Marian Rivera exhibited during their lavish 2014 wedding. The gown of Rivera (now Mrs. Dantes) alone allegedly cost two million pesos and the wedding cake, a 12-foot masterpiece of Filipino food franchise Goldilocks Inc (which Dantes was, at the time, under contract to endorse), reportedly cost seven million pesos.It is interesting because an outrage fad is currently raging around the “massacre” of hungry farmers protesting in Kidapawan allegedly perpetrated by heavily-armed Philippine police officers at the scene to control the crowd. The outrage fad was anointed with the now-popular hashtag #BigasHindiBala (“rice, not bullets”) by social media “activsts” and has resonated powerfully across the Philippines’ chattering classes — the underlying presumption here being that people are “outraged” that the nation’s food growers are going hungry while millions of relatively well-fed Filipinos wear down rosary beads in daily prayer.That’s quite unfortunate for the embattled PR team of the Liberal Party (LP) which had suffered a string of public relations and mass communication gaffes that have all but killed the bid for the presidency and vice presidency of LP candidates Mar Roxas and Leni Robredo.Then again, perhaps the LP spin meisters may be counting on Filipino voters being too star-struck by the celebrity glitter of the Danteses. Will the Dingdong Dantes ace up the LP’s sleeve prove to be a boon or a bust to the fortunes of Mar and Leni in these elections?As always…Abangan ang susunod na kabanata.Same bat time, same bat channel…",0

"Manny Pacquiao might be heavily favored by the Filipinos to win in this Saturday’s (Sunday, Philippine time) welterweight boxing championship against American Floyd Mayweather, but the Filipino boxer’s chances of becoming president is very slim.Actor Dingdong Dantes is the overwhelming choice among likely voters in the 2022 Philippine presidential elections.Last week, The Adobo Chronicles reported that Dantes is being groomed to be the Liberal Party’s standard bearer in 2022, while Pacquiao has been anointed the presidential candidate for the opposing Nacionalista Party.In a scientific poll conducted by the Chronicles, Dantes, 34, leads Pacquiao, 36, by almost 3 to 1. An overwhelming 71.15% of respondents said that they will vote for the actor, compared to only 28.85% who said they will vote for the boxer. (Both are under-age to qualify for the 2016 elections.

"The Court of Appeals (CA) has ordered the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to comment on Mighty Corporation’s (Mighty) petition seeking to prohibit government raids on its warehouses.In a three-page resolution dated March 28, the CA directed BOC Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon and other officials under him to explain why it should not be ordered to stop its raids on the facilities of the embattled tobacco company.The resolution was penned by CA Justice Stephen Cruz and was concurred in by Justices Jose Reyes and Nina Antonio-Valenzuela.“In the meantime, without necessarily giving due course to the petition, private respondents are required to file their comment to the petition [not a motion to dismiss] within a non-extendable period of 10 days from receipt hereof. In turn, petitioner [Mighty] is given 5 days from receipt of the private respondents’ comment within which to file their reply,” it read.The CA also set a hearing on Mighty’s plea for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction to halt the BOC from implementing the mission orders issued by Faeldon.In its petition, Mighty assailed the denial of its application for injunctive reliefs by Branch 39 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila.Earlier, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the arrest of Mighty’s owner over allegations of bribery and the use of fake tax stamps on the packs of its cigarettes.Mighty manufactures Mighty Menthol 100’s Hard Pack, Mighty Menthol 100’s, Mighty Full Flavor King Size (red), Marvel’s Menthol 100’s, Marvel’s Menthol Hard Pack and Marvel Menthol 100’s (green).On March 7, the owner and lawyer of Mighty Corp., Alexander Wong Chu King, personally met with Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre 2nd to explain that the corporation has nothing to hide and has not committed any violation of the law.On March 8, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued an immigration lookout bulletin order against the Wong Chu Kings.On March 22, the Bureau of Internal Revenue filed before the DOJ a complaint against Mighty for the unlawful possession of articles subject to excise tax without payment of the corresponding excise tax and for possessing false, counterfeit, restored or altered stamps, a formal tax evasion.Among those charged by the BIR are Mighty’s president, retired Lt.

Kaya ang tanong, bakit?After arbitration, what's next? After the smoke has cleared, it's time to take a more sober approach and evaluate the situation in a more objective light. That is, let's ask the questions:Do we really understand what's going on? After all, I am a firm believe of what Gloria Steinem said decades ago:The truth will set you free. But first, it will piss you off. The objective of this article is to give you, the reader, a working understanding of the situation in the South China Sea. Note that the operative word is ""working understanding"", as I undoubtedly expect some smart-ass PolSci major who'll claim that this article paints an incomplete picture.So let's go.Why China wants the South China Sea China is a country that has experienced and is still experiencing intergalactic economic growth since the 1980s. Further growth, however, requires an important resource: energy.And that's what the South China Sea dispute is about. Screw national pride, screw sovereignty. The Philippines-China sea dispute is all about oil and natural gas.Just look at the table below to see how badly China needs energy:The table above was taken from a 2014 report by the China Energy Group of the United States Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [Over the past decade, it's clear that China's need for energy has been growing at an exponential rate. China has one of the largest coal reserves on the planet, and it's appetite for energy led it to become the not only the biggest coal consumer, but also the biggest coal producer in the planet today [China depends on coal for roughly 75 percent of its energy needs, according to the same report.China's coal, however, has its limits. Moreover, coal creates the greatest amount of pollution per unit of energy created [Downtown Shanghai on a sunny day. Even if China wanted to divorce itself from coal, it cannot do it right away because oil and natural gas, which are relatively ""cleaner"" than coal, are expensive and are derived from politically unstable sources.The same LBL report includes the following:Okay, let's list down some of the countries where China imports energy from: Coal : Indonesia 25%; Australia 25%; Vietnam 9%: Indonesia 25%; Australia 25%; Vietnam 9% Oil : Saudi Arabia 20%; UAE 8%; Libya 7%; Brazil 6%; Australia 4%; Yemen 4%: Saudi Arabia 20%; UAE 8%; Libya 7%; Brazil 6%; Australia 4%; Yemen 4% Natural Gas: Qatar 34%; Australia 24%; Indonesia 16%; Yemen 4%Now, here lies the problem: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, and Australia are very close US allies. Indonesia and Vietnam are not very fond of China. Yemen, Libya, and to a certain extent, Brazil, suffer serious political instability. Imports from Saudi, UAE, Yemen, and Libya, all pass through the Indian Ocean, and India is not in the best terms with China.We can now see that a considerable chunk of China's energy needs are sourced from either US allies or from politically unstable sources. Now, what if a war breaks out or if one of those politically unstable countries go into economic depression?The bottom line: China needs a secure and dependable source of energy, and the South China Sea is a very promising solution.Filipinos want exactly the same thing, hence the dispute.Now that we have a working understanding as to WHY this sea dispute exists, it's now time to briefly discuss HOW this dispute evolved throughout the years.A Short History Lesson Various areas of the South China Sea have been embroiled in disputes in as far back as 1876, when China claimed the Paracel Islands [ Chang 1991 ], despite Vietnam having built a pagoda somewhere in the island group in 1835 [ US 1974 ]. However, that is not exactly what we're concerned about, as our claim to the South China Sea is limited to the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Palawan's coast.Let's start. In 1978, President Marcos issued Presidential Decree 1599 [ Let ThinkingPinoy explain the face that launched a thousand tweets.A few days ago, the arbitration courts finally released its decision regarding the Philippines' claim in the South China Sea, or what we Filipinos stubbornly call the West Philippine Sea.

Upon signature, the Philippines declared:For over a decade, the Philippines and China remained relatively silent on the South China Sea issue, that is, until 1995.China occupied the Mischief Reef, which drew flak from the ASEAN. After negotiations, China agreed not to conduct further multilateral actions in the South China Sea [ Economist ].the Philippine Navy landed on Scarborough, blew up the territory monument that China had erected, and planted a flag of the Philippines on the island.China reacted by sending marine surveillance ships to the waters of the island, which faced a standoff with Philippine warships that did not ease until a few days later [ MB ].the Philippine Navy deliberately ran its landing craft BRP Sierre Madre aground at Ayungin Shoal, using hull leak repair as an excuse, and stayed there with regularly rotated soldiers, refusing to withdraw ever since [ ABS ].China and the ASEAN signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), probably in response to escalating tensions. The DOC essentially indicates:The PH-China dispute remained at a standstill for much of the 2000s until..., as it was the UNCLOS deadline for claims on seabed hydrocarbons (READ: Oil and Natural Gas) in the South China Sea [ Byrne 2012 ]. Let me state this more clearly: Per UNCLOS, countries who think they own oil and natural gas reserves in the South China Sea have until May 2009 to submit their claims.China and the Philippines do not really care about those useless rocks in the middle of the sea. Instead, they want what lies below., two months before the deadline, the United States reported that China harassed American surveillance vessels in the South China Sea [ NYT ]. The Americans say their vessels were just there for a routine exploratory mission. This served as the initial justification for American intervention in those waters.TP thinks the question, however, is why they are there at that time. Why didn't they explore the area much earlier or much later? What assurance do we have the American surveillance ship is not doing a seismic survey?the US tacitly admitted their error. Testifying before the US Senate, the US Department of State's Scot Marcial said:Here's the United States telling China they want a UNCLOS-compliant dispute resolution when in fact, the US did not sign UNCLOS to begin with.Regardless, the point here is the United States wants to have a major role to play in the South China Sea dispute, despite the fact they are not part of the UNCLOS, which is the basis of the dispute.The South China sea feud was largely confined to spicy rhetoric from all sides for the next two years, until 2011...MV Veritas Voyager was chartered by UK firm Forum Energy.

Pangilinan (MVP) controls Philex [ Inq ].Some government officials said this was a bad idea, causing a lot of public furor, with some groups saying that these naysayers don’t know what they’re talking about, and some saying that they fail to support Philippine interests with such statements.China does not have a reliable aircraft carrier fleet, so it’s safe to say that in the event of a confrontation, the 12 FA-50s will go against whatever is already stationed on the reclaimed island, at least for the first couple or so hours.However, China can quickly deploy their nuclear submarines from Yulin Naval Base in Hainan [ FAS ] to supplement their existing ground and air forces.Even with a quick and flawless initial PH blitzkrieg victory, China still has over 1,200 fighter aircraft left in its inventory. Hence, it’s unlikely that PAF will engage China on the reclaimed island, as PAF will easily be overpowered in no time.Besides, the Chinese will already be there before we make our first move.Now, the logical next step would be to ask help from the United States, right?That's one of the most common reactions ThinkingPinoy hears from the public. Well, after all, we do have a 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States [ Yale ].The problem, however, is that the idea of the US sending their forces to fight our war is met with at least five major obstacles.Recent developments suggest that US President Obama will be replaced by Hillary Clinton, another Democrat, as the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, is more of a seriously cruel joke than anything else [ Reuters ]. However, it’s stipulated that Congress will be Republican-dominated [ WaPo ]. Given the animosity between these two parties, it’s highly unlikely that Republicans will give the Democrat president an easy nod.Thus, we have this equation:Republicans historically love going to wars, but this equation makes everything unpredictable. Yes, the US can help us and No, the US cannot. What if we take a risk and allow China to bomb one of our ships then the US refuses to heed our call? Are you willing to take the risk?Assuming that the US Congress, for some reason, will be willing to hear out our request, our cause for invoking the MDT will be hinged on the ruling.However, the United States did not ratify UNCLOS [ Diplomat ] to begin with: UNCLOS thus has no legal weight over there. Congress can easily dismiss our request on the ground that it’s unconstitutional, as UNCLOS is not part of their body of laws in the first place.The US has spent trillions of dollars in waging wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since the dawn of the millennium [ Brown.edu ]. The US economy is already in bad shape, with lukewarm unemployment figures [ NYTimes ] and many cities suffering urban decay [ OSU ]. Aside from the potential burnout that the US Government and the US Public already feels, the idea of spending trillions to start a potential World War III is simply a bad idea.It's simply too expensive.Waging a war with the one you do the most business with is not a great idea. The US economy is already sputtering and it may even be headed to another recession [ ExpressUK ]. Waging a war with China will send this already sputtering economy to a halt. Moreover, a war with China means the ban of cheap Chinese imports to mainland US, which will, in turn, cause a sharp rise in cost of living or worse, severe commodity shortages.Moreover, in the event of a full-scale war, this trade embargo will be all-encompassing, similar to the US sanctions on Iran and the just-lifted sanctions on Cuba. This embargo will inevitably cover rare earth metals, as most of these come from China [ Diplomat ].This means two things: no more new advanced consumer electronics, and vastly limited capabilities on the part of the US to replenish their military equipment, as these rely heavily on computers and advanced electronics, which in turn require lots of rare earth metals to manufacture. And even if the war is short-lived, and assuming that the planet is not annihilated in the process, the economic embargo, at least in as far as rare earth metals, will probably stay in place.China has the largest standing army on earth [ Padmalingam 2002 ]. They can fight a protracted conventional war. The US, with its limited rare earth metal resources due to the embargo, will have no choice but to try to win a conventional war as quickly as they can. But what happens if years have passed, the war still ain’t over, and the US has run out scuds? They would have no other option but use their nuclear arsenal. This will force China to use it nukes too. And nobody wants that.Or worse, one of the sides can choose to use their nuclear weapons at the onset.ThinkingPinoy believes that at this point, it's pretty clear that military action is off the table, so we are left with the second option to enforce our claims: economic pressure.If we can’t/won’t/don’t go to war, can we just force the international community to sanction China This is just fair to ask, right? We have four options:The United Nations is the first place to go to if we want China to receive international sanctions [ UN ]. The problem, however, is that China is one of the five permanent members of UN Security Council [ UN ], which gives it the power to veto ANY PROPOSAL, including proposals to sanction itself. So no, that won't happen.The second option would be unilateral sanctions from the United States, but that will hurt the US more than China because of the fourth obstacle discussed in a previous paragraph (Obstacle 4). So no, that won't happen.The third option would be economic sanctions coming from the ASEAN, if that’s even legally possible. However, Cambodia maintains extremely close and almost filial ties with China [ Diplomat ], and adding the fact that ASEAN decision-making is consensus-based [ Aggarwal 2010 ], a simple “No” vote from one member – Cambodia in this case – will nullify any attempt. So no, that won't happen.Sanctions from other groups such as the EU or the UNASUR? Well, they have a negligible stake on the issue: the Spratly’s are too far away, and the threat of China invading them is close to zero. So basically, what do they care?Yes, France is currently pushing for coordinated EU patrols in the South China Sea [ Bloomberg ], but the operative word there is ""pushing"", which means that it has not happened yet. With uncertainty stemming from the UK leaving EU (Brexit) [ WSJ ], EU's help has become more unreliable than it already is.So no, that won't happen.Weeks before the decision, President Rodrigo Duterte challenged the United States.the Americans are willing to fight alongside us, would you be willing to go to war ?No, I am not talking about the AFP, I mean you, the regular Filipino. Would you be willing to go the frontlines and risk your own life?There you go.Now, do you understand Foreign Affairs Secretary Yasay's face after the South China Sea decision came out?Let me translate his face into words.With US military help out of the picture (at least for now)), we have no viable options to enforce our territorial claim. The least Yasay can do, being the face of Philippine foreign policy, is avoid showing too much excitement over the decision.Why? Because it will just piss China even more, making it more difficult for us to bargain.At the moment, our best shot is to strike a deal with China.We got some, China gets some. Now, compare that to getting nothing.I know we deserve a much better deal. But I also know that this is the best deal that we can get. ( ThinkingPinoy BITIN BA? Heto pa isa!Did you like this post?

"Rohanisa Abdul Jabar on Monday appealed to kidnappers who took her son, Ramram, in Manila seven years ago: “Give him back to me.”Ramram, whose full name is Azramie Magondacan, was taken from the family home in Tondo, Manila, in 2010 when he was 3 years old.Jabar has since been crying every day, praying and asking law enforcement agencies for help in recovering her son.Ramram, or Ramkoy, would have turned, or maybe turned, 10 in May, Jabar said she could not be sure.A certain Sittie Melva kidnapped Ramram with the help of his nanny Ula Arada on July 4, 2010. No one has learned whether he’s still alive.Jabar sought the help of the Manila Police District, National Bureau of Investigation and Philippine National Police anticrime emergency response—to no avail.She filed kidnapping charges against Arada and Melva but the case was dismissed.Four months after the boy’s abduction, the law enforcement agencies downgraded the case from kidnapping to missing, “because up to now, no one has demanded any ransom from me,” Jabar said in an interview with the Inquirer on Monday.To keep her hopes alive, Jabar maintained a Facebook page, “This Kid is Missing,” asking the public for help in disseminating Ramram’s pictures.Child soldierShe offered a P100,000 reward for information that would lead to the recovery of her child. After seven years there was nothing, except for insensitive pranks asking her for money.A message from Facebook user Omi Koto on Aug. 25 reignited Jabar’s hope. The unknown social media user sent her photos of a child soldier who allegedly fights for the Maute terror group in Marawi City, where Jabar was born.The similarities between the boy in the picture who carried an assault rifle and Ramram were so striking that Jabar said she trembled.“What if it’s he?” she said.In their last conversation, Omi Koto told Jabar he got the picture from a Bangsamoro Facebook page where pictures retrieved from the gadgets of Maute fighters were posted.Jabar said she had no way to verify if the boy in the picture was Ramram and Omi Koto could no longer be contacted.As she came to another dead end, Jabar appealed to Ramram’s kidnappers again.“If that boy is really my son, I have been waiting so long to get him back. If he is in the war zone, please return him to me. He is not your son,” she said.Jabar put the child soldier’s photo beside Ramram’s photo seven years ago and posted them on her Facebook page.She asked netizens to help her locate her son, or help her verify if the child soldier was the son she lost seven years ago.BirthmarkThe only way to verify is to see if the child soldier has the same birthmark as Ramram’s, she said.“He has a brown birthmark in his right jaw. That’s the only body mark that could tell us that he’s my son,” Jabar said.The military is verifying the authenticity of the pictures, Capt. Jo-Ann Petinglay, spokesperson for the military’s Western Mindanao Command, told the Inquirer on Sunday.Petinglay said civilians rescued from the battle zone in Marawi City had spoken of child soldiers fighting side by side with Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists.Col. Romeo Brawner, deputy commander of Task Group Ranao, confirmed that the terrorists were using child soldiers.“There’s no word yet from our intelligence operatives,” Petinglay said, referring to the verification of Ramram’s picture.No moving onJabar said relatives and friends were convincing her to move on. Her mother threw away Ramram’s only toy",1
"Fear and distrust is rife here. This country was one of the last I visited when backpacking South East Asia, and I noticed the difference immediately with all the armed guards literally everywhere and my guest house being in a weird protected community that had its own guard (I didn't even know about gated villages before, now I see guards every time I step outside).When you stay for longer and hear people's stories you learn that backstabbing and seething jealousy are accepted facts of life in most workplaces and neighbourhoods. I don't think they know that isn't normal.And where other countries have regional stereotypes about their own countryfolk (""anyone who lives outside the dead centre of the metropolis is a slack-jawed yokel""; ""anyone who lives in a rural area has intimate knowledge of livestock""), it seems many Filipinos actually believe them, and are regionalist to a laughable extent with their unshakeable beliefs about Manila people, Davao people… anyone beyond their front door, really.I don't get where the notion that the Filipinos are an especially loving people on the whole comes from. Because the kids live with their parents longer (because it's expensive to get their own place)? From the promoters of mail order bride and dating sites?

"When Shinzo Abe met Rodrigo Roa Duterte in Laos, the first thing that the Japanese prime minister told the Philippine president was, “You’re famous in Japan!“. He wasn’t kidding.Duterte is considered a rock star in Japan. His unconventional ways and tough talk have gained the admiration of the Japanese — both young and old.One famous concert venue in Tokyo advertised that it would freature the Filipino leader in a satellite feed from his hometown of Davao City where he just arrived from a state visit to Indonesia.The drug-free concert sold out just hours after the show’s organizers announced Duterte’s video appearance.As soon as Duterte came on the satellite feed, the concert crowd cheered and lit glow sticks, bringing the packed hall into a state of pandemonium.In his video message, Duterte encouraged the concert crowd to stay away from illegal drugs.Other concert venues and dance clubs throughout Japan are planning to hold similar events featuring Duterte’s live message from the Philippines.Many Japanese are looking forward to Duterte’s state visit to their country after learning that the Filipino leader has accepted the invitation from Abe.",0
"The freedom of information (FOI) bill pending in the House of Representatives would be ready for plenary discussions next month, said Akbayan Rep. Ibarra Gutierrez III.In a press conference here last week, Gutierrez said the FOI “was not given the opportunity to be discussed in plenary” because deliberations on the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) used up most of Congress’ time.“What we want to happen after the State of the Nation Address is for the House to give time for the FOI sponsorship speech, either within the same week or by August, before the budget deliberations,” Gutierrez said.The sponsorship speech is the first step for the measure to be taken up on the floor, he said. “We are determined to take up the FOI on the floor,” he said.The proposed FOI law (House Bill No. 3237) establishes the legal presumption that people should have full access to government information. It enumerates instances when data must be published online or transmitted to those interested “without the necessity of demand,” Gutierrez said.The measure was authored by Camarines Sur Rep. Maria Leonor Robredo and Batanes Rep. Henedina Abad.Gutierrez described the House version of the FOI bill as a “good version,” owing to its open data provisions, including a mandatory disclosure clause for budgets and expenditures, as well as the statement of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALN) of government officials and employees, including judges.At present, the Supreme Court screens requests made to access the SALN of justices.Gutierrez said the House proposal would also require contracts for projects commissioned by the government to be uploaded online.Senate Bill No. 1733 (proposed People’s Freedom of Information Act of 2013), which was passed on March 10, 2014, “is a classic FOI that is demand-driven,” Gutierrez said.The Senate bill requires an individual to proceed to an agency to request information, he said.The House version now has 50 sponsors, “and my sense is no one is against it,” provided some concerns about how the measure could be abused are addressed, Gutierrez said.Antidynasty provisionCongress is also prepared to take up on the floor the proposed Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) reform measure, which retains an antidynasty provision, he said.The SK measure disqualifies youth candidates if they are related to an elective official up to the second degree of consanguinity or affinity, he said.“ (If) you are the son of a mayor or a barangay captain, then goodbye. You can’t run for [any position in the] SK elections,” he said.“Take note, this provision is much stricter than the pending antidynasty measure itself because that bill disqualifies candidates who are related to elected officials up to the fourth degree of consanguinity,” he said.“The SK’s antidynasty provision does not provide exemptions. I believe the main antidynasty measure will offer exemptions,” he said.RELATED STORIESFOI bill gets budget, passes critical hurdleFOI bill limps to homestretch in HouseIt’s final: SK polls deferred to 2016",1
"Given slow spending on health facilities, Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno on Wednesday said the cut in the proposed budget of the Department of Health (DOH) for 2019 would stay.Diokno sought to ease fears that the cut would result in job losses among health workers.At a press briefing, Diokno noted that the DOH’s Health Facilities Enhancement Program (HFEP) had been “notorious in its slow disbursement rate” over the past decade.Of the total P138.1 billion allocated for the HFEP from 2008 until 2017, disbursements reached only P15.5 billion, or 11 percent of the 10-year appropriations, Diokno said.As for the cut in the total proposed DOH budget for next year, Diokno reiterated that this took into account the slow fund utilization of some of the department’s programs.False reportsDiokno also said reports that the DOH budget cut would displace health workers were “false.”For one, the DOH’s Human Resource for Health (HRH) Development Program, which lets the government contract medical professionals’ services, was allocated P9 billion for next year, the budget chief said.“Of this amount, P1.2 billion is allocated in the DOH budget, while P7.8 billion is lodged in the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund (MPBF). A huge sum was placed in the MPBF to give job security and full benefits to health professionals, as it will be used for the creation of permanent and contractual positions,” he said.While the proposed 2019 budget for the HRH declined by 6.2 percent from last year’s P9.6 billion, Diokno said disbursements in 2017 were only 77.4 percent or P6.4 billion of the P8.3-billion allocation.Vacant positions“This means the DOH was not able to fill all positions as funded” under last year’s budget, he pointed out.“This serves as our basis for the marginal decrease in the budget of the HRH. This should not result in job losses because you cannot cut what is not there to begin with,” he said.“In this sense, the DOH even has a larger budget as we are giving it P9 billion compared to the P6.4 billion it actually disbursed in fiscal year 2017,” he added.“We wish to give our health professionals job security and full benefits for their service by funding permanent and contractual positions, not just job order arrangements,” Diokno said.“We are doing this to be able to deliver a higher standard of health service to the Filipino people.”",1

"Did lawyer Mandy Anderson, the chief of staff of Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon, deliberately leak photos of her Facebook post calling Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez an “imbecile” to deflect public attention from the multibillion-peso smuggling of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) through the Bureau of Customs (BOC) express lane?Was the leak the perfect opening Anderson sought to accuse Alvarez of influence-peddling when he allegedly tried to get an “unqualified” Customs official promoted?This was the conclusion drawn by Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas, who confronted Anderson about her Facebook post during the House ways and means committee hearing on Wednesday.In a group message to House reporters, Fariñas cited the timeline of events to show that Anderson’s allegations against the Speaker were part of “clear machinations to cover up the smuggling of P5 billion of shabu” from China.Anderson however described Farinas’ conclusion as “an absurd allegation not backed by a single piece of evidence.”She added that the “theory would not only be an insult to the other members of the House, but would truly [show] the sad state we are living in, if our elected representatives can be distracted from a major shabu smuggling issue just because of the Facebook post of a ‘nobody.’”In a June 16 Facebook post where she shared an Inquirer story about Alvarez’s threat to dissolve the Court of Appeals over an interbranch spat in the case of six detained Ilocos Norte officials, Anderson wrote: “I’m hoping and praying he tries so he realizes what an imbecile he is when he fails.”She added: “Isn’t there anyone else in the House composed of 200-plus representatives who can actually be Speaker? Nakakahiya na (It has become embarrassing).”On July 25, “or a day before the hearing on drug smuggling, several House members received a copy of Anderson’s ‘imbecile’ post,” Fariñas said.Hindsight“Who could have leaked her private post if not she herself and her cohorts in order to divert the public from the House investigation of the successful smuggling of more than P5-billion worth of shabu through the BOC Express Lane?” the House official said.“Hindsight is the best sight—isn’t the dragging of the name of the Speaker by AA (Attorney Anderson) a clear attempt to divert the issue on the BOC’s ineptitude, given all the former military officials in its leadership? Were it not for China’s apprehension in Xiamen of the source of the shabu and its alerting the BOC of the smuggling of almost a ton of shabu, the BOC’s ‘Express Lane’ would have successfully facilitated P5-billion worth of shabu into our country,” Fariñas said.Beef with AlvarezAnderson, who said her “imbecile” comment was on a “private” page, later apologized for the post, but explained in an interview after the hearing that her beef with Alvarez had started in May after the Speaker tried to get a BOC official promoted to Customs operations officer 5.The BOC official said she refused after learning that the officer, later identified as a certain Sandy Sacluti, was not qualified for the promotion. The Speaker later called her to his office and berated her, Anderson said.She added that Alvarez’s staff started sending her threatening messages and in a phone call, supposedly told her that the Speaker’s marching orders were to “bring hell to [her] and the commissioner.”Alvarez earlier denied the allegation, calling it a figment of Anderson’s imagination. But on Friday, he confirmed that he had indeed endorsed a Customs officer for promotion in a May 15 letter to Customs Commissioner Faeldon. But it was not “lobbying,” the Speaker said; just one of his many routine recommendations.",1
"PresseUS President Donald Trump said Friday he had doubled steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkey, adding to pressure on that nation’s troubled economy amid a diplomatic row with Washington.“I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!” Trump said on Twitter.“Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!”Trump’s announcement came as Turkey’s embattled lira hit new record lows against the US dollar and euro, losing nearly nine percent in value as strains with the United States showed no sign of abating and fears grew over the exposure of European banks.Turkey remains at loggerheads with the United States in one of the worst spats between the two NATO allies in years over the detention for the last two years of American pastor Andrew Brunson and a host of other issues.Washington this month imposed sanctions on senior Turkish officials, angering President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and prompting retaliatory measures by Ankara.Meanwhile, markets are deeply concerned over the direction of economic policy under Erdogan with inflation at nearly 16 percent but the central bank reluctant to raise rates in response.Erdogan on Friday called on Turks to support their struggling currency.“We will not lose the economic war,” state-run TRT Haber television quoted Erdogan as saying.“If you have dollars, euros or gold under your pillow, go to banks to exchange them for Turkish lira. It is a national fight.”Harsher US tariffs were likely to punish Turkey’s already faltering steel exports to the United States.In the first three months of 2018, Turkish steel exports to the United States fell nearly 50 percent over the same period in 2017, making it the only top 10 source of US steel imports to see a decrease, according to the US Commerce Department.",1
"Vice President Jejomar Binay and his son Junjun unlawfully approved supplemental budgets amounting to P14 billion from 2007 to 2011 to fund several infrastructure projects during their tenure as mayors of Makati City, according to the Commission on Audit (COA).The amount included the P2.8 billion for the construction of the Makati City Hall Building II when the elder Binay was still mayor in 2008.The alleged irregularities stemming from the construction of the controversial 11-story parking building prompted the Office of the Ombudsman to impose a lifetime ban on the younger Binay from working in the government.In a 148-page audit report, a copy of which was obtained by the Inquirer, the state auditors said Binay approved multimillion-peso infrastructure projects that were not contained in the city’s annual procurement plan.The report dated March 7 was prepared by a 12-member audit team headed by lawyer Chona Labrague. The team spent 90 working days to complete the audit.The Vice President had earlier accused Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales of trying to influence the COA to make public the audit report. She said Binay’s allegation was “a lie.”In its report, the state audit body said the construction of the parking building “showed irregularities from budgeting to procurement to execution resulting in misuse of public funds.”The COA said funds for the infrastructure projects were “sourced from… loans, unappropriated surplus or savings of the executive budget and surplus of income.”‘Bloated’ budgetIt said copies of the statements of receipts and expenditures revealed that the budget was “bloated” by P1.24 billion in 2007 and P2.3 billion in 2008, the year the parking building was supposedly finished.The financial statements made it appear that the funds were proceeds of loans “which were verified to be not actually released” by state-owned Land Bank of the Philippines, the COA said.But records showed that the loans were actually released in 2010, which the COA said violated Republic Act No. 7160, or the Local Government Code of 1991. It says that “no ordinance providing for a supplemental budget shall be enacted except when supported by funds actually available as certified by the local treasurer.”“The bloated figures appear to be made to conceal the fact that various projects, including the (parking building)… were implemented even without the actual release of the loan,” the COA said.The COA also confirmed that the contracts for the five phases of the parking building construction awarded to Hilmarc’s Construction Corp. “were not an outcome of actual competitive bidding.”It said the local bids and awards committee violated RA 9184, the Government Procurement Reform Act, by giving “undue advantage” to Hilmarc’s.The younger Binay has denounced the release of the COA report, which he said was timed to coincide with his father’s campaign for the presidency.Binay’s United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) Thursday warned COA that it may be held liable for the release of the incomplete special audit report, saying this is prohibited during the election period.UNA president Toby Tiangco said he wrote the COA on Feb. 21 requesting it to abide by its rules, which bar special audits against candidates in the 2016 elections.He also reminded that parties involved in COA audits should be given the chance to comment on any findings, otherwise the body will be “violating due process and the rights of individuals.”In a statement, Tiangco said he had information that “a PR consultant working for the Ombudsman provided copies of the COA report to select authorities.”“To this we ask why, if the case against us is strong, would there be any need for underhanded tactics?” Tiangco said.Sen. Gregorio Honasan, Binay’s vice presidential running mate, said it would serve public interest if COA Chair Michael Aguinaldo would state that the special audit was “procedural” and not meant to single out Binay.“It will help to defuse the highly charged political situation,” he said.

"A group of rice importers on Friday strongly urged the National Food Authority (NFA) to extend the importation of rice until March 31.Edwin Paraluman, chairman of the Philippine Farmers Advisory Board (PFAB), told the media that it is unfair that NFA Administrator Jason Aquino allowed other importers to import rice from Pakistan and India until March 31, while his group that imports rice from Thailand and Vietnam were prevented to import before the end of February.Paraluman said Aquino’s decision was a clear proof of double standard.The PFAB and its allied organizations have already lost P6 billion as of March 3.It is seen to increase if the NFA will not reconsider its position on their group.According to Paraluman, the stoppage of his group’s importation has so many effects, apart from the P6-billion loss of income, such as possible increase in the unit price of rice.He said his group is a big help to the country, and Aquino should allow them to import rice until March 31.Paraluman pointed out that they already paid the necessary taxes to the government for the importation.NELSON S.

Leila de Lima who is facing three illegal drug trade complaints at the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court (RTC) would be staying longer at the police headquarters as the court has rescheduled the hearing on her motions to dismiss her cases to next month.Branch 205 Judge Amelia Fabros-Corpuz gave the prosecutors from the Department of Justice (DOJ) 10 days to comment on the senator’s motions to quash and judicial determination of probable cause.The prosecution was also ordered to reply within 10 days to the motions of Jose Adrian Dera, De Lima’s coaccused on the case, for judicial determination of probable cause and to hold the issuance of warrant of arrest.The defense, in turn, was given another 10 days to comment on the prosecution’s motion to consolidate all the cases.The next hearing has been scheduled for April 21, or after the Holy Week.According to the DOJ, Dera, a former aide of the senator, demanded millions of pesos and vehicles for De Lima’s senatorial run from convicted drug lord Peter Co.Last week, the DOJ prosecutors submitted a motion asking Judge Juanita Guerrero of the Muntinlupa RTC Branch 204 to consolidate the cases handled by Branches 205 and 206, and the case in her court into a single case that she alone would try.De Lima’s counsel previously said the defense would oppose the motion, as all three cases would be heard by Guerrero, who had ordered the senator’s arrest just three days after the justice department filed the complaint against the lawmaker.The Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday the motion of De Lima for the high court to review her case and to bar Guerrero from hearing her cases.De Lima had asked the high tribunal to order the inhibition of Guerrero from the case for prejudging it and for grave abuse of discretion in issuing the arrest warrant with “undue haste and inordinate interest.”The three cases arose from complaints brought by the National Bureau of Investigation and Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption based on testimonies during the House of Representatives’ inquiry into the alleged illegal drug trade in New Bilibid Prison during De Lima’s term as secretary of justice.",1

"The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) is accusing the United States government of allegedly having a hand in the military operations against the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in Inabangan, Bohol last April 11.“The news stories regarding the supposed arrival and presence of members of the Abu Sayyaf criminal bandit group in Bohol island smacks of a US yarn. The Filipino people find most of the press statements released by the military, police and local government officials as highly suspect,” a statement issued by the CPP on April 14 said.Contrary to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) report that six ASG members were killed, along with a policeman and three soldiers, the CPP contends that two of the fatalities counted among the Abu Sayyaf were actually a civilian couple.The CPP said it turned out later that two among the so-called bandits were a 65-year-old couple identified by the barangay officials as Constancio and Crisente Petalco, residents of Barangay Napo.The CPP condemned the military operation in Bohol as “overkill,” claiming it endangered the lives of the residents and forced at least 1,200 local residents to flee their homes after the Philippines Air Force dropped nine bombs in Barangays Napo, Calenti and Banahao in Inabangan town.“The AFP media office, known for spinning fake news stories, has produced a highly dubious story of no less than 60 fully-armed men who traveled three hundred kilometers by boat from Sulu to Bohol, unhampered by the whole AFP establishment, then upstream to a place unknown to them with only a general plan to ‘target tourists,” it said.“This story is a typical of the tall tales spun by the US Central Intelligence Agency and their conspirators within the Philippine defense and security establishment,” it said.The CPP also questioned the timing of the travel advisory warning issued by the US Embassy prior to Bohol clash against travelling to Cebu and Bohol, “which the AFP and PNP (Philippine National Police) had no idea of.”The US Embassy issued on April 9 a travel advisory, which claimed it received “unsubstantiated yet credible information that terrorist groups may attempt to conduct kidnappings in Central Visayas, which included both Cebu and Bohol provinces. US citizens are advised to carefully consider this information as you make travel plans, and to review personal security plans, avoid large crowds and gatherings, and remain vigilant at all times.”The communists alleged the “tall tale of the presence of the Abu Sayyaf in Bohol likely forms part of a US plot to strengthen its foothold and increase the presence of its troops in the Central Visayas region.”It added this shows the interest of the US military to establish facilities at the Mactan airfield.“The US military also aims to establish itself more firmly in the Eastern Visayas region having established US facilities in Guian, Samar under the guise of post-Yolanda rescue operations. The annual Balikatan exercises are set to be carried out starting April 24 in Leyte, just north of Bohol,” it said.It accused the AFP and the US military of collaborating with the operators of the ASG.“Recall that the Abu Sayyaf was originally formed in the 1980s by a group of armed men recruited by the US military to join the Taliban group which waged a CIA-hatched ‘jihad’ against the then Soviet-supported Afghanistan government,” it said.It added the US and AFP have used the ASG as multi-tool to discredit the Moro people’s struggle for self-determination.",1
"Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV on Sunday cautioned Supreme Court justices who reportedly wanted to remove Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno that they themselves could be impeached.In a statement, Trillanes said it would be unconstitutional to remove Sereno through a process other than impeachment.Doing so would be a brazen usurpation of the exclusive power of Congress under the Constitution, he said.“In view of certain reports that certain Supreme Court justices, headed by Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, are maneuvering to force the unconstitutional removal of Chief Justice Sereno, may I remind these justices that any unconstitutional act they commit now, can be used as a ground for impeachment against them later on under a different administration,” Trillanes said.",1
"The Land Transportation Office (LTO) has suspended its memorandum requiring vehicle dealers to secure uniform temporary license plates.LTO chief Edgar Galvante on Thursday announced the suspension during a meeting with car and motorcycle dealers.He said the suspension will be effective for three months.During the meeting, the dealers asked for more time so they could comply with the specifications the LTO had set for the uniform temporary license plates.The requirement, they argued, likewise affected their efforts to expedite the processing of their clients’ documents.The LTO memorandum, which became effective February 15, mandated dealers to adhere to a specified font, design and the material for the temporary license plates for uniformity and ease of visual recognition.This was also to ensure that only registered motor vehicles are operating on roads.",1

"After a series of Executive Orders ranging from repealing Obamacare to building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, Donald Trump today announced the most controversial act in his week-old presidency. He is calling for a new U.S. presidential election.Claiming that there had been massive fraud during last November’s election resulting in Hillary Clinton’s wide lead in the popular vote, Trump issued a new Executive Order for a repeat presidential election on March 1, 2017.Trump charged that Clinton’s lead in the popular vote came from millions of non-existent voters and “illegal immigrants.” He also pointed out that many voters were registered in two or more precints, including some of his top White House aides.“I will not settle for anything but a clean sweep of the elections, both the electoral and popular votes,” he said,”and I simply cannot accept that Hillary won the popular vote.

"Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya will be made to face charges for the problems of the Metro Rail Transit (MRT), according to Sen. Grace Poe.Poe said the Senate subcommittee on public services, which she heads and which conducted hearings into the MRT’s problems, will be submitting a report in which it will recommend the filing of charges against Abaya and other officials responsible for the MRT’s woes.Abaya was liable for “negligence of duty,” the presidential aspirant told a student forum at the Angeles University Foundation here Friday.No cases have been filed against Abaya but Poe seems to consider him the root of the MRT’s problems.“The problem with the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) is its leadership or [the] lack of it,” she said.Poe earlier criticized Abaya for his “incompetence and shortsightedness.”“He should be charged. He is responsible,” she said.Amid calls for his resignation, Abaya said it was President Aquino alone who can decide whether he should be replaced.Poe earlier called on the President to fire Abaya on grounds of incompetence but Mr. Aquino said Abaya would stay on until the end of the President’s term.Poe, who is pursuing her candidacy for the country’s top post despite serious disqualification issues against her, also expressed frustration that as a lawmaker she could only conduct inquiries, hold hearings and make recommendations but cannot “fire incompetent officials or take action” like the executive.Threat of withdrawalThe Poe committee held an emergency hearing at the Senate early this month following reports that the maintenance service provider of the MRT 3 had withdrawn from the contract that it had been awarded.The loss of the maintenance provider, she said, would increase the risk for more than 600,000 daily commuters.An Inquirer report had said that the Korean-based Busan Transport Corp., the minority partner in a consortium with four Filipino firms in the consortium that won the P3.8-billion, three-year MRT 3 maintenance contract, was backing out for fear of lawsuits over the way the contract had been awarded.But Busan has apparently not withdrawn. The President castigated the press reports about the alleged withdrawal and stressed that the Korean company would maintain the MRT for the next three years.Busan dealThe consortium had won the contract last month and was scheduled to take over from the previous maintenance provider last Jan. 6.The MRT 3 recently received 48 new light rail vehicles (LRVs), which was part of the capacity expansion project of the DOTC.The deal with Busan also covers the overhaul of 43 coaches over the period covered by the agreement and the replacement of the signaling system within 24 months.Poe said the DOTC should have tested the LRVs before these were accepted. She said the rail tracks should be changed to carry four units per train, instead of the current three units.The chemical components of the vehicles should have also been assessed, she said.Attempts to bid out the MRT 3 contract in September 2014 and January 2015 failed because no bidders participated. The DOTC said it had to resort to an alternative mode of procurement in accordance with the provisions of the Government Procurement Reform Act of 2003, because of the urgent need to address the railway’s maintenance requirements and the rail system’s core problems of obsolescence and complete wear-and-tear.Politicians and militants have been demanding the dismissal of Abaya for failing to address the major problems besetting the MRT 3, including the frequent breakdowns and the inadequacies of its coaches and station facilities.RELATED STORIESWhy spare Abaya?

"The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has released a P54-million budget to supply free medicines to indigent patients from all over the country under its “Libreng Gamot Para Sa Masa” (Lingap Sa Masa) program.Started in March 2017, Lingap Sa Masa is a project of President Rodrigo Duterte that aims to provide P1-billion worth of medicines to indigent patients.In partnership with select hospitals like the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH), the DSWD continues to implement the program as the agency has reached out to 1,051 indigent patients through the UP-PGH Lingap.Among participating hospitals, Jose B. Lingad Memorial Hospital in San Fernando City, Pampanga, has registered the highest utilization amounting to P24-million worth of medicines accessed by 2,386 patients.From Region 6, about 2,280 patients have also benefited from the free medicine program, while 1,905 indigents were served in the two participating hospitals in the Davao region.Patients who avail of free medicines are mainly individuals from poor families or are vulnerable, disadvantaged informal sectors, depending on assessments done by social workers.The DSWD said those who need to avail of the program must bring a valid ID; doctor’s prescription issued within the last three months, indicating date and name of the patient, signed by attending physician; and proof of indigency or any certificate issued by the barangay (village) or medical social service from a hospital.DSWD Secretary Judy Taguiwalo hoped that more Filipinos will be able to benefit from the program.“There remains much to be desired when it comes to our public healthcare system, and among the factors that stand in the way of Filipinos’ access to quality healthcare is the cost of medicine and medical procedures and treatment. Agencies like the DSWD contribute to efforts to make healthcare services more accessible to the poor and sectors in need. Lingap Para sa Masa is an important program we have which we hope will benefit many Filipinos,” she said.The department said more than P900 million is still left in the budget for free medicine provided by the Office of the President.",1
"Days before New Year’s Eve in 2014, a boy in Manila lost his left hand when he lighted a piccolo which exploded before he could throw it.The tiny but powerful piccolo, a banned firecracker, has remained the leading cause of fireworks-related injuries during the New Year festivities.Its colorful packaging that sometimes comes with a cartoon character attracts the young since children could easily mistake it for candy, said Health Secretary Janette Garin.Piccolo can produce a big bang, like the bawang, a firecracker shaped like a garlic bulb that explodes like a grenade, and whose use is approved by authorities.A dose of 50 to 100 milligrams of the yellow phosphorus substance found in piccolo could be lethal to humans.Burns and vomiting are the immediate symptoms in a person affected by piccolo contamination. The effect is life-threatening enough that immediate medical attention is recommended for anyone coming into contact with it. Simple first-aid steps will not do.If children swallow a piccolo, they should not be made to vomit but should instead be given six to eight raw egg whites—adults may be given eight to 12 raw egg whites—before being brought immediately to the hospital, health officials said.Piccolo can also damage the eyes and the skin, not to mention any extremities reached by its blast. It is also dangerous when inhaled.The high demand for piccolo hampers government efforts to regulate the use and sale of the banned firecracker.This type of firecracker is being smuggled into the country from China and repacked in the Philippines, said Lt. Angelito Cruz, assistant chief of the environmental protection unit of the Bureau of Customs.Several bills banning the sale of firecrackers to minors or their use in densely populated areas have been filed in the Senate and House of Representatives.Of the 455 firecracker-related injuries reported as of Jan. 2, 245 cases, or 54 percent, were caused by piccolo.READ: DOH: ‘Piccolo’ lead cause of fireworks-related injuriesSources: DOH, senate.gov.ph, Inquirer ArchivesRELATED STORIESDOH urges ban on ‘piccolo’ firecrackerFirecracker-related injuries up to 181; ‘piccolo’ still most notorious",1
"Despite opposition from his economic managers, President Duterte on Thursday signed a law granting tuition-free education in all state universities and colleges (SUCs), a move hailed by lawmakers who now have the task of looking for ways to fund the measure.Warnings of a hefty price tag for the bill did not deter Mr. Duterte, who thought its benefits would far outweigh the cost, Deputy Executive Secretary Menardo Guevarra told reporters in Malacañang on Friday.Guevarra said free tertiary education in SUCs was “a very strong cornerstone of the President’s social development policy.”“So he weighed everything and came to the conclusion that the long-term benefits that would be derived from a well-developed tertiary education on the part of the citizenry will definitely outweigh any possible short-term budgetary challenges,” he said.“So if there’s a will, as we say, there’s a way,” he added.It’s up to Congress to look for funding for the new law, he said.“In my opinion, if the Congress is really serious about finding the appropriate funding for this free tuition program, they would have to find the necessary sources for this particular program,” he said.It could allocate resources and make other adjustments during the budget deliberations, he said.Budget Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno said on Friday that the new law would be implemented next year.As such, it will entail changes in the proposed P3.767-trillion budget for 2018.“The law is forward-looking. It cannot be applied retroactively. Hence, in the immediate term, we’re talking of academic year 2018-2019,” Diokno said.“My immediate concern are those enrolled in the 114 SUCs. There should be no expansion in student population. The estimate has to be preceded by [a predetermined number of students, say ‘x’], who are chosen on the basis of a nationwide test administered by the Commission on Higher Education. Unless we know ‘x,’ we can’t give an estimate,” he said.Also, he added, “there will be changes in the President’s 2018 budget, which has some P16 billion in various types of scholarships.”Diokno said he would head the committee that would prepare the implementation rules for the free tuition law.During the first congressional hearing on the 2018 budget on Tuesday, Mr. Duterte’s economic managers said P100 billion would be needed to fully subsidize tuition in the SUCs.The Duterte administration has planned a whopping P8 trillion-P9 trillion infrastructure spending until the end of the President’s term in 2022.To fund that, the administration has asked lawmakers to pass new revenue measures.Adjustments in 2018 budgetDavao City Rep. Karlo Alexei Nograles, head of the appropriations committee of the House of Representatives, said on Friday that P8 billion to P16 billion would be earmarked in the 2018 budget to fund the new law.Nograles said his committee would source the funds from “underperforming agencies and those with poor absorptive capacity.”“I can safely say that there is enough money to jump-start this and sustain it in the long term,” he said, playing down concerns about the lack of money to fund the measure in next year’s budget.Senators praised Mr. Duterte for his decision and vowed to cut “excess fat” in the 2018 budget to fund the free tuition program.“We will have to scour the pig pen again and cut the pork to fund it,” said Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who led the purge of the 2017 budget to realign P8.3 billion in pork allocated to some congressmen to SUCs through the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd).Sen. Loren Legarda, chair of the Senate finance committee, promised to ensure funding for the free tuition law.She also called on the CHEd to work for the implementation of the law during next school year.“We will scrape around for funds, which is what happened last year,” said Sen. Sonny Angara, head of the Senate ways and means committee.“We hope it can be done again, [as] the executive failed to put funding in their submitted budget for 2018,” he added.Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto was optimistic that the proposed 2018 budget had enough room to accommodate the “more important mandates” of the new law.“We’ll have to liposuction the fat and transform it into funds for state colleges,” Recto said.Lacson said the allocation for SUCs in the 2018 budget was initially estimated at P20 billion.Sen. Francis Escudero said P14 billion would be earmarked for SUCs and P1 billion for local universities and colleges (LUCs).Trade schools—locally called technical-vocational institutions—under the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority will be allocated P5 billion, he said.Escudero pointed out that the amount is a mere .5 percent of the proposed budget for 2018. Full implementation of the new law would require around P43 billion, or a little over 1 percent, of the proposed budget for next year, he said.Aid and donationsRepublic Act No. 10931, or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act, also allows the free tuition program to be funded by official development assistance and local and international donations, Guevarra said.He said the economic managers’ estimate of P100 billion needed to implement the measure was the high side, as it was based on the assumption that all aspects of the law would be implemented all at the same time.The mandatory provisions—free tuition and other miscellaneous fees for students in SUCs, LUCs and state-run trade schools—would be implemented first and would cost about P16 billion, as estimated by the CHEd.As for the provisions for other related educational expenses such as room and board, books and transactions, Guevarra said these would be covered by a subsidy fund that had yet to be established.The subsidy fund would be administered by the board of the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education program.On the earlier objection of economic managers, Guevarra said everyone had to help implement the law.“Whether or not you were originally opposed to it, that’s now beside the point. All we need to do now is to unite and coordinate all our efforts in trying to find the solution to the most important problem confronting this program, and that’s really the budgetary allocation, the funding for this program,” he said.The law requires SUCs and LUCs to set up a system that would allow students with the financial capability to pay their tuition to voluntarily opt out of the tuition and other school fee subsidy or make a contribution to the school.ExemptionsExempted from free tuition are students who already have a bachelor’s degree or comparable undergraduate degree from any higher education institution, and those who fail to comply with the admission and retention policies of the state-run schools.Also exempted are students who fail to complete their bachelor’s degree or comparable undergraduate degree within a year after the period prescribed in their program.In state-run trade schools, also exempted from free tuition are students with a bachelor’s degree or certificate or diploma for a technical-vocational course, and those who fail in any course they are enrolled in during the course of the program.Those who violate the law face imprisonment for six months to one year, or a fine ranging from P20,000 to P100,000, or both.",1
"The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Marquette University shouldn’t have fired a conservative professor over his blog post that criticized a student instructor he believed shut down discussion about opposition to gay marriage.The ruling concluded that the Catholic school breached its contract guaranteeing academic freedom with former professor John McAdams. The court said McAdams should immediately be reinstated.The court’s decision came down on ideological lines. The conservative majority sided with McAdams, saying the faculty panel that recommended his discipline had an “unacceptable bias.” The liberal justices called the decision “far reaching,” and said academic freedom “does not protect McAdams from discipline.”McAdams sued the university in 2016, arguing that he lost his job for exercising freedom of speech. Marquette argued that he wasn’t fired for the content of his 2014 post, but because he named the instructor and linked to her personal website that had personal identifying information. The instructor later received a flood of hateful messages and threats.The case has been closely watched by conservatives who see universities as liberal havens, as well as private businesses that want control over employee discipline.In the November 2014 blog post, McAdams described an interaction between a conservative student and a graduate student instructor of philosophy. The student claimed the instructor refused to allow discussion about opposition to gay marriage during a class and provided McAdams with a recording he secretly made of a conversation with the teacher after the class.That formed the basis for McAdams’ post, in which he argued that the students’ experience was another example of liberals silencing people whose opinions they disagree with or find offensive. The post included the student-teacher’s name, a link to her personal website and her email address, and it led to a flood of hateful messages.The threats were bad enough that the university posted a security officer outside of her classroom and she noticeably lost weight. The graduate student eventually moved to another university, where she had to repeat three semesters and revise her PhD thesis.“Had he written the exact same blog post and not included the student-teacher’s name and contact information he would not have been disciplined,” Ralph Weber, Marquette’s attorney, had argued. “He’s being disciplined for his conduct, not any viewpoint.”McAdams’ attorney, Rick Esenberg, said that argument was “fundamentally dishonest” and that all McAdams did was link to publicly available information.McAdams published his post on his personal website, “Marquette Warrior.” His lawsuit argued that he has used the site for more than a decade to condemn political correctness and the silencing of ideas that might be hurtful to protected classes, according to his lawsuit against the school.McAdams was given the chance to return to work after his suspension, provided he write a letter apologizing for his conduct. The letter was to be shared confidentially with the student instructor, but McAdams refused to write it.",1
"Newly appointed Presidential anti-corruption commissioner Greco Belgica questioned why the senators from the Liberal party were calling Special Assistant for the President (SAP) Christopher “Bong” Go for a senate investigation on the Philippine Navy’s frigate project.In his lengthy Facebook post, Belgica labeled Senators Kiko Pangilinan, Franklin Drilon and Antonio Trillanes IV as thieves that trying to convince the people that they were fighting corruption by investigating Bong Go without any sufficient reason.He believed that the opposition were only trying to discredit President Rodrigo Duterte again by hitting and shaming Go.Belgica also listed several reasons, why Bong Go must not be invited in the senate.According to him, Defense Secretary Lorenzana and former Navy Flag Officer in Command Vice Admurak Ronald Joseph Mercado already cleaned the name of Bong Go over the navy project controversy.He pointed out that the navy project deal happened during the former Aquino administration, so he believed that Duterte and Go were not involved in the controversy.Belgica also questioned why the case was brought in the senate and not in the Office of the Ombudsman if there’s a sufficient evidence against Go.The anti-corruption commissioner urged the people to fight back to block the opposition senators from trying to discredit Bong Go in public.He also listed the alleged money got by the LP senators from the controversial Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) of the Aquino administration.Belgica claimed that Drilon got PHP 311-M,Trillanes PHP 245-M while Pangilinan received PHP 395.84-M.Furthermore, he mentioned the alleged ghost projects by Drilon and Trillanes.In the last part of his post, Belgica told the Senators that they were no conscience for allegedly stealing public funds and he believed that the evidence that would prove that they were corrupt was strong.The post of Belgica went viral on the internet and shared by several pro-Duterte bloggers including Sass Rogando Sasot and Presidential Communications Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson.This is the whole post:DAP Big Boys!!!

Para malinaw, wala silang ebidensya at kaso at wala silang balak dalin ito sa korte. Simply, because they are NOT after the truth but only to shame and discredit SAP Bong. 1. Sinabi na ni former Navy FOIC Mercado at Sec Lorenzana na walang kinalaman si SAP doon. So wala ng paguusapan and a need for a Senate Investigation. CASE CLOSED. Latest Statement of Former Navy FOIC Ronald Joseph Mercado and published in the Manila Times on Jan 18, 2018 entitled: EX-NAVY CHIEF CLEARS BONG GO “Former Navy chief Ronald Joseph Mercado on Thursday defended Special Assistant to the President Christopher “Bong” Go, saying that the close aide of the President had nothing to do with the Philippine Navy’s frigate project.“Christopher ‘Bong’ Go never asked anything about the Philippine Navy’s P18 billion Frigate Acquisition Project,” Mercado said in a statement.“On my side, when I was flag officer in-command, we never once, with so many times we were together in many foreign Navy ships, and there was never an instance, not once, that he even asked me about the frigate. Never,” he said.“He never intervened, much more talk to me about these things,” he added. Mercado said he was “shocked” over news reports that “other personalities” were being dragged into the controversial Navy frigate project.He also denied that he received a letter inviting him to go to Malacañang to defend why he chose Thales Tacticos. 2.

"A lawyers’ group has expressed concern over Malacañang’s admission that a former counsel of President Rodrigo Duterte is a front-runner to replace retiring Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales.The National Union of People’s Lawyers (NUPL) said lawyer Edna Herrera Batacan’s emergence as one of the strong candidates to be the country’s next top graft buster “invites a lot of questions and concerns” on the issue of the aspirant’s independence.Ties that bind“Close professional, political and personal ties to the appointing power or any of its own circle and network undermine the trust and confidence in the credibility in the system of accountability and justice. Will the ties that bind not stand in the way?” said lawyer Edre Olalia, NUPL president.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said on Thursday he believed Batacan was a “front-runner” who enjoyed the trust and confidence of the President.A former Ombudsman prosecutor, Batacan, 65, represented the President when he was mayor of Davao City, and also acts as defense lawyer for the President’s son, former Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte.Such ties do not bode well for the country’s top graft buster, Olalia said.",1
"Can a “foundling” run for President?United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) interim secretary general JV Bautista said Sen. Grace Poe, apart from questions about her residency, could be disqualified from running for a higher office and even be unseated as a member of the Senate for not being a “natural-born Filipino.”Poe, an adopted daughter of the late movie actor Fernando Poe Jr. and actress Susan Roces, was abandoned in a church in Jaro, Iloilo province.Bautista brought up the question of Poe’s citizenship in a news forum in San Juan City a day after UNA interim president and Navotas Rep. Toby Tiangco claimed that Poe was not qualified to run for Vice President or President next year because she did not meet the 10-year residency requirement in the Constitution.“A foundling by definition is stateless,” Bautista said.Election lawyer Romulo Macalintal has said Poe is considered a Filipino and a natural-born citizen under the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.But Bautista said that the Philippines was not a signatory to the UN convention.“There are only acts of compliance by the Philippine government to the convention but we are not a signatory so it never cured the statelessness of a foundling,” Bautista said.Not an issueAccording to House Minority Leader Ronaldo Zamora, however, being a foundling is not an issue against Poe.“In the case of a foundling, it’s easy to say, ‘How do we know?’ But one rule of thumb is you cannot be a person who does not have a citizenship. You cannot be stateless. There are international conventions to that effect,” Zamora told House reporters, citing the Rohingya boat people.He noted that Poe “was found practically within hours of being born.”“How can you say she was a citizen of another country? The [baby was found still with its mother’s blood]. How can a foundling be stateless? What specific country is that? Clearly the Philippines. If she was not born here, how could she have arrived here?” Zamora asked.Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate said one question that could be raised was whether Poe could be considered a natural-born Filipino because there was no way to ascertain the citizenship of her parents.But the burden of proving that should fall on the accuser and not on Poe, Zarate said.Zamora agreed: “It’s not for Senator Poe to establish that, but for the one impugning her citizenship.”Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares said questioning Poe’s citizenship may not be politically correct.“From a political point of view, this is the worst issue you can raise. Foundlings also have rights. It’s as if they’re discriminating against foundlings,” Colmenares said.Quo warranto petitionAt the San Juan news forum, Bautista said Poe could lose her seat in the Senate if a petition for quo warranto is filed and if a court or the Senate electoral tribunal rules that she is not a natural-born Filipino.A quo warranto petition is a challenge to someone’s right to hold a certain office or position.“A natural born citizen according to the Constitution is a Filipino citizen who does not need to perform any act in order to perfect Philippine citizenship,” Bautista said.The Philippines follows the jus sanguinis principle of citizenship, he explained.“If your parents or one of them is a Filipino, then you are a Filipino by blood,” he added.Bautista explained that a foundling’s citizenship is hard to determine.“We have to follow the law. It may be harsh for a foundling but what can we do?” he said.In her May 2013 elections certificate of candidacy, Poe wrote that she was a “natural-born Filipino,” Bautista said.“The proper legal remedy for that for anyone who cares to question would be a petition for a quo warranto to question her occupancy of the office because somebody else might be entitled to that,” he said.Bautista said the candidate who ranked 13th in the 2013 senatorial election could be proclaimed duly elected senator because Poe was not qualified to run in the first place.Poe topped the senatorial election, polling more than 20 million votes.Asked why the issue was never taken up when Poe took office, Bautista said, “Perhaps nobody cared to raise it at that time.”“When you are occupying a position as lofty as the presidency and vice presidency, we should be scrutinizing carefully the qualifications,” he added",1
"On Wednesday, Rudy Giuliani accused Hillary Clinton of lying about her response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.The former New York City mayor and Trump supporter said: “I heard her say that she was there that day. I was there that day, I don’t remember seeing Hillary Clinton there. That was like when she said she had to run through gunfire. That turned out to be, what do we call it? A lie.”But then, a photographed surfaced showing Clinton walking next to Giuliani and then Governor George Pataki 24 hours after the attacks.But Giuliani stood by his accusation: “That lady in the photograph was Hillary body double,” he said.",0
"The Philippine National Police and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) on Tuesday said they had no evidence to back the allegations by presidential spokesperson Harry Roque and Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano that human rights groups could now be “unwitting tools” of drug lords.International and local human rights groups have denounced President Rodrigo Duterte’s ferocious war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed, either by police or by shadowy, unidentified masked gunmen.The Presidnets, who says he must be tough to protect the people from the scourge of drugs, has criticized human rights groups for “trivializing” his campaign and unjustly blaming the authorities for the bloodshed.“We have none right now,” the PNP spokesperson, Chief Supt. John Bulalacao, said when asked about proof of links between drug syndicates and human rights groups.“But as what has been mentioned by [the PDEA], we would continue to validate these reports that drug syndicates may be using human rights groups to discredit the efforts of the government,” Bulalacao said in a press briefing at Malacañang.PDEA spokesperson Derrick Carreon said the allegations that drug lords were using human rights groups to attack the government’s antidrug efforts were based on recent findings that would have to be investigated.“We still have to dig further on this,” Carreon said. “But seeing the trend of how they attack the antidrug campaign, we can only surmise it might be unwitting [on the part of the] human rights groups that they are being capitalized on or made as leverage by drug groups.”The PDEA and PNP are undertaking honest, well-planned efforts to beat the illegal drug scourge but continued to be attacked, he said.Carreon said the criticisms were attacks against the antidrug campaign, not just against the deaths resulting from the operations.Any attack against the campaign would be advantageous to the drug lords, he added.On Monday, Roque said drug lords could be funding some human rights groups to discredit the government.He insisted in another statement on Tuesday that the links between human rights groups and drug traffickers were possible.‘Unwitting tools’“We stand by the statement we made on the possibility that some nongovernment organizations, instead of assisting the government fulfill its human rights obligations, have become unwitting tools of drug lords,” Roque said in Tuesday’s statement.“Such scenario, we reiterate, should not be discounted given the billion-peso losses of the drug lords,” he added.Cayetano first aired the allegations on Sunday, saying some human rights groups have been “unwittingly used” by drug lords to counter the government’s war on drugs. “That’s the reality,” he said.Targets of death squadsThe New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Monday slammed the statements by Roque and Cayetano as “shockingly dangerous and shameful.”HRW urged both officials to withdraw their statements.“Are they trying to have death squads target human rights activists? Cayetano and Roque provide no evidence. They should withdraw their comments immediately,” HRW said in a statement.In response, Roque said HRW should “not feel alluded to, exaggerate and politicize the issue to get some media mileage and public attention.”Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate said Roque’s “reckless” statement “put the lives of our human rights advocates in grave danger.”“That was an irresponsible statement by Harry Roque, who, tragically, came from the human rights community. He’s dishing out statements without evidence and ruining people’s lives,” Zarate said.He said Roque’s “fake news” was meant to “divert attention from the fact that the administration’s bloody war on drugs is a failure.”‘Sad and ironic’“It is very sad and ironic that under this government it is the human rights advocates who are on the terrorist list, while drug lords are exonerated of their crimes and it is the poor that are being killed,” Zarate said, referring to the dismissal by state prosecutors of drug charges against the President’s wedding cosponsor and alleged drug lord Peter Lim and confessed drug dealer Kerwin Espinosa.The danger of “dispensing allegations without proof” was not lost on the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).“Rather than attacking human rights bodies and human rights defenders, we urge the government to display sincere commitment to transparency and the rule of law by allowing unhampered investigations to take place and show that perpetrators of human rights violations are brought to justice,” CHR spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia said.The allegations against the human rights groups followed a move by the government to declare more than 600 people terrorists for their alleged involvement in the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People’s Army.‘Tag incites violence’Cristina Palabay, secretary general of the human rights group Karapatan, said the hundreds petitioned for proscription included Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur on indigenous peoples’ rights, and 45 other human rights defenders and activists.Karapatan has written to Michael Frost, UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and Annalisa Ciampi, the special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, to decry the listing.“Mr. Duterte is sending out a warning, a threat that anyone who goes against his government will be immediately labeled a ‘terrorist,’ a tag that incites violence against individuals and justifies rights violations against them. The process of listing individuals is very arbitrary, malicious and highly irresponsible,” Palabay said.“Like the many ‘lists’ of past regimes, this serves the same purpose—to intimidate, harass, gag dissent, and force rights defenders into silence and submission,” she said.",1
"There’s a thin line between satire and fake news, so it just makes sense that The Adobo Chronicles and Rappler have agreed to merge.The Adobo Chronicles’ satire and Rappler’s fake news make the perfect combination that will bring news media to the 22nd Century.What’s more, news satire is not considered media by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), so the merged company will not be in violation of the Constitutional provision that media companies must be 100% Filipino owned.That means Omidyar Network and other interested foreign entities can invest in the merged company.Ladies and gentlemen, this is the future of media in the Philippines!",0
"President Rodrigo Duterte’s stand against same-sex marriages has been hailed by House Senior Deputy Minority Leader Lito Atienza.“President Duterte is correct in saying that same-sex marriages are not for us because we are a Catholic nation, aside from the legal aspect where the Civil Code provides for marriage between a man and a woman. Marriage should be for founding a family,” Atienza said on Tuesday.The lawmaker from Buhay party-list was reacting to the President’s statement during his meeting with the Filipino community in Myanmar over the weekend.“I respect the rights of two people sharing affection and material things but to allow them to get married by law is not okay. Same-sex couples can share affection even without marriage,” Atienza said.During the hearing of the House Committee on Women and Gender Equality, he had moved for removal of the phrase “of any other kind of license” from section 4E of the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) bill, saying this would have allowed the granting of a marriage license for same-sex couples.The amendment was accepted by the bill’s proponents.“The rights of every person are already guaranteed and protected by the Constitution and [are] something that we recognize and respect. But the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman must be upheld and protected as an institution as it is the most basic foundation of the family. I have always considered people belonging to the LGBT community as some of my best friends. In fact, I grew up with them belonging to one dance troupe. I know that many of them don’t approve of same-sex marriage. And I have always looked at the LGBT community with respect. But same-sex marriage is against the Constitution, existing laws and especially the natural law. We Filipinos should not really be copying Western culture. Even if they approve of it, majority of Filipinos don’t. It’s time Western countries look at us and start copying our culture,” Atienza said.",1
"A brief plea for help posted on YouTube on Wednesday night exposed cracks within the family behind the politically influential and formidable Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and what appears to be a power struggle within the century-old indigenous Christian group.On Thursday, in response to the post, INC expelled Cristina “Tenny” Villanueva Manalo and Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo, mother and younger brother of the group’s executive minister Eduardo V. Manalo, allegedly for trying to divide and seize power in the third-largest religious group in the Philippines.Eduardo is the first child of the late INC executive minister Eraño Manalo with Cristina “Tenny” Villanueva. Their other children are Felix Nathaniel, Marco Eraño, Lolita, Erlinda and Liberty.In July 2014, Eduardo led INC’s centennial anniversary celebration, with the unveiling of the 55,000-seat, $200-million Philippine Arena—declared the “largest mixed-use indoor theater” by Guinness World Records—in Ciudad de Victoria, Bocaue town in Bulacan province.What appeared to be a family feud became public on Thursday with the expulsion of Tenny and Angel. The expulsions came as INC prepared for its 101st anniversary on July 27.Marco Eraño Villanueva Manalo and Lolita “Lottie” Manalo Hemedez, brother and sister of Manalo, were also expelled, but it was not clear why.It was also not immediately clear what happened to them, but Tenny and Angel, on the 1-minute-55-second video they posted on YouTube on Wednesday night, appealed for help, saying their lives were “in danger.”Mother and son said there were threats to their lives and some ministers had been “taken.”‘Help us’“We are appealing to you because our lives are in danger. We hope that you can help us,” said Angel, who opened the video message.He introduced himself as the son of Ka Erdy (Eraño Manalo), who headed INC for 46 years until his death in August 2009. He is the younger brother of Eduardo, who took over the INC leadership after Eraño’s death.“I hope that you also listen to the appeal of my mother, Sister Tenny Manalo,” Angel said in Filipino.In her plea, Tenny gave scant but telling clues about who were behind the alleged threats to her and her son’s lives.“I’m appealing to our brethren in the church to help us because there is a threat to our very lives. Please help my children Angel and Lottie and their companions,” Tenny said.She called for help for at least 10 INC ministers “who were taken and until now have not yet been found.”“Let us show mercy to them and to their families,” she said.Her voice quivering, Tenny appealed to her eldest son: “And to my son Eduardo, I hope to talk to you.”No report to authoritiesShe ended with another call to INC followers: “Dear brethren, may the Lord God help us all. Many thanks to all of you.”Sought for comment on Thursday, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said the Manalos’ plea for help had not reached her office.“No such information or report,” De Lima said.The Philippine National Police said it was looking into allegations by some INC members that some ministers of the group had been kidnapped.Chief Supt. Wilben Mayor, spokesman for the PNP, said the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG)and the Quezon City Police District had been ordered to check out the allegations and the appeal for help by Tenny and Angel Manalo.“We are giving this due attention. The AKG and the QCPD are verifying the situation,” Mayor told reporters.Senior Supt. Roberto Fajardo, AKG chief, said his unit had not yet received reports about the kidnapping of INC ministers or of members of the Manalo family.He said his unit would take action once it received a complaint.Several INC followers gathered at the gate of the Manalo home on Tandang Sora Avenue, Quezon City, trying to find out what had happened to the expelled family members.‘Third party’Shirley and Roel Rosal, who were expelled from the group in June allegedly for trying to expose corruption involving INC ministers, said rumors of a schism in the Manalo family had been going around for a long time, but added that they believed the talk of division was being encouraged by a “third party” within the group’s administration.Shirley Rosal said she went to the Manalo home because she had seen the video and she was heeding calls for help on social media.She said she had seen a sign inside the house that read “hostage.”“There was a drone [a while ago] and there were people monitoring us,” she said.Supt. Ariel Capocao, chief of the Talipapa police station that has jurisdiction over the area, said no complaint had been received from the Manalo home.“They have internal security. If there’s any trouble, they would have already contacted me,” Capocao said.Water, electricity cutSarah Manuel, 34, one of the INC followers gathered at the gate of the Manalo home, said she had learned that the water and electricity to the family home had been cut.“We don’t want a fight. I saw the video last night where they were asking for help. Our initial reaction, as people who love the Iglesia, is we just want to help. We want to give them food and drink, and offer to bring them to their family elsewhere,” Manuel told reporters.“I don’t know what happened to them. I’ve always thought the Iglesia was doing fine. I don’t know what’s wrong. I just saw the video,” she said.‘Not true’Bienvenido Santiago, INC general evangelist, told a news conference on Thursday that Tenny and Angel were expelled for posting the video, claiming their lives were in danger and some ministers had been kidnapped.“Although it is painful for Brother Eduardo Manalo, the general leadership decided to expel those who are causing division in the Iglesia,” Santiago said.“They allege that some ministers have been kidnapped. They want to make it appear that Iglesia is involved. That’s not true,” he said.“Our reading of their message on YouTube last night is that they want to get the support of members who sympathize with them so they can get what they really want—to have a say in the running of the Iglesia,” he said.Not family corporation“All should know that Iglesia is not a family corporation. It is a religion that follows the teachings of God found in the Bible. Brother Eduardo Manalo and the general leadership cannot allow meddling by anyone,” he said.Santiago said Tenny and Angel tried to divide INC and the group applied its rules of discipline to them.–With reports from Jaymee T.

"Competing in a 50-kilometer marathon with 500 other runners from 12 different countries and making it through the finish line is awesome. But what's seriously awesome is being able to finish first without sports gear wearing and wearing skirts and sandals instead.That is what this 22-year-old Mexican woman Maria Lorena Ramirez did in April 29 when she participated in the female's 50-kilometer category of the Ultra Trail Cerrro Rojo. She totally put every runners to shame. No gears, no expensive branded running shoes, just skirts and a pair of sandals.The organizers recounts that Maria arrived at the starting point wearing a pair of simple sandals made of recycled fabric leather as soles with a hat and a handkerchief. She ran the length of the marathon in 7 hourse and 3 minutes hyrdating herself with only a bottle of water her hands.""She carried no special accessories. She didn't bring any gel, nor energy sweets, walking stick, glasses or those very expensive shoes that everyone wears to run in the mountains"", said Orlando Jimenez. Yes, that marathon is in the mountains with rough terrains. The answer why she didn't need any of those special accessories other runners would normally need is because she is a friggin' badass.When she's not owning races and marathons in skirts and sandals, Maria's job is herding goats and cattle. She walks 10-15 kilometers everyday to attend to the herd. And yes, I just implied that this is not the first time she triumphed in race. Just last year, she took the second place at 100-kilometer category of the Caballo Blanco Ultramarathon in Chihuahua.Here's a video of the Ultra Trail Cerro Rojo where Maria participated where she won first place:",0
"The plunder case filed by Senator Antonio Trillanes IV against President Rodrigo Duterte has already been closed and terminated, Solicitor General Jose Calida said Tuesday.Calida was referring to the plunder case filed by Trillanes against Duterte in May 2016 over allegations of the former Davao City mayor’s unexplained wealth and undeclared bank accounts.The Solicitor General said he inquired from the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), through a letter dated Feb. 8, the status of the criminal complaint filed by Trillanes on May 5, 2016 which accused Duterte of maintaining ghost employees in Davao City that could have funded the latter’s PHP2.4 billion worth of deposits.“I received a letter from [Overall Deputy Ombudsman Melchor Arthur] Carandang stating that the investigation has already been closed and terminated. The recommendation to terminate was approved by Deputy Ombudsman Cyril Ramos on 29 November 2017,” Calida said, citing the reply he received from the Office of the Ombudsman on the matter.It can be recalled Carandang has been suspended by Malacanang over unauthorized disclosures of Duterte’s alleged bank accounts.Calida questioned the decision of Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales to withhold from the public the status of the case.“A public officer must be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, and efficiency,” Calida told reporters during the press conference.“Ombudsman Carpio-Morales, being the Ombudsman, must be the protector of the people. She has the constitutional duty to publicize matters covered by investigations when the circumstances so warrant and with due prudence,” he noted.“This case involves the President of the Republic of the Philippines. Why are you withholding this information? When this case was filed, a press conference was even conducted. Three months after the termination of the case, the public has still no knowledge that the evidence supporting the allegations of Trillanes is without merit,” he explained.“If the case, in the magnitude like this, when the President of the Philippines is the respondent and the case was dismissed by the Office of the Ombudsman, why will not disclose it to the public? Are they also cuddling the complainant, Senator Trillanes?” Calida asked.Calida said “Senator Trillanes who is always badgering the President about this. Now, what can you say now? His evidence was junked, and because it is junked, it is another word for garbage.”The government’s top lawyer also said the Senate should stop the hearing about Duterte’s unexplained wealth and undeclared bank accounts considering it is based on the complaint filed before the OMB.“Knowing that this frivolous case was terminated by the Ombudsman, Sen. Trillanes now seeks to have another Senate hearing on the matter to convince the public about his garbage junked by the Ombudsman,” Calida said.“The Senate should stop this non-sense investigation.” he urged.Meanwhile, Calida said that he would inform President Duterte on the matter through a formal letter.What do you think on this? Leave your comments below",0
Trillanes faces controversy after he turned off the microphone Senator Alan Peter Cayetano during the hearing on Extra Judicial Killings.

"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been directed by the country’s privacy watchdog to cooperate with an investigation of the improper sharing of the personal information of more than 1 million Filipino users of the social media platform with the British political consulting company Cambridge Analytica.In an April 11 letter to Zuckerberg made public on Friday, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) said the investigation was intended “to determine whether there is unauthorized processing of personal data of Filipinos, and other possible violations of the Data Privacy Act.”The NPC’s move followed a decision by EU privacy watchdogs to look deeper into the harvesting of personal data from social networks for economic or political purposes.Outside the United States, the Philippines had the largest amount of user data acquired by Cambridge Analytica, with 1.18 million accounts in the country affected, according to the NPC.“As the Philippine data privacy authority, we are directing you to furnish this commission with information relevant to the processing of Facebook data of affected Filipinos, and how personal data is generally shared with third parties using your platform,” the NPC told Zuckerberg.“Submit to us the documents required within 15 days from receipt. The failure on your end to comply with these requirements will prompt us to take further corrective actions to protect the interests of Filipino data subjects,” the letter said.‘Improperly shared’The letter was signed by NPC Commissioner Raymund Liboro and his two deputies.It did not specify what actions the NPC would take if the documents were not submitted.The watchdog sought documentation on the actions taken by Facebook when it discovered the unauthorized processing of user data.Private data from about 87 million Facebook users worldwide was “improperly shared” by Cambridge Analytica through software developed by data scientist Aleksandr Kogan.The NPC noted that Kogan was required by Facebook to destroy the data that were collected and processed outside its terms of service and that Cambridge Analytica’s data science officer had confirmed the information was destroyed.“Kindly submit documentation between Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, and any evidence which led Facebook to believe that the data had indeed been destroyed, as well as any documentation of the extent of information shared between Facebook and Dr. Kogan, and from Dr. Kogan to Cambridge Analytica,” it added.A Facebook spokesperson said the company was committed to protecting people’s information and is engaged with the Philippines’ privacy watchdog.“We’ve recently made significant updates to make our privacy tools easier to find, restrict data access on Facebook, and make our terms and data policy clearer,” Facebook said.Recent research has shown Filipinos to be among the most active social media users in the world, spending on average more than four hours a day on platforms like Facebook.Cambridge Analytica has counted US President Donald Trump’s election campaign among its clients.A Hong Kong newspaper has said several people involved in President Duterte’s 2016 election campaign had met in 2015 with Alexander Nix, the now-suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica.Those people said the meeting with Nix was during a lunch break at an information technology seminar in Manila and there has been no contact since.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque on Tuesday said that Mr. Duterte’s election campaign did not rely on information bought from anybody, nor did it hire Cambridge Analytica’s services.Duterte campaignReturning from his trip to China on Thursday, Mr. Duterte dismissed reports that his campaign may have benefited from the Facebook data.“I had no Cambridge, Cambridge … All that I had was just a simple campaign,” Mr. Duterte said.He said that during a massive rally in Luneta days before the elections, he asked those who believe in God, in the priests and those against killing drug offenders not vote for him.“Then I said, ‘Those who want to go to hell and kill the druggies, vote for me.’ See what happened,” he said.“Also why would I pay that stupid Cambridge to run my campaign? The more I’ll lose,” he added.",1
"Senate’s Majority Floor Leader Tito Sotto revealed how much money did the Philippines contributed to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as its member last year.According to Sotto, the Philippines contributed millions of pesos to the ICC.He believed that the money contributed by the country was one of the reason why the ICC is trying to convince the government to retract the witdrawal.“Our last payment to ICC was € 397,896 (euros) or php 25,404,938.

"Moving swiftly, the Supreme Court announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to hear the petition of seven opposition lawmakers questioning the constitutionality of President Duterte’s declaration of martial law in Mindanao.The court set a three-day oral argument—June 13 to 15—on the petition filed on Monday by the lawmakers, led by Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, and directed the Office of the Solicitor General to file a comment on the case.Named respondents in the petition were Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and the Armed Forces of the Philippine chief of staff, Gen. Eduardo Año.Lawyers’ petitionIn a related move on Tuesday, a group of lawyers petitioned the high tribunal to compel the House of Representatives and the Senate to hold a joint session to review Mr. Duterte’s martial law proclamation and suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus following the May 23 attack by Maute terrorists on Marawi City.“This is a rule of law petition. What we’re asking for is compliance with the minimum procedural fidelity with the Constitution,” former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay, the counsel of the petitioners, said in a news conference.“The language of the Constitution requires it. It’s a mandatory requirement,” Hilbay stressed. “It’s very clear that the intention is for the Congress to perform a legislative review of the declaration of martial law.”He said more than 300 lawyers joined the petition for mandamus, including detained Sen. Leila de Lima, former Sen. Rene Saguisag, former Commission on Elections Chair Christian Monsod, and former Commission on Human Rights Chair Etta Rosales.Congressional reviewNamed respondents in the 23-page petition were Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III and House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez.The lawyers said the congressional review of Mr. Duterte’s declaration was “meant to prevent abuse of power and to ensure popular mandate in the exercise of the President’s martial law powers.”They said the lawmakers “unlawfully neglected” their constitutional duty to convene and tackle the issues in connection with the martial law declaration and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.Constitutional dutySection 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution states, “The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President.”The petitioners argued that the passage of the Senate and House resolutions supporting Mr. Duterte’s decision was not enough to comply with their constitutional duty.“These acts cannot be considered compliance with the clear constitutional requirement for Congress to convene and vote jointly,” they said.“The failure of Congress to act as a single deliberative body cannot be substituted with separate resolutions passed by both (the House and the Senate) … Substantial compliance is no compliance,” they insisted.The lawyers warned that “any institutional shortcut, while politically expedient, sets the dangerous precedent of allowing a total disregard of a clear mandatory obligation by the Constitution.”Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III welcomed the filing of the petitions in the Supreme Court.“If there are differing interpretations of a constitutional provision, then the Supreme Court should step in as the referee. Let us be guided by the Supreme Court pronouncement on the issue,” Pimentel said in a text message.",1
"Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indonesian President Joko Widodo will not attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ meeting in Manila next week.According to the Russian news agency RBC, Putin suddenly refused to participate in the APEC summit in the Philippines but will send Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instead.Meanwhile, during the press briefing at the International Media Center on Thursday afternoon, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Laura del Rosario confirmed Widodo’s absence from APEC.“I just got a verbal message that there are things in Jakarta that need the attention of Pres. Widodo,” Del Rosario said, citing domestic concerns as reason for Widodo’s sudden non-attendance.Widodo will be represented by Indonesian Trade Minister Thomas Lembong.Although the Russian and Indonesian govenments did not give specific reasons for their heads of state’s decision to skip the Manila summit, many are speculating that Putin and Widodo are scared of being victimized by the laglag bala extortion scheme at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.President Aquino expressed frustration especially over Putin’s decision since the Manila government even set aside an exclusive lane for the Russian leader along EDSA (Metro Manila’s main thoroughfare) so that he does not encounter any traffic to and from the meeting site.",0
"“The policemen were asking for P50,000 for the release of my son from jail,” a grieving mother told the Inquirer on Thursday.Elena Dechavez said she could raise only P7,000, to which she added P3,500 that her son, Alvin Ronald, had when he was arrested in Navotas City on drug charges a few months ago.“I gave them the money but they still killed my son,” said Dechavez, who openly wept at a gathering called “Holy Eucharistic Mass Action Against Extrajudicial Killings,” held at Our Lady of Victory Chapel in Potrero village in Malabon City.Dechavez said she went to the police station to complain about what happened to her son. She said the cops just returned the money to her.‘War on the poor’Dechavez spoke to the Inquirer a day after London-based Amnesty International released its report on its investigation of the extrajudicial killings in President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, accusing the Philippine National Police of paying officers and assassins to kill alleged drug offenders, planting evidence and setting up a racket with funeral homes in a “murderous war on the poor.”More than 7,000 suspects have been killed by police and unknown assailants since Mr. Duterte launched the crackdown seven months ago.Amnesty warned that the killings could constitute crimes against humanity and urged the Duterte administration to investigate the murders and punish the policemen involved.The PNP denied the allegations and Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II brushed aside Amnesty’s findings, saying criminals were not human.She lost 2 sonsAnother mother from Navotas, Maria Mesa de Parine, told the Inquirer that she lost two sons—Aljun and Danilo—four days apart—in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs.Rolando Paredes of Caloocan City told the Inquirer that his son, Rolando Jr., a scavenger who had no means or reason to use drugs, was killed two weeks ago by still unidentified gunmen in Tondo, Manila, in a case of “mistaken identity.”The gunmen’s real target, he said, was a certain Reynaldo Gutierrez, the name given by police to the funeral parlor where the body of his son was taken.The three parents joined more than 200 relatives of 70 victims of extrajudicial killings from Malabon, Navotas, Payatas and Bagong Silangan in Quezon City, and Bagong Silang in Caloocan, at the gathering, which began with a Mass concelebrated by Caloocan Bishop Deogracias Iñiguez and 15 priests.Church initiativeThe Mass marks the first time the Catholic Church has gathered a big number of families of victims to publicly condemn the extrajudicial killings in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs.“There was a previous initiative by Father Nonong (Fajardo) in Adamson University,” said Fr. Joselito Sarabia, director of St. Vincent Seminary in Tandang Sora, Quezon City, and one of the organizers of Thursday’s event in Malabon.“We are continuing that initiative, with the help of friends, benefactors and other lay people here and in other countries like France, the US, and Papua New Guinea,” he said.Fajardo, director of the extension program of Adamson University, said the initiative began in July last year, “when the number of deaths was about 1,000. We had Mass for the victims.”Reaffirmation of supportHe said the Church continued condoling with the families of the victims, and then schools started issuing statements condemning the killings, followed by more Masses and photos of the killings exhibited on the premises of the Redemptorist Church in Baclaran, Parañaque City.The gathering in Malabon on Thursday was for reaffirmation of support for the families of the victims, Fajardo said.“When these families meet here, they talk to each other and their fears are somehow alleviated. They also feel that the community cares for them and their situation,” he said.Those who had been killed left behind children, “like this 5-year-old kid,” Fajardo said, pointing to a child at the gathering. “Who will send him to school and look after his needs? So if, say, five men with their own families are killed, at least five or more children will suffer.”The gatherings move the community to pitch in to raise money to support the children, he said.Fajardo reiterated the need for the Church and the community to unite and help each other, and allow the families to narrate their experiences and voice out their fears during the gatherings.Families threatenedHe said the perpetrators, after killing the victims, warned the families not to say a word or they, too, would be killed.“There were times when these perpetrators, despite wearing [balaclavas], were recognized by the victims’ families,” Fajardo said.“I’m glad that the families are now finally coming out to speak,” he added.Many of the families are under the care of the Vincentian congregation.“It had to take the murder of a Korean for this drug war to stop,” Fajardo said, referring to the kidnapping for ransom and murder of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo by policemen inside PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, on Oct. 18 last year.“But the 7,000 Filipinos killed seemed to be ignored because they were all poor. Now the [military] is being asked to police the police. If they clash, what would happen next?” he said.",1
" to Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Camarines Sur, Albay. There was a rail service to the north that went as far as Damortis, Pangasinan, where buses transported passengers up to Baguio City via Kennon Road.Over the years, rail transport gave way to road transport. Railroad links to various parts of Luzon were abandoned. But the idea of reviving the railroad network grew, especially during the Fidel Ramos administration in 1992-1998, driven by the need to decongest Metro Manila and develop the provinces around Metro Manila. Northrail was incorporated in 1995 as a subsidiary to the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA).An agreement was drawn up by Northrail with the China National Machinery Industry Corp. (Sinomach) during the Gloria Macapagal Arroyo administration (2001-2010) but the succeeding administration of Benigno S. Aquino III (2010-2016) terminated the contract over legal questions. Sinomach sued the Philippines, claiming over $100 million in damages and costs.Last Tuesday, Secretary Arthur Tugade of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) announced that the government and Sinomach had finally settled their dispute, saving the over $100-million claim for damages and hundreds of millions of pesos in legal fees and arbitration costs. The agreement was signed in the presence of Secretary of Foreign Affairs Alan Peter Cayetano and Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jian Hua.The railway to the north will now proceed as Philippine National Railways (PNR) North 2 from Tutuban to Malolos and then to Clark at a cost of P150 billion. Work may begin as early as the end of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018, Secretary Tugade said. It will thus be the beginning project of the massive infrastructure program of the Duterte administration known as “Build, Build, Build.”",1
"Sen. Francis Escudero on Monday said politicians should stay away from the investigation of the $81-million money-laundering scandal as their participation could bring more harm than good.“Today is election season and many senators, especially those running [for reelection] are joining the investigation. We (Poe’s camp) have not dipped our fingers into it because we believe that we should not wash our dirty linen in public,” Escudero told reporters here.The Senate blue ribbon committee is looking into the $81 million stolen by hackers from the account of the Bangladesh central bank in the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The funds were sent to Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., deposited in five accounts, converted into pesos, transferred into casinos and finally moved out of the Philippines.Investigators don’t know where the funds went overseas.The blue ribbon committee is chaired by Sen. Teofisto Guingona III, a reelectionist.Other reelectionist senators who took part in the two hearings the committee on the money-laundering case recently conducted so far were Senators Sergio Osmeña III, Ralph Recto and Vicente Sotto III.Escudero, running mate of Sen. Grace Poe, said the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) were capable of conducting the investigation, which is why politicians should stay away from it.“The central bank and AMLC should be left to investigate the issue on their own because I believe they can do it right. I also don’t believe that we should make the investigation public, that we should point at how weak our banking system is (before the public) because our credit rating and standing in the global financial community will be affected,” he said.Escudero noted that in other countries, similar scandals also happened but investigations were not made public because they really affected one country’s reputation.If other politicians could not help it, they have to be careful and think of what the repercussions would be, said the vice presidential candidate.“I hope that in the coming days, the central bank, the Senate and the AMLC would be more circumspect in their pronouncements because it will not only make our banking industry suffer but our overseas workers as well. Remittance fees could increase,” Escudero said.“Our reputation is at stake here,” he added.",1
"Thousands of workers and activists marched in a May Day rally in Manila and other cities on Tuesday in protest against what they said was President Rodrigo Duterte’s failure to keep a campaign promise to get rid of a labor contractualization scheme.The rallies were peaceful, but the Malacañang complex was locked down, initially denying journalists’ access as protesters burned the President’s effigy with a sign “Liar King” several hundred meters away.A pledge to act against employers who hire workers for short-term employment without adequate benefits helped President Duterte win the presidency in 2016.Shortly after assuming power, the President warned that businesses would face closure if they failed to stop hiring under a scheme called end of contract, or “endo.”Under the scheme, a worker would be dismissed before he could serve a full six months, denying him the right to become a regular employee with full benefits.Trade unions say the practice has persisted, particularly in shopping malls and the fast-food industry.Labor groups uniteRenato Reyes Jr., secretary general of the left-wing alliance Bayan, said the President had done what other leaders had failed to do in 30 years—unite fragmented labor groups.“The historic unity of the working class is the direct result of the failure of the regime to bring an end to contractualization, a major campaign promise of the President,” Reyes said in a statement.About 8,000 police and soldiers kept watch at the protest march on Malacañang.Police estimated up to 7,000 people, waving flags and carrying banners, took part in the protest in Manila.More than 9,500 protesters joined the Labor Day rallies in Cebu, Bacolod, Iloilo and other major cities in the Visayas, demanding not just an end to endo but also higher wages and more jobs.In Cebu City, the President signed an executive order (EO) prohibiting illegal contracting or subcontracting and asked the labor department to submit a list of companies “engaged in or suspected to be engaged in labor-only contraction.”He asked Congress to pass a law amending the “outdated” Labor Code “to keep it attuned to the realities of our time.”“I remain firm in my commitment to put an end to endo and illegal contractualization,” the President said. “A mere executive order is not enough. I cannot be a legislator. It is not allowed. But I can only implement.”Tacloban City rallyJosephine Jaballa, who joined the Labor Day rally in Tacloban City, appealed to the administration to stop contractualization “because aside from the possibility that we will be separated from our works after five months, we are not enjoying benefits entitled to regular workers.”Jaballa, 42, was among 25 former employees of a poultry farm in Albuera, Leyte, who lost their jobs after their contract ended in January.In Angeles City, Pampanga, Primo Amparo, national campaign officer of Workers for People’s Liberation, said the new EO did not ban subcontracting.“It did not prohibit the existence of manpower agencies that facilitate the contractualization of labor,” Amparo said.Around 500 workers from Bataan and Pampanga joined the rally at Plaza Miranda in Angeles City.Baguio CityIn Baguio City, 150 teachers, jeepney drivers, health workers and students marched on Session Road to protest contractualization.Workers belonging to Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), its allies and other labor groups mobilized thousands more in rallies in Luzon and Mindanao, including about 3,000 in Davao City, where Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio provided tents as makeshift day care centers for the children of protesters.Organizers reported rallies in the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Masbate, Albay, Sorsogon, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Sur and Misamis Occidental.They also reported that authorities either delayed or blocked protesters on their way to rally sites.In Bataan province, police stopped a group of workers from the Bataan free port in Hermosa town, saying the jeepneys they were using were “out of line” and violating their franchises in transporting the protesters who were headed to Pampanga.Compostela ValleyKMU reported that 600 farmworkers aboard nine buses from Compostela Valley province who were held at a checkpoint on the highway to Davao City staged a rally instead in Nabunturan town where they were stopped.Chief Insp. Milgrace Driz, spokesperson for the Southern Mindanao police, said the passengers of the buses were not held because they were protesters.Driz said police just needed to verify whether vehicles and drivers heading to Davao City were properly documented",1

"PressePope Francis on Sunday, February 19, urged leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo to act quickly to resolve its political crisis and curb violence, condemning in particular the use of child soldiers.Violence has flared across the country in recent months, including deadly confrontations in the Kasai regions, as President Joseph Kabila has indicated no plans to step down even though his term ended in December.On Friday, a video emerged appearing to show DR Congo soldiers killing unarmed civilians in Kasai-Oriental, while on Saturday officials said militiamen from the country’s Nande ethnic group had killed 25 civilians in the country’s violence-torn east, most hacked to death with machetes.“We continue to hear news sadly of violent and brutal clashes in the Kasai-Central region of the Democratic Republic of Congo,” Francis said during his Angelus address in Saint Peter’s Square.“I strongly feel the pain of the victims, especially the many children ripped from their families and from schools to be used as soldiers,” he said.He made “an urgent appeal” to “national authorities and the international community, so that they take appropriate and prompt decisions” to end the violence.Hundreds have died in central Congo in recent months and tens of thousands have been forced to flee as battles rage between security forces and militias.Kabila, in power since 2001, was to step down on December 20 at the end of his second and final term, but refused to do so.A deal brokered by the country’s influential Roman Catholic bishops allows him to stay in office until late 2017 in tandem with a transitional body and a new premier.But efforts to avoid all-out conflict in the country of 71 million people appear to have broken down, negotiations between the government and opposition parties having stalled.Francis, 80, also urged prayers for victims of war and violence in other parts of Africa and across the world.He denounced in particular the “cruel terrorist acts” in Pakistan, where at least 88 people were killed on Thursday when an attacker blew himself up inside a crowded Sufi shrine, for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility.The attack came after a series of bloody assaults, including a Taliban suicide bomb in the eastern city of Lahore which killed 13 people and wounded dozens.",1

"Even before the polls closed on Monday afternoon, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte offered “reconciliation and healing” to his rivals in the race for Malacañang, which he appeared to have won.Duterte was leading his rivals Sen. Grace Poe, Mar Roxas, Vice President Jejomar Binay and Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago by a wide margin in the early count of the presidential vote.The vice presidential race was seen as a head-to-head contest between Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. and the administration’s Leni Robredo.As of 9:36 p.m., the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos had 10,661,930 votes and Robredo, 9,771,606 votes.“I would like to reach my hand to my opponents. Let us begin the healing of the land,” Duterte said in a talk with reporters immediately after he voted at Daniel Aguinaldo High School in Matina District here.He said his offer of healing covered “everyone,” including his main tormentor, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, a vice presidential candidate who accused him of concealing millions of pesos in undisclosed bank accounts and sued him in the Office of the Ombudsman, alleging that he charged for 11,000 nonexistent employees of the Davao municipal government as the campaign drew to a close last week.Duterte described the attacks during the campaign as “virulent,” causing the candidates pain, especially those who were hit with what he called “black propaganda.”“If you don’t accept the goodwill, that is fine,” Duterte said, slipping back to the thuggish posture that he used to portray himself as a trash-talking, antiestablishment politician to capture the admiration of millions of ordinary voters, who abandoned the leading candidates and put him at the head of the race in the last few days of the campaign.Rivals alarmedHis promises to kill tens of thousands of suspected criminals outside the justice system, abolish Congress and declare a revolutionary government if lawmakers refuse to back his policies or move for his impeachment if found guilty of mass murder have alarmed rivals, who warned that he was a dictator in the making.Duterte’s expletive-laden speeches, including a talk with reporters in which he called the Pope a “son of a bitch,” and insensitive talk, such as joking at a campaign rally that he had wanted to have been the first to rape an Australian missionary who was gang-raped and murdered in a jailhouse riot in Davao in 1989, did not dent his popularity but instead seemed to have made him more popular to voters.As the vote came on Monday, it was clear that he was the man to beat in the race for the presidency and in the early count of the vote, he appeared to be headed toward a landslide.As of 9:36 p.m., Duterte, the standard-bearer of PDP-Laban (Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan) had received 11,593,428 votes, nearly twice the votes of the runner-up, Sen. Grace Poe, who had 6,576,600 votes.His votes so far were from the Luzon provinces of Abra, La Union, Pampanga, Quezon and Laguna, and Cebu, Leyte, Biliran and Bohol in the Visayas.As expected, Duterte was dominating the election in Mindanao, including his bailiwick Davao del Norte and Davao del Sur, Agusan del Norte, Surigao del Sur, the Lanao provinces, Maguindanao, Sarangani, South Cotabato and Sulu.As of 8:30 p.m., administration candidate Roxas was in third place with 6,177,430 votes.Vice President Jejomar Binay, who had been banking on a come-from-behind victory, had received 3,755,745 votes, roughly just a third of Duterte’s votes.Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago was in the fifth place, barely breaking through the million mark with 1,150,924 votes.It was her third attempt to win the presidency.The Inquirer’s partial and unofficial tally is based on data transmitted to the Commission on Elections’ transparency server at the Pope Pius XII Catholic Center in Manila.The Inquirer is among a handful of news organizations given access to real-time results.The figures accounted for 18,823,706 votes, or 33.77 percent of the total, covering 37,758 precincts.In the vice presidential race, Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano, Duterte’s running mate, was a far third with 3,889525 votes, but overtaking independent candidate Sen. Francis “Chiz” Escudero, Poe’s running mate, who had 3,278,147 votes.Senators Antonio Trillanes IV and Gregorio “Gringo” Honasan II, both bottom-dwellers in the polls, remained consistently in the last two spots: Trillanes had 552,266 votes, while Honasan had 481,102 votes.PPCRV countIn the unofficial count of the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) as of 9:10 p.m., Duterte was pulling farther away from his rivals in the presidential race after 67 percent of clustered precincts had been counted.Marcos had a narrow lead over Robredo in the race for the vice presidency.In the race for Malacañang, Duterte had 11,436,893 votes, with nearly a 5-million-vote lead over Poe, who had with 6,491441. Roxas was third, with 6,407,237.Binay was fourth with 3,872,413 votes, followed by Santiago with 1,174,924 and the late Roy Señeres with 16,344.Marcos led the contest for the vice presidency with 10,535,821 votes, followed by Robredo with 9,627,377.In third place was Cayetano with 4,015,573, and Escudero was fourth with 3,380,048.Trillanes got 571,560 and Honasan 498,375.",1
"fighting was from floor to floor. One day the Americans would conquer the floor but next day they would be removed. It was bloody.Then followed the massacre of Ermita, Malate, and Paco districts. As people came out of their houses because of fire, Japanese soldiers shot them or if they would just bayonet them to save on bullets. They did the same in the buildings of De La Salle College. Besides the Christian Brothers who were mostly Germans, many Filipino families who took refuge there were murdered. One of the brothers was able to crawl under an altar where he hid for three days sucking his own blood until relief came.For weeks the area smelled of dead bodies. I saw a dead Japanese soldier being swung into the fire. A couple of weeks later someone informed us that a daughter of Dr. Potenciano, family friend, was in San Lazaro Hospital.

"The Office of the Ombudsman has found sufficient basis to file plunder and bribery charges against resigned Bureau of Immigration (BI) Associate Commissioners Al Argosino and Michael Robles over the alleged attempt to extort P50 million from a gaming tycoon in November last year.Argosino and Robles, fraternity brothers of President Duterte, were accused of demanding the payoff from Macau-based businessman Jack Lam in exchange for the release of 1,316 detained Chinese nationals who worked for him without proper visas.The Ombudsman’s order, made public on Friday, came despite concerns from some senators that the loss of a measly P1,000 from the recovered “dirty money” would prevent the case from reaching the P50-million threshold required for a plunder conviction.The resolution stated that while the amount surrendered by Argosino and Robles to the Department of Justice (DOJ) came slightly short, it “cannot excuse them from being indicted for plunder.”This was because they still failed to rebut the statement of Lam’s business associates, Norman Ng and Alex Yu, who claimed the BI officials received P50 million from Lam at City of Dreams hotel and casino complex on Nov. 27, 2016.Robles himself admitted that “they took possession of all five bags containing the P50 million.”The Ombudsman also did not give credence to their claim that they merely took custody of the money for safekeeping, to be used later as evidence in an investigation on illegal online gambling.The Ombudsman resolution was served on the respondents on Friday.It noted that Argosino and Robles even gave P2 million to alleged middleman Wenceslao Sombero Jr. and kept the remaining money from Nov. 27 to Dec. 8, instead of turning it over to the proper authorities.“Their failure to immediately report to the proper investigating authority, or at the very least, their superiors, (DOJ) Secretary (Vitaliano) Aguirre and Commissioner (Jaime) Morente, that they had custody of the P50 million, contradicts their professed intentions,” the Ombudsman said.P18-million cutThe former associate commissioners allegedly gave an P18-million cut to BI intelligence chief Charles Calima on Dec. 9, which the Ombudsman considered to be “all acts of ownership, which showed that they treated the P50 million that they received as their own.”According to the Ombudsman, Argosino and Robles used their official functions to commit the crimes with Sombero acting as a conspirator.The antigraft body found Sombero’s role to be crucial to the scheme since his actions in his capacity as president of the Asian Gaming Service Providers Association Inc. paved the way for the transaction.Meanwhile, Calima was held liable for taking part in the extortion scheme allegedly in exchange for keeping his silence.Argosino and Robles face one count each of the nonbailable offense of plunder, as well as direct bribery and violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for causing undue injury to the government.They also face two counts of violating Presidential Decree No. 46, which prohibits government employees from receiving gifts.Probable causeDespite filing one of the complaints against the BI officials before the Ombudsman in December, Sombero still faces one count each of plunder, direct bribery and graft, and two counts of violating PD 46.The Ombudsman likewise found probable cause to charge Sombero with one count of direct bribery and graft.As the source of the bribe money, Lam would be charged with one count of violating PD 46 for sending the gift to Argosino and Robles.The controversy erupted after Robles and Argosino were caught on closed-circuit television receiving five paper bags purportedly containing P10 million each in the hotel-casino.",1

"DEFENSE Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Sunday blasted the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) for claiming that the United States was behind the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) attack on Bohol last week that left 14 people dead including a leader of the terrorist group and four government troops.“The CPP, as before, has become delusional and can no longer distinguish between what is fact and what is fantasy,” Lorenzana said in a statement.The CPP also questioned statements issued by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and called the military operations “overkill.”“The Philippine Air Force dropped nine bombs in Barangay Napo, Calenti and Banahao in Inabangan forcing at least 1,200 local residents people to evacuate,” it said.“The AFP media office, known for spinning fake news stories, has produced a highly dubious story of no less than 60 fully armed men who traveled three hundred kilometers by boat from Sulu to Bohol, unhampered by the whole AFP establishment, then upstream to a place unknown to them with only a general plan to ‘target tourists,’” the CPP added.But the Defense chief said the group has become a victim of its own propagandizing and has rendered itself inutile and an unreliable source of the truth.“It is not and has never been credible. Definitely, transparency is not a value they have. Just like the Plaza Miranda bombing which they hatched, executed, denied, and eventually admitted, the CPP is likely to create scenarios and will pass off these lies as the truth in order to push its selfish, anti-people and anti-government motives, such as extortion, kidnapping and intimidation,” Lorenzana noted.He said if there is a fake organization composed of individuals pretending to be patriots and nationalists-, it is these “communist terrorists.”On Tuesday, government forces clashed with heavily armed members of the ASG spotted in a town in Bohol on Tuesday, a day after security officials confirmed the existence of a terror threat in Central Visayas.The officials said the fighting erupted in the village of Ilaya in Inabanga town where civilians reported to the police the presence of Abu Sayyaf bandits who arrived in several speedboats.The firefight occurred two days after the United States Embassy in Manila issued a travel advisory warning its citizens against travelling to Cebu and Bohol because of the threat of kidnapping.Intelligence reports said the armed men were led by ASG sub-leader Muammar Askali alias Abu Rami, whose group was initially monitored in Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte.The terrorists reached Inabanga on Monday night.The military confirmed that Askali was among the attackers killed in the clash.",1
"Luningning Tan-Gatue, 86, has kept the Philippine flag flying for decades.Flag-making is her family’s business. And the period leading up to Independence Day is extremely busy for her.Granddaughter Addrianne Marie goes over the orders, which could come in the “hundreds of thousands” during the “peak season” from mid-May to June 12. Addrianne’s twin, Addrielle Ann, takes charge of the payroll and other administrative matters.The twin’s mother, Carmelita, makes sure the orders are ready for pick up. Quality control is her forte. Her husband, Gregory II, oversees the needleworkers and cutters who work at the back of their cramped store on Rizal Avenue Extension in Santa Cruz, Manila.Family emblemThe hubbub at the front store, and the nonstop whirring of high-speed sewing machines at the backroom means business is good. Add to the tumult the sound of metal against metal as a worker installs eyelets on every finished flag. The cord that goes through the eyelets will keep the flag attached to the pole as the 1-meter-by-2-meter tricolor flutters against the wind.Luningning, who comes from Laguna, has a keen sense of business she acquired from her husband, Gregorio Tan-Gatue. She has kept the family emblem as First Family of Philippine Flags soaring for decades.“The secret is hard work, and to make sure the business stays in the family,” she said. “You can start from scratch, but if you work hard, you will reap the fruits of your labor.”According to Gregory, the Tan-Gatue flag-making business started around 1910. His great-grandfather, Alejandro Tan-Gaute, a Chinese, went into business supplying linen to the US troops.But the troops also needed the US flag, and Tan-Gatue, an entrepreneur, ventured into making flags and emblems, with the help of the US officer who provided him with the specifics.When the Commonwealth government was created, a Philippine tricolor was needed to fly beside the star-spangled banner. Again, Tan-Gatue was commissioned to mass produce the item.When the US flag was finally lowered, and the Philippine flag raised to fly alone, signifying the country’s independence from the United States during ceremonies at Luneta on July 4, 1946, the Tan-Gatues hold the distinction of having sewn both flags.Today, the Tan-Gatues flag-making business remains in the hands of cousins. Luningning’s Super Atlas Flag competes with International Flag House and Global Flags, which are owned by the brothers of her late husband.Addrienne and Addrielle, both graduates of De La Salle University, belong to the fifth-generation Tan-Gatues being groomed for the business.Business side of sewingWhile the twins know and understand the process from cutting to sewing, they are more inclined to do the business side. Addrienne has a degree in business management, while Addrielle finished marketing.Still, the same love for the business seems ingrained in the two girls. Like their grandmother and parents, the twins also spend their days at the Super Atlas Flag store in Santa Cruz.Today, the most popular flags are made of nylon, which usually lasts from three to six months, depending on the weather, according to Luningning.“Nylon is lighter, so you can see they flutter nicely,” Luningning explained.Top clientFlags that are displayed outside buildings are either made of nylon or cotton. For those displayed inside offices, the tricolor is usually fashioned from satin.The Philippine government is the No. 1 client of the Tan-Gatues. How many flags do they order? Luningning can only say “thousands, thousands.”The Armed Forces of the Philippines needs flags for its offices, camps and various field units. The Philippine Veterans Administration Office needs flags to give to the widows and families of deceased veterans. The Department of Foreign Affairs needs flags for all the embassies and consulates abroad.There’s also a flagpole at every provincial capitol, every town and city hall, every barangay hall and all schools nationwide, public and private.Producing flags for more than 41,000 barangay halls alone could keep Luningning’s workers busy.“We don’t advertise, we don’t offer our services anymore. People come to us to place orders. And offices invite us to attend biddings,” Luningning said.As the matriarch, Luningning could sit well on her laurels. These days, her twin granddaughters are already trained to attend biddings, raising the Tan-Gatue emblem even higher that their great-great-grandfather could ever imagine.",1
"In December 2015, Dengvaxia, the world’s first vaccine against dengue virus developed by French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur, was licensed and approved for use in the Philippines by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).It was first licensed in Mexico in December 2015 but only for people aged 9 to 45 living in endemic areas in the country.It is given in three doses six months apart via subcutaneous injection in the upper arm.Former Health Secretary Janette Garin said the Philippines participated in all three phases of the vaccine’s clinical development with subjects from Cebu and several areas in Metro Manila.The vaccine resulted from more than a decade of “efficacy and safety studies” in 10 countries, involving more than 30,000 children, according to the Department of Health (DOH).In April 2016, the DOH launched the program, providing free vaccines to selected Grade 4 public school pupils in three regions with the highest number of dengue cases—Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Calabarzon.Garin said the Philippines was the first in the world to introduce, adopt and implement the dengue vaccine through the public health system and under a public school setting.The DOH said more than 700,000 public school fourth graders had received the first of three doses of the vaccine under a P3.5-billion program. It said figures for how many got the additional doses were not immediately available.In October 2016, Sen. Richard Gordon said he would seek an investigation of the “undue haste” in using the vaccine despite safety questions.In December 2016, FDA directed Sanofi to stop advertisements that said Dengvaxia was available over the counter. The vaccine is a prescription drug approved only for those 9 to 45 years old.In May 2017, FDA ordered Sanofi and Watson’s Personal Care Stores to stop promoting and offering immunization services without authorization.From January to September 2017, the DOH has recorded 97,287 dengue cases nationwide.Dengue is the fastest growing mosquito-borne disease in the world, causing nearly 400 million infections annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).WHO recommends that countries should consider introducing the vaccine only in geographic settings (national or subnational) where data indicate a high dengue burden.Dr. Scott Halstead, founder of the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative and an acknowledged leading figure in dengue research in the past 50 years, voiced serious concerns about the vaccine, saying it may enhance the development of dengue, rather than prevent it.The vaccine appears to cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) that literally predisposes the dengue-naive recipients of the vaccine to a more severe clinical expression of the disease, he said.In ADE, infection with one of the four strains of the dengue virus produces antibodies to that strain and cross-reactive antibodies to the other strains. “That allows a second dengue infection to cause severe illness, including dengue hemorrhagic fever,” Halstead said.Source: Inquirer Archives, DOH website, WHO website",1

"THE Senate Committee on Ethics dismissed several complaints filed against three members of the chamber during its meeting on Tuesday.The ethics panel, headed by Senate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto 3rd, unanimously backed a motion to junk the ethics complaints filed by former Bureau of Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon against Senators Panfilo Lacson and Antonio Trillanes 4th.The committee also dismissed the three ethics complaints filed against detained Sen. Leila de Lima by officials of the House of Representatives, Malacañang spokesman Harry Roque and a lawyer.It was Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon who moved to dismiss the Faeldon complaints.The motion was seconded by Sen. Gregorio Honasan.“There is a motion to dismiss the case of Capt. Faeldon versus Ping [Lacson] and Trillanes, duly seconded and I hear no objection, so the motion is carried and cases number 9 and number 10 are hereby dismissed,” Sotto said during the committee meeting.Faeldon filed an ethics complaint against Lacson in connection with the latter’s privilege speech linking the former Customs chief to alleged corruption at the Bureau of Customs (BoC).Lacson, in his privilege speech entitled “Kita, Kita,” accused Faeldon of receiving regular tara (payoff) and a P100-millon “welcome gift” from brokers and “players” operating at the BoC.Faeldon, in his complaint, said Lacson’s public and malicious imputations were all lies and he should be expelled from office or suspended at the very least.During the panel meeting, Drilon pointed out that Lacson’s privilege speech is a subject of an investigation by the blue ribbon committee and determination of whether the allegations were true remains to be tackled in the committee report of the committee.“This [complaint] is clearly forum shopping,” he said.Faledon filed a case against Trillanes for claiming that the former was “at the heart” of the controversy involving a P6.4-billion shipment of shabu from China.He said Trillanes should be expelled for serious misconduct and abuse of his rights and privileges.Drilon, in moving for the junking of the complaint against Trillanes, said Faeldon has also abused his right and has made “very malicious” statements against some senators.“If anyone has abused his right to criticize public officials, Faeldon is as guilty as anybody,” he added.The ethics committee also dismissed the three ethics cases filed against de Lima for lack of jurisdiction.Among the cases that were dismissed was a complaint filed by House Committee on Justice chairman Rep. Reynaldo Umali, House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas in connection with de Lima’s repeated refusal to appear before the House justice committee hearing on alleged proliferation of illegal drugs inside the New Bilibid Prisons (NBP) and another complaint filed by Roque.Roque, in his complaint, said de Lima allegedly conspired with Kabayan party-list Rep. Ron Salo for her to carry out her illegal activities inside the NBP.Drilon, in pushing for the dismissal of the complaint against de Lima, cited a pending court case against the latter that is similar to the ethics case.He explained that if de Lima gets acquitted in the Metropolitan Trial Court for that, there is no reason for the ethics committee to hear the pending case, which is similar to the court case.Drilon cited the pending case in courts also lodged against de Lima and the committee’s lack of jurisdiction over the alleged violations she had committed.When sought for comment, Roque agreed with the Senate’s move to dismiss the complaints against de Lima for lack of jurisdiction.“I think it’s because of lack of jurisdiction. The acts attributed were acts committed before her assumption into the office of a senator of the Republic,” he said during a news conference.With the dismissal of the five ethics complaints, the committee is now left with four complaints against Senators Risa Hontiveros filed by Justice Secretary Vitalliano Aguirre 2nd, Richard Gordon filed by Trillanes and two cases against Trillanes filed by Gordon and lawyer Abelardo de Jesus.",1

"A London School of Economics-trained economist, quoting the latest technical manual (Chapter 2) of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tobacco Tax Administration, said a unitary tax system favors producers of expensive brands, a segment dominated by multinational tobacco companies.Dr. Ernesto R. Gonzales, post-graduate professor at University of the Philippines-Manila, added, “That’s why the European Commission, recognizing the health objectives of cigarette excises, simultaneously impose two types of taxes on tobacco—a specific tax to set a minimum floor which is high enough to discourage smoking and an ad valorem tax for progressivity.”Gonzales cautioned lawmakers and pro-health advocates that they might be overlooking the issue of upshifting to premium brands under a unitary tax regime because of negligible gaps in retail prices.Under provisions of Republic Act 10351 or the sin tax reform law, the Philippines is now under a unitary tax regime where cigarettes are taxed P30 per pack regardless of classification (non-premium and premium).“In fact,” Gonzales said, when the price gap between cheaper and more expensive brands narrows, the price increase, due to higher taxation, may alter consumers’ marginal willingness to pay for product ‘quality’ subject to income.”According to him, “the hypothesis that the market share of lower-priced cigarettes falls when specific excises increase, as the relative price between higher- and lower-priced cigarettes is reduced, is supported by empirical evidence. Sobel and Garrett (1997) find that increases in specific taxes reduced the market share of generic (lower-priced) brands in the U.S. significantly.”The manual further states: “Theory shows that profits are relatively higher under specific taxation (e.g. Delipalla and Keen, 1992). Moreover, a tax increase may lead to an increase in profits. More than 100 percent overshifting (i.e. prices rise by more than the tax increase itself) is a requisite for an increase in profits: as a higher tax increases consumer price and reduces demand, for profits to rise, the after-tax mark up must rise. It is not therefore surprising that tobacco multinationals prefer specific taxes.”Philip Morris International’s (PMI) 2015 annual report (page 57) supports this upshifting trend, “The decline in our cigarette shipment volume reflected the lower total market combined with lower consumption of our low and super-low price brands, following price increases in late 2014 and early 2015, partly offset by higher market share, driven by adult smoker uptrading (upshifting) to Marlboro, combined with market share growth of Fortune, reflecting the narrowing of retail price gaps with brands at the bottom end of the market.”Collated data in the same page of the report also showed that Marlboro sales in the Philippines increased by 2.7% that roughly translates into billions of pesos.Gonzales supported former National Economic and Development Authorit chief Romulo Neri’s statement that Table 1 of SEATCA Tobacco Tax Index 2015 report shows only Brunei Darussalam and Singapore out of 10 Southeast Asian countries with a unitary excise tax.“He did not misuse data provided by SEATCA but merely cited it objectively,” he pointed out.“Comparatively,” Gonzales said, “Page 36 of the WHO manual shows a table that out of 182 countries, 60 used ad valorem [according to value], 48 used mix ad valorem and specific excise tax system while specific (unitary or multi-tier) excise tax are applied in 55 countries and 19 have no excise taxes at all.”In concluding his argument, he pointed out that the two-tier tax rates under House Bil. 4144 are higher than the current unitary tax rate and is pro-health since poor smokers are more elastic to price changes, thus a P32 tax (under two-tier) is more discouraging than a P30 rate while noting that poor smokers are sensitive to price increases.",1
"Like a farmer who knows the lay of his land, militant peasant leader Rafael Mariano has readied his to-do list for his first 100 days as agrarian reform secretary.His order of business includes filing cases against illegal and premature land conversion, reviewing agribusiness, leasehold and stock distribution arrangements between landowners and tenants, and seeking to condone bank penalties on unpaid farmer payments.He will also ask President-elect Rodrigo Duterte to convene the highest agrarian policymaking body for the first time in six years, and order an inventory of all agrarian reform beneficiaries since the 1970s.His priority case, however, is the Hacienda Luisita sugarcane plantation in Tarlac owned by President Aquino’s Cojuangco relatives.Mariano said he would personally hold a “consultation” with Hacienda Luisita farm workers, this time with the authority of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR).The 59-year-old former Anakpawis representative has promised to himself that no farmer, whether an agrarian reform beneficiary or not, will be ejected from his land on his watch.“Maybe my advantage is I come from a family of farmers, I have more than 30 years [in the peasant movement]. So I will do my best to defend agrarian reform. It’s my continuing advocacy: genuine agrarian reform,” Mariano said in an interview on Friday.The longtime leader of Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas has just concluded a four-day conference with DAR officials from all over the country.New law needed“I told them, ‘You know where Ka Paeng Mariano is coming from.’ I know that the existing agrarian laws and programs have inherent flaws, limitations and imperfections. But it is my continuing advocacy to implement a genuine agrarian reform program and my advocacy is that we need a new law [for that],” he said.Since the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms (CARPer) lapsed on June 30, 2014, the DAR can no longer issue notices of coverage to a still substantial number of private agricultural landholdings, mostly in the Negros provinces.Mariano, author of “genuine agrarian reform” bills that never made it past the landlord-dominated House of Representatives, said he “urged” DAR officials to study the bill since they would defend the proposed measure once refiled in July.He said he would ask Duterte to certify the bill urgent, along with the free irrigation and coconut levy bills.Order of businessHis order of business for his first 100 days in office are:Order a quick inventory of the 2.7 million farmers who have supposedly been awarded a total 4.7 million hectares from 1972 to 2015 to find out if the farmers still control the land.Reintroduce the genuine agrarian reform bill in Congress.Encourage farmers’ groups to file petitions for a notice of coverage of their agricultural land even if the DAR’s authority to issue a notice of coverage has lapsed, since the department will start the documentation process.Immediately review past orders issued on land exemption, exclusion, retention, conversion and cancellation of titles given to beneficiaries to find out how much agrarian reform-covered land have been taken back from farmers.Review and file charges against landowners in cases of “illegal, premature and unauthorized conversions,” citing a violation by Tarlac Development Corp. in Hacienda Luisita.Validate the stock distribution option in Hacienda Luisita and other haciendas in the Negros provinces.Ask the Land Bank of the Philippine board of directors to condone the penalties imposed on arrears of farmers who are still paying their amortization.Ask Duterte to convene the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) within the first 100 days to resolve with finality several cases on appeal.Review agribusiness contracts and agricultural leasehold contracts between landowners and tenants covering 3 million hectares, whether the contracts are already disadvantageous to the farmers.Fix rentalsMariano said the DAR had the authority to fix the lease rentals.“I will be there. We will try to hold a consultation with agrarian reform beneficiaries in Hacienda Luisita in the first 100 days,” he said.“That’s why I want to convene the PARC to set this clear policy and I will suggest this to President Duterte: that no farmer can be evicted from the land he tills whether he is in an area covered by an agricultural leasehold, an agribusiness venture agreement or even in an area that is not yet covered by land acquisition,” Mariano said.

"FORMER Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin “Junjun” Binay Jr. is asking the Sandiganbayan’s Third Division to reconsider its resolution to proceed with the trial of graft and falsification charges lodged against him and several others in connection with the alleged anomalous construction of the Makati City Hall Parking Building.The anti-graft court, which earlier found probable cause to proceed to trial, affirmed the earlier findings of the Office of the Ombudsman, which filed the charges in February last year.The case stems from alleged irregularities surrounding the awarding of a contract to build the Makati City Hall Parking Building to Hilmarc’s Construction Corp.Binay, son of former vice president and long-time Makati mayor Jejomar Binay, is being accused of conspiring with several former Makati City officials in rigging the bidding process and falsifying documents to facilitate the awarding of the contract.Lacking evidenceHe argued, however, that the findings of the Office of the Ombudsman that the Sandiganbayan upheld “lack any hint of evidence.”The former Makati City mayor said there were no overt acts that would constitute the crimes alleged against him, and that he was being charged as a conspirator in a scheme “without concrete bases that will show acts in unison” with it.Moreover, the Sandiganbayan failed to consider that the alleged falsification of an Affidavit of Publication could be committed without his participation, Binay said.Presumption of regularityHe argued further that at the time the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) decided to award the contract to Hilmarc’s, “there were no instances on hand to show any irregularity in the proceedings, considering that there was nothing in the BAC Resolution and the Disbursement Vouchers which appeared to be irregular on their face.”“In particular, the bid documents presented to Accused Binay Jr. included the requisite notarized Affidavit of Publication, attesting to the fact that the Invitation to Bid was indeed advertised,” Binay’s motion for reconsideration read.Binay said he could not be held liable for relying on the notarized document, “which carried with it the presumption of due execution and authenticity.”Also, “the element of ‘undue injury’ is absent considering that the alleged overpricing of the construction was never established,” he said.Overlapping chargesThe Makati City Hall Parking Building was constructed in five phases with one design phase spanning 2007 to 2013, covering the respective terms of Binay and his father.When the cases against the younger Binay were filed in February last year, the older Binay enjoyed immunity from suit as he was vice president at the time.Graft, malversation, and falsification cases against Binay Sr. and several others were thus filed after his term as vice president ended. These were consolidated with the ones earlier filed where the younger Binay was charged as a respondent.The younger Binay is among the respondents in the malversation case and two counts of graft filed against his father and several others. The Sandiganbayan, however, has yet to rule on whether there is basis to try these cases.",1
" Why are Filipino fishermen attracted to Scarborough Shoal in the West Philippine Sea?The answer came when fishermen—fresh from three days of fishing at the shoal—unloaded their catch at the coastal village of Cato here.The shoal’s 150-square-kilometer lagoon, as well as the waters surrounding this disputed set of sea rocks, is home to high-value fish species, such as tanigue (narrow-barred Spanish mackerel), lapu-lapu (grouper) and maya-maya (red snapper).The crew of fishing vessel Ruvina 3 returned on Saturday, confirming that Chinese Coast Guard vessels have stopped harassing Filipino fishermen who enter Scarborough Shoal, also known to Filipinos as Panatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc.This triangular chain of reefs and rocks, which is about 240 kilometers southwest of Infanta, was seized by China in 2012.High-value fish species are abundant around the shoal because it is where they breed, said Westly Rosario, chief of the National Integrated Fisheries Technology Development Center.“The natural environment there is good and there is no fishing pressure yet,” Rosario said.“It’s a perfect breeding ground because it’s a coral reef. The smaller fish are in the lagoon and the bigger fish are in the deep waters surrounding the shoal,” he said.Rosario said the fish thriving at the shoal were also free from diseases.Panatag’s lagoon is about 2 meters deep, so a fishermen could throw a fishing net to catch talakitok (jack), isdang bato (small red snapper), loro (parrot fish) and danggit (rabbit fish), said fishermen Gerry Rizol, 51, a Ruvina 3 crew member.“We also use a spear gun to catch fish,” Rizol said.Rizol and the crew brought back Spanish mackerel and bacalao (cod fish) to Cato. They also caught a few red snappers and groupers.The Spanish mackerel and the cod fish weighed at least 9 kilos. At the average price of P200 a kg, one mackerel could have been sold for P1,800.Artificial reefsThey earned much less for the yellow fin tuna and gulyasan (skipjack) caught two days earlier, when Ruvina crew members paddled to the different payao (artificial reefs) scattered some 18 to 37 kilometers from the shoal.According to the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources’ fresh fish prices monitor, a kilogram of yellow fin tuna has an average price of P130 while skipjack sells for about P100 a kg.Ruvina fishermen dropped their hooks and lines at the payao when they were first driven away by the Chinese vessels on Oct. 23, Rizol said.Their catch from the payao was not enough for the boat owner to recoup the P100,000 in expenses for each fishing trip, he said.So Ruvina sneaked back to the shoal on Oct. 25 and the crew was surprised to find other Filipino fishing vessels anchored at the shoal.The Chinese vessels in the area did not budge when the crew began harvesting the riches of the shoal.",1
"BS Aquino has a skewed logic that when he is criticized, it is taken as an attack against his person. Well, that goes for most of filipinos, too. And then they switch to a full-on defense and counter attack mode, and the last resort is get emotional.So ok, some criticisms are a bit on the harsh and nasty side, and some people will say, that criticisms can be said in a ""nicer way""...that is true.....in pre-school/nursery. This is the real world, where his smallest decisions could mean loss of livelihood for some or worse loss of human lives.With his track record and kind of personality, I wouldn't even trust him to drive my rig across a technical obstacle. That says a lot about how he would be running his life or this country, for that matter. Trust is earned and not shoved down someone's throat. 50+ years is a really long time to earn the people's trust, and what he has to show for now are not people who trust him, but people who have blind faith on his capacity to do his job as president.People who defend BS Aquino by saying ""mahirap maging presidente"" should be answered by saying, he should have realized that before running for president. Now is not the time to make excuses for shortfalls. A more mature leader would report these shortfalls concretely and would have a clear road map on how to address each. Next report should state clearly how far he has gone in solving these issues. He should stop waving his checkered flag on his so called ""achievements"", instead should already have plans set up clearly for the rest of his remaining tenure. It is a virtue for a leader to be humble about his achievements, he just did the opposite.Lastly, instead of strengthening unity within the country, he went full-on divisive by indirectly saying that those who are against his whims are evil. So much for person who is product of a 1986 fad, with a song entitled ""Magkaisa"" as one of it's soundtracks. Not unless the word ""naisahan"" comes mind.

"HOW DO you explain the Duterte administration’s war on drugs to schoolchildren?The Philippine National Police is going to use a puppet show, a mascot and a comic book, said Senior Supt. Gilbert Cruz, director of the PNP Police Community Relations Group (PCRG).In a speech on Monday at the PCRG’s 24th founding anniversary celebration in Camp Crame, Quezon City, Cruz said the unit was set to conduct an “anti-illegal drugs road show” in schools and barangays nationwide.He said the road show would feature puppet shows, a visit from new PNP mascot “PO1 Bato” and the distribution of pamphlets, including a comic book titled “Itaga Mo sa Bato,” penned by Cruz himself.The police officers assembled at the flag-raising ceremony on Monday got a sneak preview of the child-friendly measures, with a dance performance from PO1 Bato, prompting laughter even from PNP Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, on whom the mascot was based.Tatay DigongA show, “Tatay Digong and Da Adiks,” featured a puppet modeled on President Duterte. The puppet had a “Bisaya” accent and blurted out memorable quotes, which tickled the police personnel.The show also featured puppet versions of Dela Rosa, which likewise captured his accent and quips.Mobile app“On top of [the PCRG’s] priorities and projects targeting schoolchildren and the youth, is eliciting their interest and appreciation of programs relative to the PNP’s anti-illegal drug campaign; opening their eyes and ears to the ill effects of illegal drugs and the menace that they pose to their families and society,” Cruz said.",1
"A security guard armed with a shotgun killed a peasant leader in a rice field in Coron, a popular resort town in the tourist famous Busuanga island group in Palawan province.Arnel Figueroa, 44, was hit in the stomach by a single round fired by Dan Nelson Mayo, a member of the “Blue Guards” of the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI), on Tuesday at Yulo King Ranch (YKR).Figueroa was a local leader of Pesante, an organization of farmers seeking the distribution of land under the 1988 Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). He was the latest fatality in the decades-long battle by impoverished farmers for freedom from bondage to the soil that has taken an ugly turn.“Before, the fight was against landlords, now it is against the government,” said Libertine Amor, a lawyer for the Catholic Church-backed Climate Change Congress of the Philippines (CCCP), the umbrella group for peasant organizations.Figueroa, whose wife is pregnant with his fourth child, had been at the forefront of a six-year clamor for the distribution of part of the Yulo ranch they had planted with rice, sweet potatoes, bananas and coconut on the island paradise of white sand beaches and luxury hotels.On Tuesday, under a light rain, Mayo and several government personnel escorted by four Marines started uprooting crops. Figueroa attempted to talk to them, but Mayo shot him at pointblank range. Figueroa slumped dead, his lower torso covered with blood.The killing was captured on a cell phone video by Maria Maaya L. Thind, 36, general secretary of the 10,000-strong Pesante. Another farmer was wounded.Police custodyMayo is under police custody. Fearing he would be spirited out, farmers had picketed the police station where he was detained.Figueroa was with a peasant group that met with then President Benigno Aquino III in June 2014.Aquino had promised to extend the CARP for two years to enable the distribution of 620,000 hectares of the nation’s prime agricultural land that had so far eluded coverage.His mother, President Corazon Aquino, launched the program in 1988 as the centerpiece of a social justice program to eliminate one of the major causes of a pestering communist insurgency.Implementation has been slow. The program was riddled with loopholes. The Aquino family’s sprawling Hacienda Luisita, was first to escape coverage, through a stock dividend option that the Supreme Court later knocked down because it did not improve the lives of the farmers.The son’s promise remained unfulfilled.Figueroa had raised the YKR issue in the 2014 meeting. He had moved to Coron in 2009, to escape harassment by landowners in Mindoro that hounded his father, Patricio, a former Huk, the people’s army formed to fight the Japanese during World War II that later became a Marxist movement.The elder Figueroa disappeared after he was kidnapped while campaigning for the distribution of land owned by a crony of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.Sequestered landFigueroa had been cultivating a portion of the 40,000-hectare estate, which was declared by Marcos in 1975 as pasture land. Upon the ouster of Marcos in 1986, the rolling forested hills and verdant fields, owned by his cronies Jose Yulo and Peter Sabido, were sequestered as ill-gotten wealth.In March 2010, the Supreme Court lifted the sequestration and transferred it to Philippine Forest Corp., at one time headed by Rodolfo Lozada, a whistle-blower in the NBN-ZTE scandal that hit the Arroyo administration. He was recently convicted of graft for distributing land to his relatives, including a part of the Yulo ranch.In May 2010, before President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo stepped aside, she issued lease contracts to businesses and generals who had supported her when she was facing coup attempts, authorizing “other development intervention” in the area that had become a favored tourist destination and subject of land speculation.These contracts, covering two-thirds of the estate, were later rescinded by the Aquino administration, giving hope to the farmers.In 2013, Aquino transferred the administration of the YKR estate to the Forest Management Bureau. By then the ranch, once touted as the biggest in Asia, had only around 1,000 head of cattle, a far cry from its robust operation as a cattle breeding and livestock quarantine station.Around 12,000 ha of the estate had been declared as “alienable and disposable.” Figueroa’s group farmed a portion of this land; BAI wanted 2,000 ha for pasture.Cattle rampageFarmers claim BAI personnel send cattle rampaging through land planted with rice, uprooted crops and destroyed huts. Cases have been filed against farmers by BAI, whose lawyers came from the Office of the Solicitor General.“We cry for justice,” the CCCP said in a statement signed by Archbishop Antonio J. Ledesma of Cagayan de Oro, and former Election Commissioner Christian Monsod. “The farmers are not pigs, they are human beings.”Evangeline Silva, Pesante president, said Figueroa had been so happy he and several hundred farmers recently received certificates of ownership of the land they had been cultivating.“We are not rebels. He had given us hope that we can dream on and get the land we seek peacefully,” said Silva, 43, a mother of seven children who went to Coron after her husband, also an agrarian reform activist, was killed by policemen, who claimed he was a drug pusher.RELATED STORIES",1

"Sen. Francis (Kiko) Pangilinan on Wednesday filed Philippine Senate Resolution 271, which seeks to conduct inquiries into social media platforms that allow the spread of fake news.Pangilinan filed PSR 271 to hold hearings on the rise of fake news and misinformation on social media platforms, especially on Facebook, and penalize them for failing “to provide an environment that enables the balanced flow of information into, out of, and across the country.”The senator wants penalties that “will have to ‘hurt’ the giant social media company” for it to act on the sudden increase of fake news on the internet. Such penalties, he said, will include a fist fight with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.Pangilinan’s fist fight challenge was inspired by the recent incident on the Senate floor in which his colleagues Senators Antonio Trillanes and Miguel Subiri almost engaged in a fistfight to settle an argument.Pangilinan told The Adobo Chronicles that he is also considering asking Zubiri if he’d be willing to engage Zuckerberg in an Arnis (Filipino martial arts) fight. Zubiri is an Arnis world champion. A boxing match between Zuckerberg and Senator Manny Pacquiao is also being considered, Pangilinan added.As of press time, Zuckerberg had not responded to the challenge.",0

"THE BRUISES and wounds on 3-year-old Caitie Lucas’ frail hands and arms are more than just signs that she is fighting a disease that requires countless needle pricks and frequent trips to the hospital.For her parents, Feliz and Jayjay, the marks on her limbs are also great reminders of Jesus Christ’s own wounds and the promise of redemption and healing.“Before, I didn’t want to look at all the puncture wounds Caitie has on her wrists and arms. [But] I would always tell her to remember Jesus when he was nailed to the cross [and] had marks, too,” Feliz said.“Hers, in time, will heal and these will be a great reminder of a greater testimony that Christ has given her at such a young age,” added the 30-year-old mother added.Caitie was recently diagnosed with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) by doctors in Singapore. It is blood cancer so rare that it strikes only one in a million children in the United States and has no known treatment protocol.Chronicled in “Courageous Caitie,” a Facebook page her mother set up, the young girl’s story of pain, bravery and faith has captivated thousands of people, restored friendships diminished by time and distance, and moved even strangers to come together and help the struggling family of four.Her diagnosis came after an agonizing two months of fighting the condition in two prime hospitals in Manila, where she was seen by 33 doctors and underwent several excision biopsies, bone marrow aspirations, multiple blood extractions and transfusions but still didn’t get a definite diagnosis.Early symptomsEarly symptoms began in September last year in the form of lesions similar to mosquito bites suddenly appearing in her arms and legs. These were initially diagnosed as a simple case of allergic reaction to insect bites and later on as tuberculosis.But three months later, Caitie’s symptoms worsened despite treatment for the infectious disease: Her skin lesions got bad, spreading to her face, and she developed abdominal pain, an enlarged spleen and liver, and chronic diarrhea.After nearly two months of hospital confinement that began on New Year’s Day and the medical bills ballooned to P4.5 million, three times more than the family’s savings, without a concrete diagnosis, the Lucases took a leap of faith. They flew to Singapore on Feb. 21.Seeking medical treatment abroad meant they had to temporarily leave behind their year-old son in the care of relatives and run their business remotely so they could still raise the amount needed for Caitie’s treatment.Feliz, a known engagement stylist, and her husband, Jayjay, a wedding photographer, run a professional wedding photography and styling studio in Manila.Following their arrival in Singapore, Caitie underwent another battery of tests at National University Hospital, the city-state’s premier medical teaching institution. After 10 days, the couple finally got an answer as to what was ailing their little girl.Anger“Prior to the diagnosis, I didn’t question ‘why’ and I accepted whatever would come knowing it’s His best plan,” Feliz told the Inquirer. “Then came the diagnosis. I honestly asked why. I got angry and almost turned my back on [God],” she said.“I cried why it had to be Caitie. Of all the diseases, why it had to be so rare [but] after crying my heart out in honesty to God, I got to process things and realized that the journey is still better with God in the picture than to turn [my] back on Him because with Him there is hope,” she said.Rather than look at their daughter’s ailment as a curse or a punishment from God, the parents changed their perspective and slowly learned to appreciate the little miracles and blessings it brought to their struggling family.“Instead of anger [and the question of] ‘why us?’ It turned to humility. ‘Why us to receive such a miracle?’ We chose to see the good in things,” she said.Doctors were particularly amazed at how her daughter defied the odds on many occasions and how she was taking pain and suffering beyond her years, Feliz said.At one point, her platelet count plummeted to a dangerous level of 3,000, but she did not bleed as other patients had with a count anywhere below 90,000, she recounted. (A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 400,000.)Caitie also never resisted needle procedures and fasting, making work easy for her doctors and nurses. When in pain, she would merely ask her parents to hold her hands for comfort and distract herself with books and videos of her favorite Bible stories, like David and Goliath.PaintingDespite being restricted by wires and drips, even at her lowest blood mark, Caitie would continue to make her confined environment bright and cheerful by keeping busy with colorful arts and crafts and painting, her current favorite hobby.She also did not like passing up on simple tasks like going to the bathroom for a toilet break even during her worst bouts of diarrhea or buttoning up her hospital pajamas.“She knows how to process pain. She would eat on her own, do things on her own. Even if she’s having a difficult time breathing, she would give her best and fix her clothes, talk and try her best to walk even if it was so difficult,” Feliz said.The little girl also knew how to ask for divine help. The mother recalled that upon hearing earlier this month that she could continue treatment as an outpatient, Caitie inquired how she could go home with an IV plug.PrayerThe mother suggested that they pray. The little girl obeyed and implored, “Dear Jesus, please remove the wire so I can go home.”“She is indeed more resilient than both of us. We get shattered immediately but her, it’s like nothing unusual … the Lord really sustains her. I guess, it’s God’s way of affirming that He has this and He has been faithful in all aspects,” she said.The deluge of support and help from childhood friends, old classmates, churchmates, colleagues in the industry and strangers touched by Caitie’s example of fortitude and composure has also surprised and overwhelmed the family.“Friends I’ve never seen since grade school would come and visit. Strangers pump breast milk in our room, give money, blood and just give anything and everything they can to help …. Groups that have been disconnected came together after years and teamed up to create fundraising events,” Feliz said.Having a little girl unite these people to spread generosity and exercise selflessness was another thing to be thankful for despite their tough circumstance, she pointed out.“I realized people are drawn to our story because we are genuine in showing our vulnerability—that we are weak, that we get angry too, that we question and we struggle. But at the end of it all, we choose God still,” Jayjay said.In Singapore, the family’s daily needs were sustained by the generosity of Filipinos working there, who would bring them toiletries and homecooked meals daily, take care of their laundry, donate blood in the middle of the night or just give them comforting words, Feliz said.Fundraising eventsBack home, various groups have voluntarily come up with a host of fundraising events—from marathon photo sessions and makeup tutorials to benefit dinners and garage sales—to come up with P15 million for Caitie’s treatment, which includes splenectomy, cell therapy and a bone marrow transplant.Local artists, young and old, have also joined the fundraising by putting up their works for auction online. Some friends have tapped the crowdfunding platform online GoFundMe, which raised nearly half of the total amount needed for Caitie’s treatment in just 24 days.Feliz disclosed that earlier, the family had contemplated using its tithe to the church to defray hospital expenses but decided against it. “We wanted to put God first. I think because of it, God rewarded us and literally flooded us with His riches,” she said.Only treatment optionCaitie recently finished a short course of low-dose chemotherapy. In the next two to three months, she will be undergoing several other procedures that would bring her safely to a bone marrow transplant, the only treatment option for JMML.“It’s risky, scary and more unknown but if God was able to supply all our needs and wants comfortably in all aspects and was able to sustain Caitie for six months since September [even] without diagnosis, then the next three months is an easy leg,” Feliz said.She said the family would move forward one day at a time, pinning its hope on the restoration and joy that would come.“Faith is not just walking on water. It’s knowing that the one whom you put your faith into has already walked on water. So what would stop us from following through?” Feliz said.",1
"The Supreme Court re-affirmed the legality of the enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the Philippines and the US in July this year. Is Duterte correct in saying he would jettison EDCA?Former Ambassador to Greece, Malaysia, and Singapore Alberto A. Encomienda said “yes.”Encomienda, a retired career Foreign Service Officer with LLM degrees from the University of London and Columbia University, gave a background of the MDT status today.“It’s no longer there,” he says of MDT, saying it has gone the way of the extinct dodo bird, vanished.He said the main tragedy in the present military scenario for the Philippines is that “it tries to infuse credibility to a military option by invoking the Ph-US MDT where there is not even a mutual understanding between the two parties… and the nature of the iron-clad guarantee announced by President Barack Obama’s State Visit to the Philippines in April, 2014.”“When queried by the local news media, the US Ambassador Philip Goldberg refused to clarify on Obama’s statements, casting doubts on the true intention of our superpower treaty ally,” says Encomienda.He said the US declared that the PH-USA MDT does not apply to the Spratlys archipelago inasmuch as it is not part of the Metropolitan territory of the Philippines.”He said article 4 of the MDT defines the subject of the TREATY as being “an armed attack in the Pacific Area on either of the Partners.”Encomienda has reservation with the MDT’s termination clause because “the termination clause made it appear that it will go on for as long as there are oceans in the world, what we call “an indeterminate termination clause.”Since the treaty says it will continue until it is abrogated by either side, with a one year notice, in effect “it says this treaty is valid until a regional system of collective defense has been put in place.”He said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had replaced the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), which is long dead, matagal nang patay.Since SEATO is dead, MDT is also passe, wala na rin because it’s like in any conditional agreement, if the condition does not happen, the agreement falls through.”(To be continued)",1

"DETAINED former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is certain to be reelected Pampanga representative. So are reelectionists Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos and Pampanga Gov. Lilia “Baby” Pineda.Running unopposed, Arroyo, Marcos and Pineda are among 542 local candidates in the May 9 elections who are assured of victory even before the official start of campaigning on Black Saturday.The biggest number of unopposed candidates are in Ilocos Sur (25), Isabela (21), Ilocos Norte (19), Pangasinan (16), Apayao (11), and Cagayan and Pampanga (10 each).Uncontested political races do not sit well with some political scientists.“Elections are meaningful only when voters have a choice,” said Alejandro Ciencia Jr., a political science professor at the University of the Philippines Baguio.“Elections ideally compel politicians to present issues, and lay down proposed policies,” Ciencia said.He said elections gave voters some form of leverage to demand governmental reforms.“Politicians are calculating actors in the political environment. They run when they believe they can win or when they have secured some form of advantage,” he said, so they would heed a position that is pushed by the people.The reasons a candidate for political office can run unchallenged are still areas of speculation, however.For example, some unchallenged candidacies are in areas reputed to be controlled by political dynasties.Cordillera, IlocosThe reelection bids of Apayao Gov. Elias Bulut Jr. and Apayao Rep. Eleanor Bulut-Begtang are certainties, with no opponent willing to challenge them.Their late father, Calanasan Mayor Elias Bulut Sr., served as governor and congressman of the province since it separated from Kalinga more than 20 years ago.In Ilocos Sur province, Gov. Ryan Singson is also running unopposed. His father, former Gov. Luis “Chavit” Singson, is now running for councilor of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur.In Bataan province, reelectionist Gov. Albert “Abet” Garcia is running unopposed alongside his father, Rep. Enrique “Tet” Garcia, who is running unchallenged for vice governor. Tet’s youngest son, Balanga mayoral candidate Francis Garcia, and daughter, reelectionist Dinalupihan Mayor Gila Garcia, have no opponents also.In Bulacan province, San Rafael Mayor Cipriano Violago Jr. has no opponent, a far cry from his dramatic 2013 election victory. He was a former vice mayor who defeated his former running mate, former Mayor Lorna Silverio, although he was implicated in the murder of a police officer in May 2013. Violago won and was later cleared of murder charges in April 2014, after he negotiated an out-of-court settlement.Cordillera regionSince the 1990s, elections in indigenous communities have supposedly been predetermined by their elders. It may not be so this year in the Cordillera region, where only two congressmen, two governors, one vice governor, 11 mayors and 12 vice mayors are running unopposed.“Elections should not be the subject of any preelection agreement. To do so would be a mockery of the election process,” said John Martin, Baguio election officer of the Commission on Elections.Election laws are silent about prearranged political races, he said. Voters become hostages to these political agreements, he added.Many of the unchallenged candidates are incumbents. They are:Ilocos Norte—Gov. Imee Marcos and Vice Gov. Eugenio Barba, Banna Mayor Carlito Abadilla III, Batac City Vice Mayor Jeffrey Nalupta, Dingras Vice Mayor Joefrey Saguid, Dumalneg Mayor Lairvee Espiritu and Vice Mayor Francisco Espiritu Jr., Pinili Mayor Samuel Pagdilao Sr. and Laoag City Mayor Chevylle Fariñas.Ilocos Sur—Gov. Ryan Singson and Vice Gov. Jeremiah “Jerry” Singson, Alilem Mayor Mar Ruel Sumabat and Vice Mayor Onofre Bistoyong, and Magsingal Mayor Alrico Favis and his mother Vice Mayor Arlyn Favis.In the congressional races in Metro Manila, six reelectionist candidates are running unopposed. They are Representatives Miro Quimbo (Marikina City, second district), Carlo Lopez (Manila, second district), Winnie Castelo (Quezon City, second district), Jorge Banal (Quezon City, third district), Alfred Vargas (Quezon City, fifth district) and Kit Belmonte (Quezon City, sixth district).Southern LuzonIn Southern Luzon, 11 candidates for congressional seats, led by Evelina Escudero of Sorsogon, mother of Sen. Francis Escudero, are running unopposed. Ten of these candidates are from Southern Tagalog and Escudero is the lone unopposed candidate for representative in the Bicol region.In Cavite, candidates for four out of seven congressional districts are running unopposed. All of them are reelectionists, except for Bacoor City Mayor Strike Revilla, who is running for representative of the lone district of Bacoor.The three other unopposed candidates for representative are Alex Advincula (third district), Luis Ferrer IV (sixth district) and Abraham Tolentino (seventh district).Tolentino is a brother of former Metro Manila Development Authority Chair Francis Tolentino, who is running for senator. Tolentino’s wife, Agnes, is running unopposed as mayor of Tagaytay City.Joaquin Chipeco Jr. will be on his second term as Laguna representative (second district) after two other candidates, withdrew their candidacies.Three-term Sta. Rosa City Mayor Arlene Arcillas is the lone candidate for representative of Laguna’s first district.Visayas-MindanaoIn the Visayas, 51 candidates for congressional representative, mayor, vice mayor, governor and vice governor in Western, Central and Eastern Visayas as well as in Negros Island Region are running unopposed.The lone unopposed candidate in Eastern Visayas is Vice Gov. Carlo Loreto of Leyte who is seeking reelection under the Liberal Party.Reelectionist Rep. Arthur Defensor Jr. of Iloilo said he was glad to be running unopposed in the third congressional district. “In a way, it is a validation from my constituents that what I have been doing for them is satisfactory,” he said.Negros Occidental Gov. Alfredo Marañon Jr., is seeking a third term unopposed. His son, Sagay City Mayor Alfredo Marañon III and nephew, Rep. Rafael Leo Cueva of Negros Occidental’s second district, are likewise unopposed.Three siblings in southern Negros Occidental are running unopposed under the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC). They are Rep. Mercedes Alvarez of then sixth district and her brothers, Ilog Mayor Genaro Rafael Alvarez and Ilog Vice Mayor Paul Alvarez.In several Mindanao areas, including those identified as among the country’s poorest provinces, members of old political clans and their allies are without challengers in May.Adolph Edward Plaza, 53, the unopposed reelectionist governor of Agusan del Sur, is the son of former Rep. and Agusan Gov. Democrito Plaza and Valentina Galido Plaza, also a former governor.For the two congressional districts of Agusan del Norte, Plaza’s sisters, Ma.

"The Senate blue ribbon committee has summoned the principal characters in the alleged laundering of $81 million stolen from the US account of the central bank of Bangladesh to an investigation next week.Summoned to the inquiry that opens on Tuesday are Lorenzo Tan, president and CEO of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC), and Maia Santos-Deguito, manager of RCBC’s branch on Jupiter Street in Makati City where the $81 million was transferred by unknown computer hackers who stole the money from the account of Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of Bangladesh, in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in early February.The Inquirer first reported the bank heist and the laundering of the stolen money through the Philippine financial system on Feb. 29.Money laundering is the process by which money obtained from crime is cleaned to make it appear as derived from legal activities so that banks and other financial institutions will accept it.Also summoned to appear at the hearing are officials of the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), RCBC account holders who allegedly got the “dirty” money, and officials of casinos where $46 million was “integrated” or cleaned up, emerging as winnings.An AMLC investigation into the entry of the large amount in foreign currency into the Philippine financial system led to the discovery of the operation and to freeze orders from the Court of Appeals.According to the investigation, Deguito facilitated the transfer of the $81 million to five accounts in her branch.But Deguito countered that Tan instructed her to allow the transfer of the $81 million to the five accounts.Tan called Deguito’s claim an “outright lie.”Also summoned to the Senate inquiry is RCBC Compliance Unit head Fe Salmatin.William So Go, one of the account holders, was also summoned, along with other account holders Michael Francisco Cruz, Jessie Christopher Lagrosas, Alfred Santos Vergara, Enrico Vasquez and Kam Sin Wong (Kim Wong).The other resource persons are Philippine National Bank president Reynaldo Maclang; East West Bank president Antonio Moncupa Jr.; Banco de Oro president Nestor Tan; Philrem Service Corp. president Salud Bautista; Solaire Resort and Casino Manila president Thomas Arasi; Leisure and Resorts World Corp",1

"Sen. Leila de Lima confronted on Monday Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa over his changing statements on who ordered the reinstatement of Chief Supt. Marvin Marcos.At the Senate inquiry into the Nov. 5 killing of Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr., an angry De Lima peppered Dela Rosa with questions on his earlier statements that a higher up and then a “kumpadre” had called him to ask that Marcos and his men from the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG)-Region 8 not be relieved.Armed with a search warrant, a CIDG team, including Marcos, raided before dawn the subprovincial jail in Baybay City, Leyte, where the mayor was held and shot him dead.Dela Rosa admitted that Mr. Duterte’s special assistant, Christopher “Bong” Go, called him on Oct. 26 to say the President wanted to talk to him.On that day, Dela Rosa earlier ordered the relief of Marcos and some of his CIDG men after police officials he sent to Abu Dhabi to talk to the then newly arrested Kerwin Espinosa, a son of the mayor, told him that the confessed drug lord identified them as being on his payroll.De Lima last week said it was Go who called up Dela Rosa to stop the relief of Marcos and his men. President Duterte later admitted he asked Go to call Dela Rosa whom he told that he did not want Marcos relieved.The PNP chief also admitted that Mr. Duterte was his kumpadre and that the latter was a godfather at his wedding.“So you will name (the President) eventually or ultimately,” De Lima pointedly asked Dela Rosa, who shot back that if he was pressed to do so, he would identify Mr. Duterte as the one who called him.“Let’s change jobs, your honor. You be the PNP chief and if you can blame the President,” Dela Rosa told De Lima, prompting Sen. Panfilo Lacson to caution Dela Rosa.“I’ve had enough of you. All of you who are lying,” De Lima shot back at the PNP chief.The senator was apparently referring to government officials led by the President whom she accused of persecuting her and portraying her as a drug protector.RELATED VIDEO",1
"India may just have found the solution towards gun control, and other countries are closely watching.A gun company in this nation of 1.2 Billion people has just manufactured a gun designed for women: light, sleek and pink. The idea of a pink pistol came about as a result of increasing rape and violence against women. In its marketing campaign, the gun manufacturer says that “it is time women started carrying guns to protect themselves from rapists and attackers.”Now, the Indian Parliament is considering passing a legislation that would ban the manufacture of all guns, except the pink pistol. The measure is expected to reduce gun ownership among men who constitute 77 percent of all gun owners. The legislators believe that the pink pistol will discourage men who are much concerned about their “macho” image from purchasing this deadly weapon.Under the proposed legislation, current gun owners will be given six months from the passage of the law to surrender their firearms or trade them in for pink pistols.The American National Rifle Association (NRA) is reportedly very nervous about this Indian legislation and has mobilized its top lobbyists in Washington, D.C. to make sure that no such legislation is introduced in the U.S. Congress.",0

"Sen. Vicente Sotto III assumed the presidency of the Senate on Monday, taking over from Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III in a major revamp that removed the Senate presidency from the control of President Rodrigo Duterte’s Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) for the first time since 2016.Speaking to reporters, the new Senate President said the 23-member chamber would be more independent and assertive under his leadership, adding that he would not allow it to be “trampled on.”“Well, I am from NPC (Nationalist People’s Coalition). I am not a member of the opposition party or the administration party. We are the second largest political party always,” Sotto said.‘Cooperative but independent’Asked what sort of relationship he would have with the Duterte administration, he said: “It will be cordial. It will be cooperative for bills that we know will be good for the country… We will try our best to be independent, cooperative but independent.”Upon accepting the post, Sotto told his colleagues: “I am here today to accept the challenge you have given me. I am deeply humbled and sincerely grateful to Almighty God and my fellow senators who reposed their trust in me to lead this chamber in these critical and trying times.”Malacañang said it was willing to work with Sotto as it expressed respect for the decision of the majority bloc to change the Senate leadership.Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez wished Sotto luck and faster performance. “Hopefully, the passage of legislation would be better off,” he said.Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin said: “The question to the new leadership is—Do they have the guts to make the Senate independent from Malacañang? Or would they just pander to the whims of President Duterte?”Oath-takingSotto took his oath about 3:45 p.m. upon the opening of Monday’s plenary session. He was joined by members of his family, including his wife, Helen Gamboa, and their four children.It was Pimentel himself who nominated Sotto to the Senate presidency, citing the latter’s contributions to Congress.Pimentel, president of PDP-Laban, said he had no hard feelings in relinquishing the post, after his colleagues criticized his leadership style, including his lack of assertiveness in defending the chamber from Alvarez’s criticism that many bills passed by the House of Representatives were stuck in the Senate.Hours before Sotto assumed the Senate presidency, Malacañang expressed appreciation for Pimentel’s partnership with the Palace.Roque said laws, including the free tuition for all state universities and colleges, and free irrigation, would not have passed without Pimentel’s cooperation.Majority Leader ZubiriSen. Juan Miguel Zubiri was elected on Monday to replace Sotto as the majority leader.“I promise to work long hours and burn the midnight oil so we can pass legislation that will help uplift the lives of the Filipino,” Zubiri told his peers.Pimentel was elected chair of the two committees vacated by Zubiri: the panels on trade, commerce and entrepreneurship, and on cooperatives.He wished Sotto well, saying he would help the new leadership in passing the legislative agenda of Mr. Duterte.Reelection, second marriagePimentel will seek reelection in the 2019 midterm elections.He also announced his plan to marry his fiancée, Kathryn Yu, in October after filing his certificate of candidacy.Ahead of the plenary session, Pimentel denied there were any ill feelings between him and the majority bloc, after a draft Senate resolution calling for Sotto’s election to the Senate presidency gathered 15 signatures out of 17 majority senators.“This is an example of a peaceful and willing transfer of power in the Senate,” he said.Pimentel shrugged off criticisms raised by some members of the Senate majority about his leadership style.‘It’s my style, personality’“This is my style and my personality. But I wish to thank them for having tolerated or stomached me for the past 22 months,” he said in jest.The Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines said it expected Sotto to expedite the passage of his Senate Bill No. 2, or the “Act Requiring Employers in the Private Sector to Pay 14th Month Pay.”",1
"THE United Kingdom’s minister for Asia and the Pacific is in Manila for three-day talks on trade, prosperity and security with top Philippine officials.A news release from the British Embassy on Saturday said that Minister Alok Sharma will hold dialogues with Vice President Leni Robredo and a number of other senior politicians.He is also scheduled to meet with the British Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines and other business leaders, and will deliver a keynote speech at the Royal Institution’s Global Conference on Good Governance.Sharma’s visit in the country comes on the heels of the trip of British Prime Minister’s Trade Envoy to the Philippines Richard Graham last August.“The UK and Philippines have a longstanding and strong relationship, with links that get ever stronger. More than 17,000 Britons live in the Philippines and trade between our countries continues to grow,” Sharma said.The embassy noted Exports of UK goods to the Philippines grew by more than a third last year.Sharma added, “As we leave the EU [European Union] we have a great opportunity to work ever more closely with partners in Asia and Philippines will be key among that. The next few days will be an important chance to discuss trade, security and the rule of law.”",1

"China’s growing military strength and a resurgent Russia will pose growing challenges to the trans-Atlantic alliance in coming years, and NATO’s moves to bolster its capabilities could trigger a new Cold War-style arms race, a NATO report said.The report, completed once every four years, identifies 20 global trends that are likely to affect the alliance through 2035, ranging from artificial intelligence and accelerating technology development to climate change and growing inequality.General Denis Mercier, NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, told Reuters the report showed a higher risk of major interstate war than in the 2013 report.“We see a considerable increase in the risk of a major interstate conflict,” Mercier said in an interview on the sidelines of the Berlin Security Conference.His command will release a companion report that maps out what NATO should do to respond to these trends in the spring, with both documents to inform the 2019 NATO political guidance.“Having a global awareness is more necessary than before. We have to be ready for any kind of scenario,” Mercier said, noting that globalization meant NATO had to weigh factors outside its region, including military expansion by China and India.Easy access to technology and the global nature of cyberspace would make it easier for terrorist networks to expand, challenging the current near-monopoly that state actors have on high-tech weapons, the report said.Environmental factors would also play a bigger role, from higher rates of natural disasters to the increased opening of the Arctic, the report said, as well as a growth in global debt and erosion of trust in financial institutions.The report said defense spending had begun increasing after Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014, and projections called for further increases through 2045.But it warned that the increases “might create a security dilemma and start an arms race, as was the case during the Cold War”.It said competing budget priorities and fiscal constraints in member states could hamper their ability to meet NATO alliance requirement in the future.Mercier said NATO was already working to expand its capabilities in the cyber domain, and to ensure cyber protections were baked into every weapons system and network from the outset.“In NATO, we are under permanent attack in cyber,” he said, noting that the alliance had proven “quite good” at protecting itself thus far, but needed to remain vigilant.",1
"Bureau of Immigration (BI) officials admitted that they were ‘high’ on drugs when they ordered the deportation of US Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton, the primary suspect in the murder of Filipino transgender woman Jennifer Laude in October of last year.Laude, 26, was found dead in the bathroom of a motel in Olongapo City. An autopsy report said that she died by asphyxiation due to drowning and strangulation.According to witnesses, Laude was last seen checking in at the motel with Pemberton. The two had met at a nearby bar, where Pemberton was spending the night with fellow servicemen from the USS Peleliu, after participating in US-Philippines joint military exercises in Subic.The BI order was based on guidelines calling for the deportation of “undesirable aliens.” Criminal offense is sufficient ground to declare an alien “undesirable,” the BI said.Pemberton is currently being detained at a US facility inside Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City.Almost immediately following BI’s announcement of the deportation order, LGBT activists and legal luminaries criticized the agency for preempting the results of the ongoing murder trial. “How can the agency order the expulsion of a foreigner who is facing murder charges? It almost sends the wrong message that if a foreigner commits a crime in the Philippines, he would face deportation and escape punishment,” they said.‘How about the BI shut up and wait for the trial to proceed before making such a stupid announcement,” a Manila transgender activist said.Realizing their misjudgment and incompetency, top officials of BI issued an apology. “We should have realized that if Pemberton were convicted, he’d be facing imprisonment in the Philippines. We didn’t mean to imply that we will be deporting a convicted murderer and setting him free by expelling him from the country,” they added.Meanwhile, LGBT activists are planning to sue BI officials for incompetency and lack of common sense.",0

" The evil spirits that had haunted Nora Adain since she fled her home in Rio Hondo have all but vanished.“I am happier now,” said the 33-year-old, one of the Badjaos, or sea gypsies, moved to a permanent resettlement site at Vale Vista in this city, which was engulfed in fighting for three weeks in September 2013.“I have a house now,” said the widow, a mother of three children.“I have a livelihood,” she added, referring to a P10,000 assistance grant she had invested buying and selling fish.She pointed to the latticed bamboo walls of the 22-square-meter hut, cooled by the breeze from the sea.“The wind drives away evil spirits. It makes you feel good,” she said.But Adain broke down in tears as she recalled the good life in Rio Hondo before her diabetic husband, a dockyard porter, died, and the area was leveled in the fighting between government forces and the Moro National Liberation Front.More than 100,000 residents fled their homes, taking refuge in makeshift encampments in squalid conditions. Land problems hobbled immediate resettlement.The uprooted were then classified into “tagged,” the property owners who were given priority, and the “untagged,” or those who had rented or shared spaces with landlords.The Badjaos fell through the cracks as “untagged.”Australian aid grantThree years ago, the Australian government stepped in with a P103-million grant to shelter the Badjaos and help them stand on their feet. The Community and Family Services International implemented the assistance program, in collaboration with the city government, the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and the World Health Organization.The Badjaos originated from Basilan and Sulu, living in houses on stilts along the sea. Over the past decades, the peace-loving nomads have scattered in the region, torn by separatist movements and criminal gangs.Rio Hondo, where the fighting in 2013 was centered, had been a tough slum district through which criminal gangs escaped to the sea after committing atrocities in the city. The area was flattened in the standoff that left 240 people dead. The Office of Civil Defense put the damage at P3.3 billion.On March 2, Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Amanda Gorely traveled to Vale Vista, a resettlement site for 3,400 households, including the 400 Badjao families uprooted from the Rio Hondo area, to officially hand over the projects launched for the sea gypsies and their host communities.Aside from housing, the assistance involved livelihood programs for 1,000 families, assistance in acquiring civil documentation, such as marriage and birth certificates, psychosocial counseling, and health and disease surveillance.Security was tight. Troops in full combat gear and sniper dogs roamed the maze of huts on stilts built around wooden pathways 1.82 meters (6 feet) above black slime strewn with garbage. A drone circled overhead as Gorely, accompanied by City Mayor Beng Climaco, trudged the precarious boardwalk in the 38-hectare area that used to be a salt-making field and mangrove swamp.“I could only imagine the fear and trauma you experienced during the fighting and the hardships after having lost your homes and livelihood,” Gorely said in her remarks during the turnover.While expressing satisfaction that the housing, livelihood support and adult education programs had restored some sense of normalcy and dignity in the community, Gorely also noted the need to provide water, electricity and sanitation services in the resettlement site.Far from idealClimaco admits the situation at Vale Vista is “far from ideal.”“The mud and the slime are still part of the culture of the Badjaos,” she said, noting that they had insisted that they be settled close to the sea where they could earn a living.The mayor also expressed unhappiness at the P2.9-billion Zamboanga resettlement program of the National Housing Authority (NHA), which recently announced it had turned over to beneficiaries 4,000 shelters. Another 2,000 units are still to be completed.“The NHA housing has proven to have some substandard materials,” Climaco said, adding that the permanent shelter residents might become evacuees again.The NHA houses are made of cement and fiberboards, called hardiflex, and iron roofing which, a UN study found, had not been designed according to the Badjaos’ culture and spiritual beliefs. The walls, for one, block the flow of ancestral spirits that give positive guidance to the family.In contrast, the huts built by CRS have latticed bamboo walls and no ceilings to separate the corrugated iron roofing, making the structure airy.The livelihood project, meanwhile, involved an initial cash grant of P10,000 and a second tranche of P8,000. Some 1,000 recipients, including Tausugs and Catholics, underwent counseling and guidance on basic financial management and bookkeeping. The money has been invested in “sari-sari” stores, fish vending and ready-to-wear, among other ventures.Documentation programConsidered a key to mobility, the documentation program allowed the Badjaos to send their children to public schools, qualify for the government’s Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, providing a monthly grant of P1,400 to finance schooling and health care, and eventually access Philhealth benefits.So far, some 2,600 of the displaced have been provided documentation that the uneducated Badjaos had never before bothered to secure. The process stepped up after a computer was donated to the civil registrar in Zamboanga.While optimistic about the security situation—“zero kidnapping, zero bombing in the past two years,” Climaco rued that after Islamic militants rampaged in Marawi City and engaged troops in a five-month standoff last year, the threat to Zamboanga, the main port city in southwestern Mindanao, “will always be there.”But thanks to the literacy program, Adain, a former laundry woman, now knows her 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) and has invested in the fish business. She intends to see her three kids through school.Almalyn Jakaral, 24, a mother of three, is also a graduate of the literacy program. She had attended Grade 1 but learned to sign her name only now.Last month, Jakaral and her family received their marriage and birth certificates. Neighbors happily told them that they could now apply for a passport and become an overseas Filipino Worker.There is genuine appreciation among the Badjaos for the assistance they have received so far as they embark on a new life after the tragic Zamboanga siege.“We escaped after the fighting broke out,” said Jakaral’s husband, Jakaria, 39, a fish vendor. “We were scared. We did not want to get involved.”Now the future looks brighter for the Jakarals in their clean and spare hut.“We came from the bottom, we worked hard. Somehow, we have managed to move up, little by little,” Jakaria said.",1

"Noted social media personality and COMELEC spokesman James Jimenez cited the following examples of ""Filipino honor""...(1) Rido? That's when generations of muslim filipinos actually sacrifice much - even lives - to protect family honor. Also honor driven.(2) Fiesta syndrome? That's when filipinos go into debt to fulfill a social obligation to protect family honor. Perverse? Yes. But honor driven.(3) True story: artist raises 500K in cash for a charity. refuses to touch it for personal gain and scrambles to make 3k for his family. Honor.The question, however is whether these ""examples"" are representative of the overall character of Philippine society. Even more important, we will find that the last two are family- and ethnic/faith-centric. Honour to one's family is easy -- because the motivation to be so is practically ingrained in our DNA as vessels for propagating our genetic code.The bigger challenge is finding evidence of honour that transcends family and religious ties -- as what we can see in TRULY modern societies where all ethnic and religious groups and minorities are treated fairly and respected unconditionally.""In Japan there are very few lawyers and the codes are mostly unwritten, but they are binding, nonetheless."" - Greg Sheridan, *Asian Values Western Dreams*",0
"A presidential fix awaits businessmen having troubles with government transactions.President Duterte has offered to get the permits for businessmen “for free” in case government agencies are unable to process their documents within three days.The President, addressing a recent Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) event at the Manila Hotel, said he and the rest of government officials are all workers of the government are “here to serve the people.”“If your permit goes beyond three days on any table there, just call me and I will get it for you for free,” the former mayor of Davao City said.“Kung meron kang problema dito sa department na ito, tawagan mo lang ako [If you have a problem with a department, just call me]. Call me and I will go to the department concerned, with you together, I will get the papers for you,” he added.Duterte said he would give the business permits “whether it is approved or not.”As head of the executive branch, Duterte said he has supervision and control over government agencies and can “modify or amend” any decision of a Cabinet Secretary.“If you want a faster lane, then call anybody in government,” he told the businessmen present at the PAGCOR gathering.“And I will do it, I said, for you for free. That statement binds all, even the locals,” he said, referring to the three-day processing of business permits.Duterte also promised to grant an audience with businessmen who will report any “serious” corruption complaint against some national or local government officials.He reiterated that he does not tolerate corruption and will continue to weed out misbehaving officials from the bureaucracy.He appealed though to businessmen to do their part in the anti-corruption drive by not giving bribes to officials.He said they should just report any extortion attempt to his office.“We are simply workers of government.

"THE CAMP of Vice President Jejomar Binay on Tuesday belittled the findings of the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee, saying that after 25 hearings it was unable to prove the corruption allegations against Binay.Binay’s political spokesperson Rico Quicho said the final hearing Tuesday “highlighted the obvious’’ as “no credible and admissible evidence has been presented to support the outrageous allegations against the Vice President.’’“The hearings were just a waste of time and resources of the Senate,’’ Quicho said in a statement he issued after the almost three-hour hearing.The Senate subcommittee concluded its hearings Tuesday after more than a year of inquiry into allegations that Binay and his family had amassed illegal wealth through projects and programs under the city government and under him as Vice President.The subcommittee submitted last year a partial report recommending plunder and graft cases against Binay in connection with construction of the Makati City Hall Building II.No-showBinay did not participate in the proceedings of the subcommittee and lashed out against senators for the way they treated witnesses from the city government and certain agencies under him.In a statement, Quicho also claimed that key witnesses, particularly lawyer Renato Bondal and former Makati City Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado, had “no personal knowledge whatsoever on the issue they testified on.’’He belittled Bondal for basing his testimonies “from newspaper clippings from a biased newspaper,’’ in reference to the Inquirer.In the case of Mercado, he said the former vice mayor just retold “lies’’ he had been saying since last year.“The rest of the ‘testimonies’ are just political rhetoric from a vice presidential candidate lagging behind in the surveys,’’ Quicho said of Trillanes.Inquirer reporterQuicho also said Inquirer reporter Nancy Carvajal had no personal knowledge of the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) report containing alleged bank accounts of Binay and his alleged dummies and yet testified on it.“Second, (Carvajal) is in no position to authenticate the document,’’ he said, reminding that AMLC reports were private and confidential and that Carvajal’s possession of a copy was “in clear violation of the law creating the AMLC.’’“Moreover, it has been clearly established in court, based on a manifestation filed by AMLC, that the Vice President has only one bank account and not over 200 as Ms Carvajal irresponsibly claimed, with total deposits of P1.7 million, not billions as she again falsely stated,’’ Quicho said.He said Carvajal and the Inquirer had shown bias in reporting on Binay, lamenting that “sensationalism and exaggeration have been employed once again to bring down the Vice President and raise the ratings of a presidential candidate.’’Evidence against VPBinay’s camp also belied Trillanes’ claim that the folders that the Vice President had presented in a television ad were actually evidence against Binay.Joey Salgado, Binay’s media affairs head, said that the folders were submitted by the Makati City government to show cooperation in the Senate and that the contents showed that “all transactions and projects are transparent and in compliance with established rules and procedures.’’He said senators had admitted they were not able to read all the documents, adding this was not a surprise considering that the senators had prejudged the matter even before the start of the hearings.Salgado also said the photo of folders used in a TV ad of Binay were taken last year and showed these were in a store room “gathering dust.’’ Christine O.

"The remains of a woman and two men “suspected” to be the biological parents of Sen. Grace Poe have been exhumed on Guimaras Island to gather specimens for DNA testing.Cemetery workers as well as family members exhumed the skeletal remains of Victoria Rodriguez and two males at the Barangay East Valencia cemetery in Buenavista town on Wednesday, according to a source privy to the exhumation.Bone samples were taken before the remains were reburied.DNA samples were also taken from nine persons—six Rodriguez family members and three from the family of the “suspected” father on Tuesday.The samples will be taken to Manila to supplement DNA samples earlier taken from three members of the Rodriguez family.Siblings of Victoria Rodriguez have claimed that Poe could be the baby of their sister. They said the baby was brought to Iloilo City and eventually adopted by entertainers Fernando Poe Jr. and Susan Roces.As this developed, the cash reward being offered for information on the possible biological parents of Poe has gone up to P355,000 after a ship captain and a doctor promised to give a total of P55,000 to anyone who can provide “solid” information.Jesus Nograles Rodriguez Jr. (no relation to the Rodriguez family from Guimaras), a retired labor judge who is based in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, earlier offered the P300,000 reward.‘Saddened’Valenzuela Mayor Rex Gatchalian confirmed that the bodies of the members of the Rodriguez clan had been exhumed in order to get DNA samples.He said Poe’s lawyers had “made arrangements for DNA samples to be taken” from the remains of her possible parents.A forensic pathologist hired by the Poe camp “needed more DNA samples,” he explained.Gatchalian said Poe was “saddened” that the remains of her possible parents had to be exhumed just to prove that she is a natural-born Filipino and hurdle the legal obstacles to her presidential candidacy.“I am saddened that it had to come to this just to prove my citizenship,” Gatchalian quoted Poe as saying.The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has ordered the cancellation of Poe’s certificate of candidacy for not being a natural-born Filipino and failing to meet the 10-year residency requirement for presidential candidates.Approached by familyHowever, the Supreme Court issued two temporary restraining orders stopping the Comelec from implementing its two separate decisions disqualifying Poe from the presidential race.According to Gatchalian, the members of the Rodriguez family had approached Poe when she last visited Iloilo and told her that they could be her missing kin.He said the Rodriguezes had “offered for the exhumation of the bodies of Senator Poe’s supposed biological parents.”“The Rodriguez family offered this option because they also wanted to know the truth once and for all,” he said.Gatchalian clarified that the Rodriguez family were communicating and making arrangements with Poe’s lawyers and not directly with her.Latest reward offerMaritime Capt. Eduardo Gargaritano and Dr. Karen Gambito-Galvan were the latest to offer P55,000 for “solid” information on Poe’s parentage.“I know that the amount I am contributing is not much, but this represents my family’s earnest hope that Senator Poe finds the identity of her true parents and perhaps living blood relatives here in Iloilo or wherever they are really from,” said Gargaritano, who is from Guimbal, Iloilo, in a statement.Gargaritano, who is out of the country and could not be reached through his mobile phone and e-mail, is putting up P25,000 while Galvan will give P30,000.“It’s a small amount. I really don’t want to make a big deal about it because we only want to help Senator Poe and put an end to all the questions,” Galvan told the Inquirer in a telephone interview.“Who knows? It’s been a long time already and there’s a need to find closure,” she said.Galvan said she wanted to help Poe because her father, Basilio Gambito, ran for the lone congressional seat of Aklan in 2004 under the ticket of the late Fernando Poe Jr., the senator’s adoptive father.Galvan also ran but lost in Aklan’s gubernatorial race in 2007 under Partido ng Masang Pilipino.In the statement, Galvan said she would suggest that Rodriguez open a bank account where the reward money can be held in escrow.Reached for comment, Rodriguez said he was unaware of the reward offer of Gargaritano and Galvan, and welcomed other voluntary reward offers, but did want to be involved in the collection of reward offers or the opening of a bank account for that purpose.“I’m not accepting donations because I’m not a mercenary,” he said.He said the P300,000 reward he was offering will come from his own pocket and from personal contributions of his six golf buddies.The popular account is that the senator was abandoned and later found in the baptismal font of the Jaro Cathedral in Iloilo City in 1968. She was later adopted by the Poes.The Militar family from Jaro District in Iloilo was earlier believed to be Poe’s biological family, but DNA tests conducted on them turned out negative. ",1
"City Mayor Jefferson Soriano stepped down on Friday, saying he was not going to wait for the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to formally serve the dismissal order issued by the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB).Soriano formally turned over the reins of his office to Vice Mayor Bienvenido de Guzman, who took his oath as the new mayor. Soriano also administered the oath of office to the first-ranked councilor Danilo Baccay as the new vice mayor.The ousted mayor said his lawyers have filed a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals (CA).Earlier, Soriano was ordered dismissed from the service by the Ombudsman, which found him guilty of grave misconduct and abuse of authority in the designation of a transport terminal in this city.Acting on the complaint of Sanny Grace Bangayan, Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales found the retired police official-turned-politician guilty of the administrative offenses of grave misconduct and abuse of authority, perpetually disqualifying him from holding public office and forfeiting his retirement benefits and eligibility.The Ombudsman said the mayor had committed a corrupt act for giving undue advantage to One Way Parking Terminal, Inc. (OWPTI) after he gave the latter a provisional permit to operate the city’s transport terminal.On Dec. 20, 2013, or the very same day he granted the provisional permit to OWPTI, Soriano endorsed to the Sanggunian the application of OWPTI for the operation of the transport terminal.The private firm was allowed to operate the terminal immediately even without seeking a legislative franchise from the Sanggunian, the Ombudsman noted.Soriano “abused his authority and flagrantly disregarded established rule since he put the cart before the horse,” the order read.",1

But on the other hand, it might be a trap that DOJ's opponents have set up.So who's telling the truth?A closer look at the documents shows some rather startling clues.Why is that important? Because the trick here is in the timestamps.The Philippine Star said they got the deposit slips from an unnamed DOJ source, so their story should be an exclusive, i.e. they are the first news outlet to publish this story. The time stamp on the Philippine Star article states ""This suggests that the time difference between the the first version and the second version shouldn't be too long. Why? Because updating an article does not reset the comments section. Surely, if the article was published during the daytime of 01 September 2016, somebody else would've already commented before that Ros Feliciano person.Now, another tell-tale sign is in the hidden data of the graphic used in this article, which is the photo of the deposit slips. It is safe to assume that the photos were already there in the 1st version, and that the update merely affected textual content. Why? Because the photos are the most essential element to make such a leak credible.Now, this is what I did:This is the popup window that I saw:The popup window indicates that the graphic was created at 11:22 PM of September 1st, implying that the original version of this Philippine Star article was published between 11:22PM and 11:59PM of 01 September 2016.According to his Facebook wall, Obuyes denial was posted on Facebook at 4:22 AM of 01 September 2016. Clicking the time stamp on that post shows a different time stamp: 4:22PM of 01 September 2016.Whichever way it goes, it is clear that Obuyes' denial was issued on or before 4:22 PM of 01 September 2016.For the record, this is what Obuyes wrote:I have explained that the glaring spelling and grammatical errors show that it could not have possibly been leaked by DOJ. Aguirre has been successfully defending Duterte since time immemorial and it just goes to show how good a lawyer he is. Moreover, the date stamp 18 April 2014 would have automatically made the evidence invalid, as it was a bank holiday on that day.Duterte eats court cases for breakfast with Aguirre as his metaphorical ""yaya"", so an error as glaring as this is impossible. Aguirre couldn't be that careless. It would have been possible if bar flunker Leni Robredo [ TP: LNMB ] was DOJ Chief , but she isn't.In short, somebody else leaked it, and it's not with Aguirre's permission.With that said, and assuming that Obuyes was indeed interrogated by Aguirre prior to the Star leak, Aguirre could not have possibly showed Obuyes the deposit slips.Why? Because the deposit slips are questionable as it is, and it will just give Obuyes (and by extension, de Lima) more reason to attack Aguirre's credibility.Surely, Aguirre doesn't want that. Bad evidence plus media coverage is bad for DOJ and Duterte.Thus, I cannot help but ask:Now, these questions hinge on the assumption that Aguirre is a decent lawyer. Abad ].Deposit slips as a lead? Yes.But as evidence? No, not really.However, some camps may still argue that Aguirre may have slipped, so I ask:In May 2014, then-President Benigno Aquino III defended Cabinet members named in Janet Lim-Napoles extended affidavit, insinuating that the multiple copies of the list are meant to delay the investigation [ Inq ].The Napoles Pork Barrel Scam has been fraught with controversy, as some of Aquino's cabinet members were implicated in some of the versions of the list. Included in one of the lists was former Budget Secretary Butch Abad, who allegedly taught Napoles how to set up foundations as funnels for pork barrel [ TP: FOI ].In short, the group who leaked multiple ""Napolists"" might be the Liberal Party itself, in an attempt to confuse the public and allow them the opportunity to choose the version which best suits their party's interests.And just recently, Duterte linked de Lima to the same Napoles case [ Star ].This leads me to suspect someone is using the same tactic today.And I have a pretty good idea who it is [ ThinkingPinoy ].Did you like this post? Help ThinkingPinoy stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help!",0
"THE NATIONAL Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has summoned Social Security System (SSS) Chairman Dean Amado Valdez to shed light on an alleged P74-million scam in printing of “document forms” in the National Printing Office (NPO).The NBI clarified that Valdez is not a suspect in the alleged irregularity but considered as a resource person to get his opinion on the alleged double contract awarded to four security printers.Irvin Garcia Anti-Fraud Division (Afrad) chief, issued a subpoena for the SSS chairman and other personalities who could give information on the alleged NPO anomaly.Reports said the NPO already had a P74-million contract with Western Visayas Printing Corp. (WVPC) but it still granted work orders to three printers–Best Forms Security Printer owned by Benjamin Yam, Tri-Print Work of Ramil Tamayo and Metro Color of Celso Viray.In the wake of the reported transactions, NPO Bids and Awards Committee chief Sherwin Prose Castañeda quit his post, along with 10 other BAC officials.The Presidential Communications Operations Office, through Communications Undersecretary for Legal Affairs Enrique Tandan, has found “sufficient basis” to refer the matter to the NBI for further investigation.“The [PCOO] investigation uncovered several irregularities and violations of the Government Procurement Reform Act (Republic Act 9184) and the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (RA 3019), among others,” Tandan said.The NBI had also summoned current and former officials of the NPO.NPO Deputy Director Sherwin Castaneda had denied irregularities in the contract.Ruben Dancel, former chief of Production Planning and Control Division, confirmed that he was asked by Castañeda to cancel the contract awarded to WVPC and award it to the three other printers.The NBI said they are still waiting for Dancel’s affidavit and will investigate if the NPO had given due process for the cancelation of the WVPC contract.Investigators are also probing information that Castañeda was appointed to his post on August 18, 2016 but received compensation from July 1 to August 31, 2016.FRANCIS EARL CUETO",1
"At least 609 members of the communist New People’s Army (NPA) have been “neutralized” by government forces in the countryside with more than 30 firearms recovered for this year, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said on Sunday.As of October 19 this year, 609 NPA members have been recorded as “neutralized” and of the number, 121 were killed in operations, 71 were arrested and 417 surrendered to authorities.Government troops got 331 high-powered and low-powered firearms that were “either surrendered or recovered from the rebels.”AFP public affairs chief Col. Edgard Arevalo said there were 30 more communist rebels who surrendered before authorities.Arevalo added that the latest surrender happened on October 16 in Kalamansig, Sultan Kudarat, wherein five NPA fighters “voluntarily turned themselves” to the Philippine Army’s 57th Infantry Battalion (IB).Three of the surrenderees were identified as Indo Sagpa Aquino alias “Jack”; Losion Samson Masot alias “Mistah”; and Wilden Aquino Salding alias “Kugita.”The three, who came from the NPA Guerilla Front 73, handed over three high-powered firearms to the battalion.“Since Day One of October, the AFP has been facilitating the surrender of more NPA members, some of whom voluntarily handed over their firearms to our troops. This affirms the continuous success of our focused military operations complemented by intelligence and civil-military efforts,” Arevalo said in a statement.For this month, the first recorded surrender was in Arakan, North Cotabato, wherein a “high-ranking” NPA member surrendered to the 39th IB.The “high-ranking” member was identified as Alex Gawelan alias “Banate.”Arakan was the same place wherein suspected members of the NPA ambushed a convoy of the Presidential Security Group in July, an attack that prompted President Rodrigo Duterte to cancel peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines.Other surrenders recorded by the AFP were in Abra, Surigao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, Davao Oriental, Davao del Norte, Compostela Valley, Occidental Mindoro and Cagayan.At least 14 high-powered firearms were collected from the NPA members including M16, M14, AK47 and Garand rifles.According to Arevalo, the military has ben recording the neutralized NPA members since the peace talks were first terminated in February 4.Prior to the cancelation, a total of 20 violent activities were perpetrated by the NPA rebels in January this year alone. The military has also been tagging the NPA members as “terrorists.”Since January, there have been a total of 242 atrocities allegedy committed by the NPA fighters in the countryside.",1
"THE Bureau of Customs (BoC) has started cleansing its list of more than 11,000 accredited importers and customs brokers of misfits and those who have repeatedly violated existing laws and the bureau’s policies and procedures as part of its continuing reform efforts.Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon on Friday ordered the suspension of the accreditation of about 100 Customs importers and brokers who are facing charges for violation of the Customs and Tariff Code of the Philippines, including misdeclaration and undervaluation, among other forms of technical smuggling for the July to December 2016 period.“This is just the beginning. We are still looking into the records of 11,000 others,” Faeldon said even as he assured erring brokers and importers of due process.According to him, those who were suspended have 30 days to appeal their cases and come out clean.All suspensions, revocations and cancellation of accreditation are under the jurisdiction of the Account Manageement Office (AMO), formerly known as the Interim Customs Accreditation Registration or I-CARE.Customs Administrative Order (CAO) No. 8-2007 and Customs Memorandum Order (CMO) 28-2007 state that the imported articles must be described in sufficient detail for proper valuation and tariff classification.Importers and brokers are responsible for enumerating details such as specific product description; make, model, variant and brand; and retail packaging or stock-keeping unit (SKU) in the import entries filed with the bureau.Section 3.5 of Customs Memorandum Order (CMO) 04-2014 states that “the existing accreditation of an importer or Customs broker may be suspended, revoked or cancelled” if there are violations of the ‘Sworn Undertaking’ to strictly abide with existing rules and regulations on the Statement of Full Description of Imported Articles covered by entry declarations.”Faeldon called on importers and brokers to strictly follow the bureau’s rules and policies, warning that he has zero tolerance for corruption and other shenanigans.“It’s either you help us in reforming the bureau or you stop transacting with the bureau,” the Customs chief said.Under CMO 04-2014, all importers and Customs brokers transacting with the BoC should apply for accreditation, except once-a-year importation; importation by parcel post or by informal entry; importation of the Philippine Government, its agencies and instrumentalities; and importation of foreign embassies, consulates, legations, agencies of other foreign governments and international organizations with diplomatic status and recognized by the government, like the Asian Development Bank and the World Health Organization.WILLIAM B.

"the sites of the 2009 Ampatuan Massacre and the 2015 Mamasapano attack.ARMM Tourism Secretary Ayesha Mangudadatu-Dilangalen said these sites of two notorious security incidents are giving them the idea of hosting “hazard tourism” by turning war zones into tourism destinations.Dilangalen said they were surprised that people continue to visit and take photos of the Ampatuan or Maguindanao massacre and the Mamasapano sites.She said the tourism plan would include putting up a tourism center to host visitors.Since the Maguindanao massacre happened in Ampatuan town on November 23, 2009 at the height of the filing of certificates of candidacy (COCs) for the 2010 elections, the area has been frequently visited by people from other provinces and cities.The site is where the mass graves of at least 34 journalists who died in the massacre.On the other hand, Tukanalipao in Mamasapano, Maguindanao was the site where 44 members of the police Special Action Force carrying out a police operation code named “Oplan Exodus”, were killed on January 25, 2015.Aside from the two areas, Dilangalen said they are also proposing to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) to open their camps for tour packages. “People are curious and wanted to see these camps,” she said.“Pero bigyan natin sila muna ng chance (But let’s give them the chance first),” Dilangalen said, adding that this is just a proposal initially offered to the two organizations to give the families of the MILF and MNLF other forms of livelihood.Dilangalen said they would want the MILF or MNLF to take care of the visitors when they are inside the camps.When asked about the response of the two organizations on the proposal, Dilangalen said they were receptive. They are also hoping the cooperation of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the military.“Hindi lang puro offensive (It should not only be about offensive),” she said in an interview after Monday’s Kapehan Sa Dabaw at SM Davao Annex.According to her, the PNP and military’s role in this project is to ensure overall security of all sites.Overall, Dilangalen said ARMM is receiving more visitors year-on year. In 2016, ARMM recorded about three million visitors but the biggest chunk of the arrivals was recorded in Tawi-tawi.Dilangalen said Tawi-tawi’s top destination is the Panampangan Island, which is famous for its powdery sand beach.Tawi-tawi is also known for its rich seafood and for being the seaweeds industry capital in the country.Next month, ARMM is launching the Inaul Festival. Inaul is a Maguindanaon word which means “weaved”. It is a known fabric manually and meticulously woven mostly by Maguindanon women weavers in Mindanao.The Inaul Festival is slated from February 1 to 15.Datu Paul Ampatuan, provincial planning officer of Maguindanao and Inaul Festival Director, said Inaul is a textile of Maguindanao that the provincial government is trying to popularize and make as its icon.Inaul was used during the Mindanao tapestry event for the Miss Universe candidates during their Davao segment recently.Ampatuan said the demand for Inaul fabric is increasing locally and internationally.",1
"SAN FRANCISCO, Agusan del Sur — While admitting he is into the business of hauling ore from mines in his province, the governor of Surigao del Sur on Friday blasted a ranking Catholic Church official for linking the deadly landslides at the height of Tropical Storm “Basyang” (international name: Sanba) to logging and mining.Gov. Vicente Pimentel Jr. said Tandag Bishop Nereo Odchimar “chose to amplify and speculate on baseless and unfounded accusations, instead of helping and comforting the victims” of Basyang.In a pastoral letter he issued on Feb. 17, Odchimar blamed the recent landslides in the province on the disastrous effects of mining. The pastoral letter also called for an investigation of those responsible for the landslides.Denuded mountains“Could the reason be due to massive mining operations that denuded forested mountains and critical watersheds?” the pastoral letter read.Two towns — Carrascal and Cantilan — bore the brunt of the tragedy with scores of people killed.Odchimar also took the provincial government to task for allegedly protecting the interests of mining firms, some of which were believed to be owned by “high-ranking officials of the province.”The village of Babuyan in Carrascal town was directly beneath the area being mined by Carrascal Nickel Co., according to Chito Trillanes of the Social Action Center of the Diocese of Tandag.Feeling alluded toTrillanes said this was among the findings of a 2016 mining audit conducted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, on orders of former Secretary Gina Lopez. He said he represented the Catholic Church during the audit.Saying he felt being alluded to in the pastoral letter, Pimentel denied owning a mining company in either Carrascal or Cantilan.‘Comfortably’ farHe admitted, though, that he was into the trucking business, which services the hauling needs of mining companies. His trucks haul nickel ore from the mining areas.Pimentel also disputed reports that the villages devastated by the landslides and floods in Carrascal were very close to the mining areas. The villages were “comfortably” far from the areas, he said.Odchimar said that during the flooding, heavy current swept logs downstream, becoming deadly projectiles that either destroyed or damaged houses, bridges, village halls and other structures.The people, he said, were demanding answers to why “the flood came so fast and, in some areas, why a number of logs and felled trees were swept downstream, destroying houses.”Hazardous areasPimentel said the villages hit by landslides and flooding had already been identified by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau as prone to landslides and floods.Citing a Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration report, he said Basyang dumped at least 239 millimeters of rain in just seven hours.The amount of rainfall, Pimentel added, was equivalent to a month of continuous rains.“Just like any other flood, running water or surface runoff will bring with it all the debris along its path including uprooted trees, dead trees and logs from ‘kaingin’ system,” he said.Pimentel also denied reports about the collapse of siltation ponds of the mining companies, saying all these facilities were still intact based on the drone videos taken by his men.",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte wrapped up his official visit to Jordan on Friday, a day earlier than scheduled, bringing home $60.675 million in Jordanian investments.This was on top of the $84.9 million worth of investments pledged during his trip to Israel earlier this week.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said President Duterte decided to go home early to be with his family and spare the government another day of expenses.The President shortened the Jordan trip without having to cancel any official engagement, Roque said.New department mulledIn a speech at the Philippine-Jordanian business forum on Thursday, the President promised to create a department that would make it easy for foreign investors to do business in the country.Mr. Duterte assured businessmen here that the Philippines is a good place to invest in but admitted he could not say that the country is “trouble-free.”He pointed out that the “South going back to Indonesia and Malaysia” was where trouble could erupt, referring to Mindanao and the security problems posed by the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters.Still, the President said most parts of the archipelago remained “relatively peaceful” where “business can thrive.”“We need investments. We need the money to finance the huge population in terms of education, medical care, everything,” the President said, giving his audience his “solemn commitment that if you go there, it will be business with ease.”“As a matter of fact, you do not have to travel from one place to another to get a permit or clearance wherever,” he stressed.The President said he would create a department “just to receive your application.”“I will guarantee you the return of profit,” he told Jordanian businessmen. “There will be no corruption. And if you ask anything, even a toothpick, I guarantee you, you can have my audience anytime of the day or night.”9 agreements signedThe President also witnessed the signing of nine business agreements, including seven letters of intent and two memorandums of understanding.The agreements cover the relocation of Nafith International’s regional office to the Philippines; the setup of a manufacturing facility for Dead Sea products for export to Asian markets; the exploration of opportunities for cross-border remittances from Jordan to the Philippines and for genomic testing services for hospitals and clinics.On Thursday, King Abdullah II declared that Jordan and the Philippines were starting a “new era” of cooperation, including a partnership in the fight against terrorism.“I am confident that your presence here will really give us momentum into the future in so many fields, and I believe this is a new era of cooperation,” Abdullah told Mr. Duterte in a meeting at the Al Husseiniya Palace.Abdullah said he looked forward to “an opportunity … to visit your country, not only with our government officials, but also (with) the Jordanian private sector to look at the tremendous opportunities that your country has to offer.”On their shared concerns about terrorism, Mr. Duterte agreed with Abdullah that “it will take a lot more years to stop it.”Jordan on Thursday donated two secondhand Cobra attack helicopters to the Philippines, which will be turned over to Manila after Filipino pilots have undergone a nine-month training on their operation.For his part, the President offered to send troops to Jordan to help combat Islamist militants.Key role in coalitionBoth countries have been battling the influence of Islamic State (IS), with Jordan playing a key role in an international coalition, and the Philippines on alert after a five-month occupation of Marawi City by jihadi groups.“If there is anything that we can do, if you are short in your army, let me know,” Mr. Duterte told his host monarch. “You need one battalion … I will send them to you. I will commit my government in the right side of history.”Abdullah is considered an important Middle East ally of Western powers, with Jordan playing a prominent role in the US-led coalition against IS, providing military, logistical and intelligence support.The President is scheduled to arrive in Davao City at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday after a 14-hour flight from Jordan’s Queen Alia International Airport.",1
"ASuspected Abu Sayyaf gunmen abducted four workers in a school in a southern Philippine province where President Rodrigo Roa Duterte visited troops waging an offensive against the militants, officials said Sunday.About 20 militants barged into a grade school compound in Sulu province’s Patikul town shortly after midnight Saturday and seized six painters and carpenters, one of whom managed to escape and alerted the police. Army troops later rescued another worker.Duterte pinned medals on wounded troops during brief visit Saturday to Sulu, a predominantly Muslim province about 590 miles (950 kilometers) south of Manila. The tough-talking president has ordered government forces to destroy the ransom-seeking militants who still hold several foreign and Filipino hostages in Sulu’s jungles.Fourteen inmates, including suspected Abu Sayyaf fighters and drug dealers, meanwhile escaped early Sunday from a jail in a new building that also houses the police headquarters in a government compound in Sulu’s main town of Jolo, officials said.Three of those who escaped were gunned down by police and another was shot and captured. Army troops were helping police track down the rest with the use of military drones and sniffer dogs, a police statement said.The new kidnappings and jailbreak reflect the diverse security challenges confronting Duterte’s administration in the south, where thousands of troops have been separately battling militants aligned with the Islamic State group who laid siege to Marawi city on May 23.After 55 days of fighting, more than 530 people, including 399 militants and 93 soldiers and police, have died in the violence in the lakeside city, a center of Islamic faith in the southern third of the largely Roman Catholic country.Troops, backed by airstrikes, are fighting less than 100 remaining militants, who are holding an unspecified number of civilian hostages in four Marawi neighborhoods in an offensive that Duterte said last week was winding down and may end in about 10 to 15 days. He said that the offensive won’t stop until the last militant is killed.",1

"An electric vehicle and a quick charging station were turned over to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in Central Visayas by Mitsubishi Motor Philippines Corporation (MMPC) Monday at the DENR compound in Sudlon, Lahug.DENR Regional Director Gilbert Gonzales said the electric car and quick charging station are part of MMPC’s donation to DENR Central in June 2017 that included five Outlander PHEVs, five i-MiEV (electric vehicles) and four quick charging stations.Gonzales said the donation was the result of a memorandum of understanding between DENR and MMPC for a joint study to reduce carbon emissions and strengthen their partnership to promote clean energy and environmental protection in the country.Gonzales said MMPC chose DENR Central Visayas and Davao regions as recipients of the electric vehicles and charging stations. “We will convince other national government agencies and private partners to invest in clean technology to reduce our carbon emissions,” he added.One of the biggest contributors to air pollution in Central Visayas is the rapidly increasing number of motor vehicles in the region, based on data from the regional Environment Management Bureau (EMB).Gonzales lauded MMPC for promoting electric vehicle technology and the use of renewable energy over conventional cars which are highly dependent on fossil fuel that threatens the environment and public health.Gonzales said he is planning educational tours and exhibits so the younger generation can appreciate the government’s efforts in bringing renewable energy to the fore.MMPC President and CEO Mutsuhiro Oshikiri and Executive Vice President for Marketing Department Taichi Nakajima with DENR 7 key officials and personnel attended the turnover ceremony.",1
"Last week, The Adobo Chronicles reported that Hallmark Greeting Cards was sued for changing the lyrics of the Christmas carol,” Deck The Halls” from “don we now our gay apparel” to “don we now our fun apparel” in a Christmas ornament it was selling on the Internet. The copyright lawsuit was brought on by the estates of the composers of the traditional song.Today, the same estates are suing the Robertson family and Duck Dynasty over the family’s newly-released Christmas album. Duck Dynasty is an American reality TV series on A&E. It shows the lives of the Robertson family, who became wealthy from their family-operated business, Duck Commander, operated in West Monroe, Louisiana which makes products for hunters, primarily the duck call named Duck Commander. The show has broken several ratings records on both A&E and cable television as a whole; the fourth season premiere drew 11.8 million viewers, the most-watched nonfiction cable telecast in history.The Christmas album is titled, “Duck The Halls,” which is also the title of one of the songs in the album. In the song, the lyrics “fa la la la la la la la la” were changed to “quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack.”In documents filed with the federal court, the lawyers for the estates said that the new album and song make a mockery of the much-revered Welsh carol penned by their late clients. “It’s a total quackery,” they added.The family is reportedly lining up their ducks right now to face this multimillion lawsuit.Readers can listen to the controversial recording here .",0
"“I’m qualified,” Sen. Grace Poe declared on Wednesday. She said she had not announced her candidacy, but “why are they so afraid of me?”Poe was referring to the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) party of Vice President Jejomar Binay, which seemed to have started trying to derail her candidacy even before she could decide to run for any office in next year’s elections.On Tuesday, Navotas Rep. Toby Tiangco, interim president of UNA, claimed that Poe could not run for Vice President, much less President, because she did not meet the constitutional requirement of 10 years’ residency immediately prior to the election.Tiangco dug up Poe’s certificate of candidacy (COC) for senator in the 2013 elections in which she wrote that she had been a resident of the Philippines for six years and six months.Going by that information, Poe would be a resident of the Philippines for only nine years and six months by election day 2016—six months short of the constitutional requirement.Poe lived in the United States for 13 years and returned to the Philippines after her father, the movie actor Fernando Poe Jr., died in December 2004.Speaking to reporters before the start of the Senate session on Wednesday afternoon, Poe said she wrote in her COC, which she filed in 2012, “six years and six months” because it was only in April 2006 that her US home was sold.But she had proof that she had been living in the Philippines for more than 10 years, she said.Poe said she had been living here since February 2005 and she could prove that, as her children began to go to school in the country in June of that year.She said her family bought a house here in 2005 as a temporary residence while a more permanent house was under construction.“As of today, I exceed the residency requirement,” she said.But why raise the question of her residency when she has not even said she would run for higher office in 2016, she said.“I will answer that if I will file my candidacy,” she said, adding that it was not the question that got her goat.‘Nothing to hide’What made her feel insulted, she said, was Tiangco’s insinuation that she was dishonest.“I have the truth, I have nothing to hide. That’s why I don’t have to hide behind a spokesperson,” she said, clearly referring to Binay, who has long declared his presidential candidacy and makes his aides answer the corruption charges against him being investigated by the Senate.Turning to Tiangco, Poe said: “Perhaps he understands, because he represents Navotas but he lives elsewhere.”Poe said she did not believe Tiangco’s disclosure of her Commission on Elections (Comelec) residency information had no blessing from Binay.“That big a decision had no official sanction?” she said.She disclosed that UNA asked her to run on its senatorial ticket in 2013 then dumped her. She did not say anything then, she said, because she was a newcomer to politics, but she was hurt because those who junked her were her father’s friends.On Sen. Nancy Binay’s statement that she should admit that she would run for a higher office, Poe said she did not know if the Vice President’s daughter was referring to her but she had noticed that those believed to be running for office already had television ads.50 percent surePoe said she was going around the country but was only accepting speaking invitations.She said that whenever people would ask her how sure she was about running, she always answered, “I think 50 percent, but they try to push it to 100 percent.”Poe observed that UNA raised the question of her residency after she signed the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee report recommending plunder and graft charges against Binay.Asked if UNA’s action encouraged her to run, she said: “If that is the kind of people we will elect to office, I think this country will run backward.”Poe admitted that she was a foundling and that to this day she had not learned who her real parents were.She said, however, that she held no ill feelings for her parents because they left her in a church in Jaro, Iloilo province.FPJ and his wife, movie actress Susan Roces, adopted Poe.Too early to sayPoe was asked about rumors that her real mother was her aunt, actress Rosemarie Sonora, and her real father was the late President Ferdinand Marcos.She said she had asked her mother and her aunt about that and they had denied it and she believed them.Answering questions about Poe’s residency, Comelec Chair Andres Bautista said it was too early to determine whether the senator was qualified to run for a higher office.Speaking with reporters in the Office of the Ombudsman, Bautista said candidates for President and Vice President should be residents of the Philippines for at least 10 years, as required by the Constitution.“But at this point, it’s still hypothetical because Senator Poe is not yet a candidate,” Bautista said.“We will act on it once a petition is filed with us. But as I have said, it’s still speculative because the filing of certificates of candidacy is in October,” he said.DomicileFormer Comelec Chair Sixto Brillantes had a more definite answer: Poe could not be disqualified from the presidential election based on her residency status. Her citizenship, however, may be a different issue.“As far as residency is concerned, I believe Grace Poe is qualified, based on the issue of domicile,” Brillantes told reporters.Brillantes explained that the residency requirement in the Constitution referred not to the actual period of residence but to legal residence or domicile.“The Philippines as her domicile is well established since she was born here. The Philippines is her domicile of origin, she is a resident of the country from the day she was born up to now,” said Brillantes, a veteran election lawyer.“The residency referred to in the certificate of candidacy is actually on the domicile, and not the actual physical residence. Domicile means you may not be physically there but there remains your intent to return,” he said.Even if the controversy reaches the courts, Brillantes said, Poe’s COC could not be considered strong evidence of failure to meet the residency requirement.Question of citizenship“What you put in the COC does not really have much weight since the court will look into what is the real circumstance. It will look if one is really a resident and has established domicile for a certain number of years,” he said.But Poe’s citizenship may be a different issue, Brillantes said.A disqualification case may progress once the question of residency is tied with the question of Poe’s citizenship, as she once held American citizenship, he said.In such a case, Brillantes, the election lawyer of Poe’s father, FPJ, said it would be almost inevitable that the issue about her real parents would be scrutinized.“The question will then be, Who is her real father? Even if she was born here but if her father is a foreigner, it means she is also a foreigner. These issues will eventually come up soon,” Brillantes said.He pointed out, however, that it was too early to raise such questions because Poe has not announced that she is running in next year’s election.“You can raise all these issues once she files her COC. That’s the time a disqualification case can be filed against her,” Brillantes said",1
"Ever since the scheme, laglag bala, was exposed at Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), airline passengers have been very creative in protecting their luggage from being targeted by airport personnel suspected of “planting” live bullets in bags for the purpose of extorting money.Many choose to wrap their bags in saran wrap or put all sorts of warning signs and stickers to let airport staff know that they are closely watching their personal stuff.The extortion scheme has created big business opportunities for luggage makers like Australia’s Crumple, a company that manufactures high-end travel bags and accessories.It has created a special-edition anti-laglag bala luggage made of an all-clear polycarbonate shell which hides nothing that’s packed inside the bag. Airport security inspectors need not open the bag to search for prohibited items since they can see all the way through.The new luggage line is especially popular among Filipinos who love to show off their designer clothing, shoes, and accessories.In less than a month after the special luggage was introduced in the market in the Philippines, it sold out and has a huge backlog of orders.But not to worry. A local entrepreneur has invented a new anti-laglag bala luggage — not the same transparent Crumple bags — that scares away unscrupulous airport scammers.The luggage has a life-sized photograph of Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte’s face and upper torso with a message warning schemers that he will let them eat the bullets that they plant in passengers’ bags. The presidential candidate is known for implementing unusual punishment for violators of the law, including forcing violators of the smoking ban to swallow their cigarette butts.The Duterte luggage retails for P4,600 (about US $100). It is also reportedly now on back order.However, an inexpensive alternative is available for those who cannot afford to purchase the Duterte luggage. Stickers bearing the same image and message from Duterte are being sold at the National Book Store for P50 ($1.08). All one needs to do is to attach the stickers to each check-in and carry-on bag.Is this the beginning of the end of laglag bala?",0
"something that could emerge as a point of contention when NATO leaders gather in Brussels next Wednesday and Thursday (July 11-12).Merkel stressed however that “Germany is a reliable partner in NATO”.“We are the second biggest provider of troops, we are participating in several missions and Germany will remain a reliable partner of NATO,” she said.Merkel said “wars are raging on our front door,” listing the Syrian war, Islamic State group militancy, unrest in Afghanistan and the conflict in Ukraine.“To not be prepared for defense of the alliance would be negligent,” she said.",1
"TWO top officials of the Bureau of Immigration (BI) are in hot water for allegedly extorting P50 million from Chinese businessman Jack Lam, the biggest online gaming operator in the country, prompting them to take a 30-day leave of absence to give way to an investigation.The amount was supposedly in exchange for the release of 600 out of a total of 1,316 undocumented Chinese who were rounded up by combined immigration and Special Action Force (SAF) elements in Fontana Leisure Park in Clark, Pampanga for working without permit in the Lam-operated online casino.Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente on Monday ordered Associate Commissioners Al C. Argosino and Michael B. Robles, along with Acting BI intelligence chief Charles T. Calima, to submit their written explanation within 24 hours on the circumstances surrounding the alleged extortion.“This initiative is separate from the NBI [National Bureau of Investigation] [probe] ordered by Department of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre 2nd. We will support this and any other parallel investigation on the matter,” Morente said in a memorandum.“The Bureau of Immigration has been consistent in adhering to the guidance of President Rodrigo Duterte to upgrade the level of service to all our clients and weed out corruption in the bureaucracy. We have taken pains to address all irregularities with impartiality and will continue to take decisive action as needed,” the BI chief added.Argosino and Robles are President Duterte’s fraternity brothers in Lex Taleonis.The embattled officials filed a 30-day leave of absence effective December 12 to give a freehand to the ongoing investigation against them.“In the interest of justice and in our adherence to the Rule of Law and our belief in the truth, we are taking aleave of absence from our duties as Deputy Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration for thirty days effective today, December 12, 2016,” Argosino and Robles said in an official statement.Even as they neither confirmed nor denied the allegations leveled against them, the two maintained that “we fully and wholeheartedly support President Duterte’s war against corruption in government.”The BI spokesman, lawyer Ma. Antonette Mangrobang, has confirmed that 600 of the Chinese have already been released from their temporary detention at the Fontana Convention Center.“They were released after their petitions for bail were approved by the BI Board of Commissioners,” Mangrobang told The Manila Times.The BI Board of Commissioners is composed of Morente, Agrosino and Robles.According to Mangrobang, there are still more than 700 left in detention, with some of them also having pending petitions for bail.Earlier, the Justice secretary disclosed that Lam’s illegal gambling operation in Clark is being protected by a well-entrenched syndicate, which was able to effect the escape of more than 1,000 other undocumented Chinese during the raid in Fontana.Aguirre said Lam does not have a permit to operate from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), which means that he is not paying a single cent to the government.The Justice secretary has disclosed that Lam, through an emissary, retired Police General Wally Sombero, tried to bribe him and Chairman Andrea Domingo of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp.Earlier, a lawyer for Lam has denied Sombero’s role as an emissary nor has the authority to negotiate in behalf of the Chinese businessman.But journalist Ramon Tulfo, in his column last Friday, said it was Sombrero who divulged to him the alleged P50 million payoff, which was paid in two tranches of P20 million and P30 million, at the City of Dreams Hotel and Casino in Pasay City (Metro Manila).The payoff was reportedly captured on CCTV and the whole conversation between the two associate commissioners and Sombero was recorded.The whole transaction, according to Tulfo, was also witnessed by Calima, a retired police general like Sombero.",1
"She was bashed on social media last year for protesting extrajudicial killings and the hero’s burial accorded authoritarian President Ferdinand Marcos during a rally, with netizens describing her and the contingent of students from St. Scholastica’s College as “brainwashed.”But standing up for her beliefs gained Grade 9 student Shibby de Guzman a slot in the list of the “30 Most Influential Teens of 2017” released on Thursday by Time Magazine.The annual list recognizes youth from around the world “across numerous fields” for their “global impact through social media and the overall ability to drive news.”Protesting the “lionization” of Marcos and speaking out against President Duterte was “a risky move,” the magazine said, describing how Mr. Duterte lashed out against the European Union, Oxford University and outspoken critic Sen. Leila de Lima.“None of this has deterred De Guzman,” the magazine noted.In an interview with the Inquirer, De Guzman expressed surprise and excitement over her inclusion in the list, which also cited one of her favorite celebrities, Millie Bobby Brown.‘Right thing to do’“I think that I didn’t really earn my spot, but I did use the opportunity (given me) to do good,” she said. “I just thought that it was the right thing to do.”The young activist said she wanted to make a change and do something about the injustice she was witnessing in the country.“I wanted to spark something inside the minds of those who (are) in control,” De Guzman said, adding that she believes change will “always start with youthful idealism.”In a photo taken from the rally almost a year ago and splashed on social media, then 13-year-old De Guzman was with fellow students during an anti-Marcos protest. The bespectacled teen had a megaphone in hand and a cardboard sign around her neck that said “Lahat tayo posibleng drug pusher (We might all be taken for drug pushers),” in reference to placards found on drug suspects killed in the government’s war on illegal drugs.De Guzman shut down her online critics who said she had been “brainwashed” with this response: “Please do not underestimate the youth. We completely know and understand the injustice we are protesting against,” she wrote.Another Filipino also made it to the list, 19-year-old beauty guru Bretman Rock.Time traced the Hawaii-based teen’s huge Instagram following of nearly 9 million to his “larger-than-life personality.”",1
"SHE MAY have been absent from the second presidential debate on Sunday, but presidential candidate Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago managed to make her views heard loud and clear.The senator, who said she was undergoing a new cancer treatment, joined the televised presidential debate on Sunday through the social networking site Twitter, where she has 2.4 million followers.During the debate, Santiago’s staff posted tweets about her stand on the issues asked of the other four presidential candidates on stage: Vice President Jejomar Binay, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, Sen. Grace Poe, and former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas.OverwhelmingSantiago’s tweets received hundreds of likes and retweets, with her stand on divorce getting the most reaction: 3,617 likes and 3,163 retweets.“The overwhelming social media reaction to staff tweets about the senator’s positions on key issues last night is testament to the effectivity and responsiveness of (her) program of government,” the senator’s media liaison officer, Arveen Patria, said on Monday.“Senator Santiago was not at the debate, but she answered the questions she would have been asked,” Patria continued, adding that the senator’s program of government was available on her website.Supports divorceOn Thursday, Santiago announced that she would skip the second televised debate on March 20 at the University of the Philippines Cebu, because she would undergo a clinical trial for a “new, unnamed anticancer pill.”“I am very sorry to miss out on the debates, but it would be a disservice to the country if I forgo the opportunity to get rid of my cancer completely and strengthen myself further to serve the Filipino people,” said the senator who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2014.While none of the other four candidates supported divorce, Santiago’s staff said she supported it on two grounds: “attempt on the life of a spouse by the other, and adultery or concubinage.”When Duterte and Poe raised their hands in favor of the death penalty, Santiago’s staff tweeted that the senator was “open to the death penalty for drug traffickers. She also maintains that the justice system should be improved.”When Duterte pressed Poe on what she would do if Philippine Coast Guard ships were attacked by China, Santiago’s staff said the senator would “assert Philippine national integrity and will join the Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in facing China.”While Binay, former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas and Duterte tangled over criminality and police supervision of local executives, Santiago’s staff said the senator “wants a leaner, better equipped police force.”Climate changeWhen the debate touched on climate change, her staff tweeted about Santiago’s plans to create “a new department to focus on disaster risk reduction, management and recovery.”While the other presidential candidates promised to lower income taxes, Santiago’s staff said the senator planned to lower income and corporate taxes to 25 percent.Like the other candidates who promised to support a proposed Freedom of Information (FOI) law, Santiago also vowed to certify the bill as urgent, her staff tweeted, adding that the senator had “interpellated on and introduced amendments to the FOI bill at the Senate to improve it.”After the debate, Santiago herself posted the last tweet: “Thank you very much to my volunteers who watched the (debates) in Cebu. Hugs and kisses!”Santiago’s final tweet showed a photograph of her group of supporters in red campaign shirts.She will “try” to participate in the third and last debate set on April 24 in Dagupan City “if the ongoing treatments do not inhibit” her, Santiago said on Thursday.",1

"Thousands of devotees of the miraculous Sto. Niño de Cebu braved the early morning drizzle yesterday and joined the penitential Walk with Jesus procession that officially opens the annual Fiesta Señor.Cebu City Councilor and deputy mayor for police matters Dave Tumulak said an estimated 200,000 people joined in the procession that started at the Fuente Osmeña circle to the Basilica Minore del Sto. Niño at 4 a.m. yesterday.The Basilica will be open for 24 hours every day, with novena masses at 4 a.m. (except for January 5 and 14), 5:30 a.m., 7 a.m., 8:30 a.m.,10 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1 p.m., 2:30 p.m., 4 p.m., 5:30 p.m., and 7 p.m.The 452nd Fiesta Señor carries the theme “Santo Niño: Source of Communion, Protector of Creation.”SECURITY EXERCISEWith the official start of the festivities, the Cebu City Police Office (CCPO) was set to hold another security simulation exercise yesterday afternoon, following last Wednesday’s exercise.During the first exercise, the police simulated a bombing scenario at the Fuente Osmeña and at the Cebu City Sports Complex, where the Sinulog competition will be held.CCPO Director Senior Supt. Joel Doria said the exercise was not announced to generate a more realisitc reaction and response from the public.Indeed, the exercise stirred the public, with some even posting pictures of the simulation on social media and took it as real-life situation.One radio reporter even made a live broadcast without knowing that it was a simulation.“It was good that we were able to gauge the public’s reaction so that we will have an idea of what to do when the real situation takes place,” Doria told reporters.After the simulation, authorities said traffic congestion and thick crowds would be the biggest hindrance for policemen and rescuers in case a bomb explodes in Cebu City during the Sinulog festival.The simulation was conducted jointly by the Cebu City Police Office, the Central Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and related agencies of the Cebu City government.Doria said he was satisfied with the way the police responded, but pointed out that traffic congestion slowed the deployment of personnel.Doria suggested that traffic personnel must man the streets at all times during the Grand Parade.VIGILANCE AND SECURITYFor his part, Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña said “double and triple” security preparations will never be enough.“It’s never enough. It’s scary because the profile of the people who want to create harm is very clearly interested in civilian casualties, not military combat,” he said.He said it will only take one bomb to be detonated in a crowded place to ruin the celebration.The best everyone can do is to be careful and be vigilant, he said.",1

"ELECTION watchdog Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) has cautioned vice presidential candidates Leni Robredo and Bongbong Marcos against declaring premature victory, saying it is sowing confusion as election results have not been finalized.PPCRV chair Tita de Villa said the numbers from both the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and the PPCRV were not conclusive and should not be used as basis for declaring victory.As of 7:45 last night, the PPCRV vote tally reflected 96.13 percent of transmitted election returns (ERs). Robredo had 14,022,932 votes and Marcos had 13,803,842, giving her a lead of 219,090 votes.De Villa said the remaining 3.87 percent of the ERs comprised less than 1 million votes but these “can still alter (election) results.”On Sunday, Robredo told supporters that she had won. She said it was mathematically impossible for her closest rival, Marcos, to catch up with her.“It’s irreversible. We have won,” Robredo said on the campus of Ateneo de Manila University in Quezon City.Hours after Robredo made the declaration, Marcos claimed that he won the vice presidency. “I have won,” he said in an interview with CNN Philippines.The Marcos camp chided Robredo for prematurely claiming victory in the vice presidential race.Official declaration“It is unfortunate that the camp of Congresswoman Robredo is rushing to judgment and engages in self-proclamation based on the unofficial, partial results,” said Abakada Rep. Jonathan dela Cruz, a Marcos campaign adviser.He pointed out that it was too soon to make any conclusion on the outcome of the elections based on unofficial results.The Comelec said the announcement of the winning presidential and vice presidential candidates could come only from Congress.“Congress is tasked by the Constitution to proclaim the winners in the presidential and vice presidential races,” Comelec Chair Andres Bautista said when asked for comment on the declarations of victory by Robredo and Marcos.Congress will convene as a national board of canvassers (NBOC) on May 23 to tabulate certificates of canvass (COCs) to determine the winner of the presidential and vice presidential contests.Wait for final outcomePresidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said it would be better to await the final outcome of the canvassing of votes for the vice presidential race by Congress.“We understand Representative Robredo’s assertion pertaining to the results of the election, as well as Senator Marcos’ reservations on the unofficial poll count. We also note that Congress will soon convene as the NBOC. Perhaps, it is best to await the official announcement by Congress as NBOC on the matter,” Coloma said in a statement.PPCRV can stop countFormer Comelec Commissioner Rene Sarmiento said the PPCRV could now stop tallying votes at 96.13 percent of the ERs, noting that it is unconstitutional to reach 100 percent.Sarmiento said it was the NBOC that was mandated to conclude the election results.“In fact, at 96.13 percent of total election returns tallied, the PPCRV can stop its vote tally,” he said in an interview following his visit to the PPCRV command center in Manila on Monday.Sarmiento said it was still crucial for the PPCRV to monitor the transmission of ERs since the margin of votes for Robredo and Marcos was “indeed very slim.”“But then we have to respect the Constitution. The more than 96 percent is big enough for the total of votes tallied,” he said.De Villa said it was up to the Comelec to determine when to stop giving the PPCRV access to the Comelec transparency server, which transmits ERs.“I am seeking a meeting with Comelec Chair Bautista on this matter,” De Villa said in a separate interview.De Villa earlier in the day said the results of the overseas absentee voting in which Marcos won over Robredo remained partial because the votes transmitted were from 30 embassies and consulates that used the automated electronic system.She said votes from 53 embassies and consulates that conducted manual voting had yet to be transmitted.“The overseas votes reflect 30 countries that used automated elections but we still have more than 50 countries that used manual counting and those results have not been transmitted,” De Villa said.Also, she said some 17,000 to 18,000 votes from areas that held special elections in parts of Mindanao and the Visayas had not been transmitted to the Comelec transparency server. The Comelec declared failure of elections in these provinces after the vote-counting machines did not function in these areas on Election Day.PsywarAsked to comment on the victory claims of Robredo and Marcos, De Villa said: “That is up to them. That is their strategy or their psywar. But I want to caution both parties from claiming victory until it is pronounced.”She dismissed as “outright lie” the allegations from the Marcos camp that the PPCRV and Smartmatic had an unholy alliance that allowed the alteration of the transparency server’s script.

"A 48-second video clip showing President Rodrigo Duterte greeting Andre Gabriel Esteban, his teacher and classmates made the day for an 11-year old “admirer” of the President in California.Esteban, a Grade 6 student, wrote a letter on Oct. 25 requesting the President for a short video clip for his class report on the Philippine leader.The letter which was posted on Facebook by his mother Almyra, came to Malacañang’s attention through Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol.On Saturday, the President’s aide Christopher “Bong” Go posted in his Facebook page Mr. Duterte’s 48-second recorded video clip.“Good day. I would like to say hello to Mrs. Richiutti and her students in Fresno Adventist Academy in California, USA, especially to you, Andre Esteban. Andre, I received your letter request, and I am most happy to oblige,” said Duterte, who recorded the video from his home.“I am sure that you will do (a) great report about our beloved country, the Philippines. Continue being a good son and study well and may God bless you and your family and all of us in this planet Earth,” he added.Esteban wrote that he greatly admired the President and wanted to talk about the Philippine leader for his “nationality report” in class.“Dear President Duterte, My name is Andre Gabriel Custodio Esteban from Fresno, CA, USA. I am 11 years old and in 6th grade at Fresno Adventist Academy. I am a proud Filipino and I really like you as our president and I wish to meet you someday,” the boy wrote.“I am doing a Nationality report about the Philippines on Nov. 15, 2017. I am interested in talking about you in my class. I know that you are very busy because you are hardworking president. I admire you greatly,” he went on.“But can I ask you a special favor? Can you please send me a short video clip of you saying hello to my teacher, Mrs. Ricchiuti, my classmates, and I? Maraming maraming salamat po! God bless you po! Sincerely, Andre,” he ended.",1
"The main problem is that Filipinos in general have given up hoping that they some day will be blessed with an honest administration which would be able to work for the people.It is true that The Philippines call themselves a democracy but that is probably because they do not fully understand what a democracy really is.One of the most important principles in a democracy is that the people elect the members of a parliament and that means that everybody in parliament become CIVIL SERVANTS which again means that these people are elected by the people, for the people. Taking that principle to its extreme it is fully legal in a real democracy to call the president or prime minister IDIOT. You can by nature attack the position but not the person. Hence, you cannot call the president or prime minister a traitor etc.The principle in a real democracy is that you have walls between your branches. The government cannot instruct the courts about how to carry out their function, nor can the courts instruct the police how to carry out their function.In a real democracy, the armed forces are kept in a box and if a military person is caught outside a base with a fire arm that person will be arrested by the police and convicted by a civilian court. That is a true democracy.I grew up in a country where we during The Cold War had the largest amount of military hardware ever assembled standing almost at our doorstep but I still never saw the military at all unless a column of military trucks and tanks were escorted by the police going from a military base to a shooting range.These are principles and a level of discipline that simply do not exist in The Philippines and the reason for the problems in The Philippines is related to the absence of those principles.The Philippines have a lot of natural resources. The people in general can be very resourceful but due to the culture of corruption and incompetence no positive change never really seem to materialize and that is sad.Once upon a time before the reign of Ferdinand Marcos, The Philippines were the second largest economy in South East Asia and did really well.Since Marcos, that way of life was forgotten and the country has since then been floating around in the bottom of the barrel in South East Asia so to speak.----------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"Manobo Datu Ben Tindogan is worried about what will happen to his people after they lose the royalty share from mining companies operating in their ancestral lands.“What will happen to our children if they lose their scholarships? What do we do if we lose our livelihood?” Tindogan asked after Environment Secretary Gina Lopez ordered the closure of 23 mines on Feb. 2 for damaging watersheds.Fourteen of the mining companies facing closure are located in the Caraga region.Lopez ordered five other mines suspended.On Tuesday, she canceled 75 contracts for undeveloped mines.Indigenous peopleTindogan’s family is among the 155 indigenous families that will be adversely affected by the closures.The families get livelihood assistance and 160 of their children get full scholarships from the mining companies.But with the closures, they will lose all of those benefits and, worse, the royalty share—equivalent to 1 percent of the gross sales of the mining companies—for operating in their ancestral lands.In January alone, royalty payments in Caraga amounted to over P270 million, paid by 10 mining companies whose operations are within the indigenous peoples’ lands.The Caraga mining sector—currently the Philippines’ biggest, with 24 large-scale gold and nickel mines—directly employs 16,090 regular workers, according to the regional office of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB).The closure of the 14 mines in the region will push all of those workers out of their jobs, affecting their families, and displace the workers at mine suppliers, subcontractors and local businesses that cater to the mining companies.300,000 affectedTaking into account the indigenous communities that would lose their royalty share, MGB-Caraga Director Roger de Dios and Dulma Raagas, president of the Chamber of Mines-Caraga Region Inc., said the total number of people to be affected by the closures would reach more than 300,000.“We’re not talking yet of lost taxes for local governments that derive the bulk of their revenue from mining operations,” Raagas said.On top of the business and real property tax and regulatory fees that go directly to local coffers, local governments hosting mining companies enjoy a 40-percent share in the 2-percent excise tax paid by the miners on their annual gross revenue, Raagas said.Records at the MGB regional office showed that from 2013 to 2015, revenue from excise tax in the Surigao and Agusan provinces alone amounted to P2.1 billion.EcotourismThe Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) believes ecotourism can make up for the lost mining revenue.In the news conference on Tuesday where Lopez announced the cancellation of 75 mining contracts, Environment Undersecretary for Field Operations Philip Camara presented the DENR’s plans for a “green economy” in areas where mines would be shut.“The most immediate thing that can be done is to start to revegetate the mined-off areas, which is in the mining law,” Camara said.He said every 200 hectares of revegetated areas would generate up to 1,000 livelihoods earning up to P7,000 a month, “which matches the average salary of a mine worker.”The DENR plans are oriented toward ecotourism, which Camara said could generate “high-quality jobs” and “multiply” into agriculture and biodiversity that could be tapped for “health and wellness products.”“We can clean up silt and protect the corals, [build] marine sanctuaries for better fish catch,” Camara said.For forested areas, “we see potential in the sustainable harvest of timber, coal, resins,” he added.The DENR also hopes to generate community enterprises for biochar and charcoal briquettes, he said.Justice servedOne of the mining contracts ordered canceled by Lopez was for the Canadian Altai Philippines Mining Corp. in San Fernando town on Sibuyan Island, Romblon province, where an opponent of mining was shot dead in 2007.For the Bayay Sibuyanon group opposed to mining, the cancellation of Altai Philippines’ contract means justice for the death of Armin Marin.“Justice will finally be attained after 10 years since the death of our colleague, Armin Marin,” Bayay Sibuyanon head Rodne Galicha said on Wednesday.In Batangas province, church and environmental groups also lauded the cancellation of the contract of the Canadian-Australian venture Egerton Gold Philippines Inc.The company ended its exploration in 2012 and was seeking permit to extract gold in the 20,000-ha site in Lobo town.",1
"Ninety-three percent of the elected officials in this province, led by Governor Francisco Emmanuel “Pacoy” Ortega III, joined the other day President Duterte’s Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban).Ortega, along with other incumbent officials, nearly filled the Eriguel Covered Court, here, where they pledged allegiance to their new party on Thursday.House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, who is the PDP-Laban secretary general, officiated the oath-taking ceremony for the administration party’s new members who included 18 of the 20 mayors in the provinc; incumbent provincial board members; vice mayors; city and municipal councilors, and other local politicians.“This only shows that most of our local leaders in the provinces are supporting the President’s agenda and his programs for our country,” Alvarez said.Most of the new PDP-Laban members in La Union bailed out from the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) and the Liberal Party (LP).PDP-Laban National Executive Director Glen Badon said that the party is “now super strong because almost all the political leaders in the provinces have joined the administration party.”Asked why this was so, Badon said the new party members expressed that they want to help in the President’s advocacy of good governance.“PDP-Laban will support the main objective of the administration of Federalism. We fully support all the government’s agenda for the good of the country,” Badon said.It was learned that La Union 2nd District Representative Sandra Young-Eriguel and 1st Rep. Pablo C. Ortega were the first officials to join the party right after the elections in May, 2016.“In line with our goals to help and serve our constituents, we join the party of our President because we want to support his plans and programs for the progress of our country and our locality,” said Rep. Eriguel, PDP-Laban district chairman.The oath-taking coincided with the Congressional Caravan where members of the House of Representatives are conducting assessment on various projects, especially infrastructure, in northern and central Luzon.",1
"Indonesian militants planned to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb, security sources said, highlighting the rising ambitions of extremists to wreak destruction in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation.But experts cast doubt on their expertise, equipment and chances of success.The plot was foiled when police raided homes and arrested five suspects in Bandung, West Java, last week, the sources with direct knowledge of the plot said. After the raids, police spoke of a plan to explode a “chemical” bomb but provided no other details.The plot comes as Indonesia grapples with an influx of militants deported from other countries and the fallout from the Islamic State-led siege in the southern Philippines city of Marawi that regional leaders and analysts worry has energized militants across Southeast Asia.The three counter-terrorism sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the militants had hoped to transform low-grade radioactive Thorium 232 (Th-232) into deadly Uranium 233 (U-233).The highly radioactive uranium would be combined with the powerful home-made explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP) to create a “nuclear bomb,” according to an instruction manual used by the militants and reviewed by Reuters.In fact, the device would be, at best, a radiological dispersal device or dirty bomb that could spray radioactive material when the conventional bomb exploded.A spokesman for Indonesia’s national police, Inspector General Setyo Wasisto, declined to confirm or deny the plot to construct the device, but said it would have been more potent than the two bombs made from TATP that killed three police in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta in May.“If this bomb was finished, it would have had a more destructive impact than the bomb made from ‘Mother of Satan’,” he said, using the nickname for TATP.“It could burn anything and make it hard for people to breathe.”Thorium-232 can be transformed into Uranium-233 but requires the Thorium to absorb a neutron, a process that needs powerful irradiation, generally from a nuclear reactor, according to three analysts contacted by Reuters and the website of the World Nuclear Association, which represents reactor vendors and nuclear engineers, among other industry stakeholders.The militants’ manual advised an X-ray machine or microwave be used instead.“X-rays would not have enough punch to overcome the binding energy of the Thorium atoms,” said Peter Hayes, an expert in radiological devices from the Nautilus Institute, in an email.“And, no, you can’t cook Th-232 to make U-233 in a microwave and, if you could, you would have a painful and rapid death from the radioactive nature of the co-present U-232 produced alongside U-233.”One senior Indonesian counter-terrorism source said the Bandung-based cell had bought a large amount of a household item and had begun to extract the Thorium. Reuters has chosen not to name the item.“They needed three weeks. It was still only one week (into the process when police raided),” the source said.According to police, the suspected Bandung plotters were members of JAD and were considering targets like the presidential palace in Jakarta and police headquarters in Bandung and the capital.Two of the five suspects are Indonesian migrant workers deported from Singapore and Hong Kong this year for posting radical Islamist material on social media.They spent a month or less in a deradicalization shelter before joining up with the other militants, sources told Reuters.About 177 Indonesian militants have been deported from other countries this year, according to Adibrata, citing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",1
"Efren Gonzales almost lost the ability to walk as a kid, after he was afflicted with a rare form of bone tuberculosis.A decade or so later, however, the teen from Cabangan town in Zambales province, is training to compete as a national athlete.At 19, Gonzales has already competed in the Palarong Pambansa, the country’s oldest collegiate league. Years ago, he represented Region 3 in the 3,000-meter steeplechase event in track and field. This time, he is busy preparing to compete in longer distances.The turnaround is the stuff of telenovelas. In fact, in 2016, a long-running drama program on Philippine TV took notice and featured Gonzales’ inspiring story.“My life story is really dramatic, what can I say?” said the plucky athlete in the vernacular.The long walkTo get to where he is, Gonzales had a long journey—literally. The youngest in a brood of six, he remembered scorching days perched on top of his father’s shoulder while he was being physically transported to school.Thanks to his parents’ unflinching support, he said dealing with his crippling condition became a little bearable.Things began to look up when a social worker from World Vision referred the family to a bone specialist. World Vision had helped support Gonzales’ schooling since he was in grade 1.Then began a long, often difficult process of medication and therapy, an ordeal that eventually gave way to reprieve as Gonzales slowly regained strength in his legs.This newfound strength and youthful audacity gave the then grade 5 student the confidence to pursue his interest in running, making up for the lost time when his legs failed him. His parents did not approve, as the memory of their child’s frailty was still fresh in their minds.“But I became a very active child, and I persisted,” Gonzales said.It was also then when he realized that competitive running, aside from giving him an adrenaline high, could also be his ticket to a brighter future.New mobilityOn his last year at junior high at Cabangan National High School in Zambales, Gonzales gained a different sense of mobility. In 2013, he became one of the 509 students from Zambales and 5,000 from all around Asia to become beneficiaries of the ING Orange Bike Project that was piloted in the Philippines.Spearheaded by ING Bank, the Asia-wide initiative targets boosting the performance of school children from remote areas by helping them get to school in a safer and more enjoyable way. Launched in 2013, the ING Orange Bike Project aims to sponsor 5,000 bicycles over five years for kids who walk long distances to get to school, according to the project’s website. In addition to getting to school faster and safer, the project also hopes to improve school attendance and academic performance, giving the children and their families a chance for a better future. To date, about 3,200 bikes have been given to children in the Philippines (1,200), Indonesia (1,000) and Thailand (1,000), the website added.For Gonzales, the 7 kilometers between his house and school was a course he dreaded daily.“It used to take me an hour if I walked,” he said. “I could also take the tricycle, but it cost P10 per trip and there were days, up to twice or thrice a week, when I simply couldn’t go to school because I had no fare money.”The bike provided by the ING Orange Bike project enabled him to go to school faster and thus propelled him towards his dream: to finish high school and go to college, Gonzales said. The project also enabled him to improve his performance in class. He even finished junior high with academic distinction, in addition to winning in various regional athletic meets.One rationale behind the Orange Bike project is to mitigate the effects of the long journey to school on a child’s attendance and academic performance, said Teresa Cuzamo, a volunteer from World Vision, one of ING Bank’s partners in the project.The Zambales project was monitored for three years and, as of the first semester of the third year, the student beneficiaries were able to improve their class attendance by 91 percent; of this group, 72 percent had improved their academic grades.Lucky streakGonzales’ lucky streak continued when his high school trainer, impressed by his athletic ability, referred him to a coach at Arellano University in Manila, which competes in the prestigious National Collegiate Athletics Association.“It sounded too good to be true, to be honest,” he said. “Imagine, free tuition and other benefits, which meant I could go to college without burdening my parents.”The training package came with a scholarship plus dormitory and meal allowance. His parents (his father is a farmer and his mother a barangay health worker in Zambales) eventually realized that it was Gonzales’ way of chasing his dreams.“I told them, I want to finish school to repay them for all their hardships when I was growing up. They really did everything for me. Like I said, I owe them everything,” a grateful Gonzales said.Whenever he takes stock of his life story, Efren said it was no longer the disease and the pain that he remembers. As a long-distance runner, he had always believed that life is not a sprint but a marathon, in which endurance is key.While he knew it was his dogged persistence that moved him closer to the finish line, Gonzales said it was the support he enjoyed from his family, as well as from institutions like ING Bank and World Vision, that propelled him toward fulfilling his dream.",1
"On July 20th, AirAsia Philippines announced that it would give free baggage allowance of up to 40 kg plus in-flight meals and snacks for Armed Forces personnel assigned to peacekeeping missions.“I am blessed to somehow help them with their luggage, and that was a little thank you for the bigger job they are doing.

Lives lost. More from the enemy’s side, reportedly. The number is expected to rise in the coming months because President Duterte has called on the Philippine Military to wipe out the Abu Sayyaf. But is it enough? Déjà vu… Lives lost… Because… Duterte… called on… the… Military… Yes, Alindogan blamed Duterte for the deaths in the operations versus the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. Is Alindogan high on Rugby? Does she expect the government to do nothing?Ano, yan, Jamela, may masulat lang?Of course, she got her fair share of acerbic and extra spicy rebukes from netizens over that stunt.I can only see two possibilities at this point:Alindogan is so stupid that she had to commit the same mistake twice, or, Alindogan is such a famewhore that she needs to court controversy by unnecessarily provoking the grieving public then pulling out the victim card in response.Alindogan won't admit number 1, so so we are left with number two.Hence, let's ask, why did Jamela bother posting such stupidity?Alindogan wants another Swedish Award? Does Alindogan want another Swedish Foreign Ministry award?Given a few months after her insipid Abu Sayyaf post, theI do not understand how taunting the public with mind-boggling callousness qualifies as “providing citizens with information needed to make enlightened decisions”.

So, will this tsunami of criticisms earn her another Swedish Award?Pathetic. Alindogan can say that the Swedish think she's a great person, but can she say the same about the Filipino people?And before you say that I do nothing, my readers and I have already donated P35,000 to the AFP Education Benefit System Office, the agency that helps send soldiers' orphans to school. I sent the amount a few days after the Marawi Clash commenced.There are many Filipinos who are trying their darned best to help in their own way.And there's AirAsia, arguably the country's lowest-cost low-cost carrier, sacrificing part of its razor-thin profit margins just to support to our troops. Some bought and wore #SupportOurTroops shirts to boost troop morale. Some have sent relief goods to evacuation centers. Some changed their social media profile pictures to show support.Here we are, trying to make sense out of the destruction and misery brought by war, and there is Jamela Alindogan, being stupid, as usual.Jamela, the Excess BaggageI find it ironic that this entire thing stemmed from the issue of excess baggage. ""Excess baggage""Alindogan qualifies as excess baggage: her commentaries, both unnecessary and unwanted, have become burdensome because of her relative visibility, thanks to her affiliation with a major news outfit.I am not against journalists publishing casual posts, but I am against journalists publishing casual posts with little regard for those who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of this nation.Jamela, you’re stupid and a pathetic award from Sweden does not make you any smarter. also serves as an idiom for “any person or thing that is unnecessary or unwanted and thus is or becomes burdensome.”Alindogan qualifies as excess baggage: her commentaries, both unnecessary and unwanted, have become burdensome because of her relative visibility, thanks to her affiliation with a major news outfit.I am not against journalists publishing casual posts, but I am against journalists publishing casual posts with little regard for those who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of this nation.I would like to believe that you have a mental disorder, but I do not want to offend those who genuinely suffer such conditions.Regardless, Jamela, get tested, please.P.S.

"Kosovo’s northern Mitrovica region for Serbia’s Presevo Valley.The Serbian government official in charge of overseeing the Kosovo Serb-populated territories in the former province, Marko Djuric, said Friday in Belgrade that Kosovo Albanian officials “can only dream” about gaining any part of Serbia in the negotiations.“They have this maddening dream, those crazy territorial pretentions,” said Djuric, announcing a visit to Kosovo by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to the Serb enclaves on Sept. 8-9.Thaci told The Associated Press on Aug. 1 that there would be no “division, but a correction of borders” that could possibly make the Presevo Valley a part of Kosovo. He didn’t say whether that would involve a trade of northern Mitrovica, where the majority of Kosovo Serbs live.But Haradinaj wrote on his Facebook page Friday that “continuous public debate on border re-designing and a land swap is an invitation for new tragedies in the Balkans.”“We have paid a high price for peace we enjoy nowadays and we wouldn’t like to enter into dangerous scenarios to restart a new NATO intervention,” said Haradinaj.Kadri Veseli, parliamentary speaker and leader of the main Democratic Party of Kosovo, also opposed any land swap saying that “Kosovo’s territorial integrity is sacred.”Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said that it’s up to Belgrade and Pristina to decide.“I believe it’s up to them to establish what might be the elements of an agreement,” he said. “It’s not up to the European Union to provide guidelines on what should be in it. We are trying above all to support their discussions.”Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor-Viorel Melescanu agreed, saying that once the two reach a clear understanding, this would “help us very much, other countries who have not recognized Kosovo, to arrive at a final decision about it.”Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic said only that his country is committed to finding a compromise, “but we’re not sure yet when it is going to happen.”The presidents of Serbia and Kosovo meet in Brussels on Sept. 7 to continue the negotiations.",1

"Anti-Duterte retired entertainer Jim Paredes was deported back to Australia at dawn this morning. But it was all in error.The Bureau of Immigration (BI) arrested Paredes and put him on the first available flight from NAIA to Sydney.Apparently, overly-eager BI employees mistook Paredes as the Australian who was reported to be engaged in anti-government activities in violation of the Philippine Constitution. Foreign citizens are expressly prohibited to engage in such activities while in the country. Paredes holds Australian citizenship.The real Australian concerned in the report turned out to be a 71-year-old nun, Sister Patricia Fox.As he was being escorted to his plane, Paredes kept on shouting, “Look at me, look at me.

"Supt. Marvin Marcos is presumed innocent until proven guilty in court, according to chief presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo.Panelo spoke to reporters a day after senators insisted on the prosecution of Marcos for murder instead of homicide, as the Department of Justice had recommended, in connection with the killing of Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. of Albuera, Leyte province, in November 2016. This allowed Marcos to post bail and return to service.President Duterte has tagged Espinosa as a drug lord in Eastern Visayas. Espinosa was detained on drug charges at the Leyte subprovincial jail in Baybay City when he and another inmate were gunned down in a predawn warrant raid by a police team led by Marcos on Nov. 5 last year“The problem is, ever since, which is a wrong concept and wrong application, our country never observed the constitutional presumption of innocence,” Panelo said on Thursday.Marcos is back in the Philippine National Police as regional director of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group.He is likely to be promoted to senior superintendent after six months, according to senators who suspected that the PNP is coddling Marcos and his cohorts and covering up what they had done.“I think the promotion will be done if you do something new, not because you had killed someone. In the first place, we don’t know if he’s the one who killed [Espinosa] or not. Nobody knows what happened there,” Panelo said.“That’s precisely why they were being charged, because that’s the speculation. You have to prove that in court beyond reasonable doubt,” he added.Asked about the likelihood of promotion for Marcos, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said: “It’s better to just let him do his job first and perform, and see if there is any veracity for the new assignment. So it’s really quite premature [to comment],” Abella said in a press briefing.According to Panelo, the problem was that people treat those facing charges as if they had already been found guilty.He defended Marcos’ reinstatement.“What happened was they have judged him guilty. Everyone has become biased. That’s the problem,” Panelo said.“What the President is saying, why can’t I reinstate him when we’re paying his salary? Besides, there is the presumption of innocence,” he added. But should Marcos be found guilty, he said the President would not tolerate him, he added.On Thursday, Sen. JV Ejercito expressed hope that Marcos would go on voluntary leave.He said in a tweet to reporters that Marcos had become a “liability … too hot to handle” for the PNP.Sen. Panfilo Lacson, chair of the committee investigating Marcos, said what Ejercito suggested was “a waste of time.”“He shouldn’t have accepted the assignment in the first place if he had the wisdom and sensitiveness to save his superiors and the PNP as an institution from criticisms,” Lacson said of Marcos.",1
"“Fear is a clear indication belying what the government has been trumpeting all along that people now feel safe to roam around because policemen are weeding the streets of thugs and drug users and pushers.”Fr. Jerome Secillano summed up on Monday the reaction of critics of President Duterte’s war on drugs following the release of a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey that showed eight out of 10 Filipinos feared that they, or people they know, could become victims of extrajudicial killings associated with the bloody campaign.The parish priest of Nuestra Señora del Perpetuo Socorro Church in Manila said he hoped the survey would trigger a “massive public expression of indignation” against Mr. Duterte’s relentless drive that had so far claimed 6,000 lives.Getting out of hand“We really need to worry about the killings even without the survey results. Lawlessness is getting hold of the country and it is getting out of hand. The government is no longer in control,” said Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo.Commission on Human Rights Chair Jose Luis Gascon called on the administration to pursue its anticrime efforts “with full respect for human rights standards and due process guarantees.”“Human dignity is far too important a matter to disregard whatever might be the public opinion about the Duterte administration’s war on drugs,” he said.Sen. Francis Pangilinan said “fear for one’s safety is bound to surface” given that statistics also showed that since the Duterte administration came in on July 1, someone got killed every 40 minutes every day.“The poll results are proof that people do not feel safe in the streets. The only way to address this is to stop the daily killings,” Pangilinan said in a text message.State-inspired killingsSen. Antonio Trillanes IV said the SWS survey “basically debunks the Duterte administration’s propaganda line that our people feel safer now than before they assumed power.”Sen. Joel Villanueva said the killings “should be a cause of concern and the recent survey is the affirmation of that.”“It is time for all of us, especially the government to reconsider other options,” Villanueva said.With some of the dead being innocents, Sen. Grace Poe said it was understandable there was “fear in the hearts of our countrymen.”“This fear is further fueled by the apparent inaction against the police officers involved in several questionable murders of unarmed victims, almost making these state-inspired killings,” Poe said.Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian said many people were “worried about the lack of due process” and urged the government to “quickly show the public that it is making extra efforts to investigate all the deaths.”“It should also start reforms in our judicial system to improve the pace of prosecution of drug-related cases, otherwise, the fight against illegal drugs will be short-lived,” Gatchalian said.Sen. Leila de Lima said in a speech at the annual conference on cultural democracy in Berlin on Sunday that she was disturbed that there was no expression of outrage among Filipinos on the daily drug-related killings.“Whereas I used to think that we, Filipinos, have long learned our lessons about the folly of falling for authoritarian rule under a charismatic and dangerous cult-like leader, I myself am not so sure why we are in this situation once again,” De Lima said.She lamented that the country elected in May “a self-confessed serial killer as President.”Perpetually paranoid“We have gotten to the point where we are trying to convince ourselves that we do not hear what we are hearing; that we do not see what we are seeing; that it’s OK for the President to do and say what he does and says because he is just being true to himself, and that’s a good thing; that to speak against the President is to stand against the 16 million who voted for him,” De Lima said.Sen. Gregorio Honasan II said the killings were “something to be concerned about but we cannot be paralyzed into inaction.”“What do we do about it? We just cannot leave it on the shoulders of the President or the current government. It takes a nation to raise a child. Unless we get involved say in our homes, in our schools, nothing will happen. We’ll be perpetually paranoid and worried and concerned,” Honasan told reporters.He said he wanted to look at solutions. He also said the drug problem was a global problem and that extrajudicial killings were also happening in other countries.Sen. Vicente Sotto III said the survey results proved “there are many people involved in drugs and they know it.”Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin said: “When each of us don’t feel safe and worried that death will come to someone we know and love, it means that we are losing the war on drugs. We are losing not just our peace of mind but perhaps our own humanity.”",1
"Senator Tito Sotto received criticisms from the Netizens after his controversial remarks to Department of Social and Welfare Development (DSWD) Secretary Judy Taguiwalo Wednesday.During the hearing of Commission of appointments, Sotto asked why the DSWD Secretary if she’s a single parent and when Taguiwalo confirmed it, the senator made the controversial remark that offended many netizen.“when you have children and you’re single ang tawag diyan na-ano lang,” Sotto said during the hearingMany solo parents were offended by the remarks of Sotto and even the DSWD Secretary gave a little lecture to the senator during their face-to-face in the senate.“I teach women’s studies in UP. We respect all kinds of families, and that includes solo parents,” Taguiwalo told Sotto.In anger, the netizens especially the single parents didn’t resisted to criticize Sotto’s ‘tasteless’ remarks.They reminded the Senator to become sensitive next time in making remarks about solo parents.Even the Netizens dragged the name of Ciara Sotto the daughter of the senator who is also a single parent. They made memes of Ciara together with her child reminding Sotto that her daughter is also a solo parentBut some people urged the people to stop dragging Ciara Sotto in the issue and also respect her as solo parent.",0
"Democracy stands for freedom. So essentially, “freedom from democracy” entails liberation from the clutches of freedom. Now why has freedom become fetters that keep the Philippines a struggling third-rate dirt-poor country amidst economic tigers in the region? Well democracy is actually a double-edged sword. While it gives us the benefit of that cool ecstatic feeling of liberation and independence which our forefathers have struggled and fought for, it carries with it a huge responsibility, one which Filipinos have proven themselves to be incapable of handling.Democracy (which the West has painted to be the be all and end all) has failed us. The fact that there is no publicly available train ride to the city center the moment you step out of the airport lobby is sufficient proof democracy in this country does not work to our advantage! Democracy only works for mature advanced societies. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution. You need to match it with the stage of evolution a given people are at. For a people who are in many ways a century behind in terms of basic common sense and moral fortitude, sad to say – Filipinos are simply not ready.Now it may be just a matter of time that Duterte will reach the end of his tether and take Option B: set up a revolutionary government. Signs were very telling at the onset of his presidency that he was looking into the speedy option of overthrowing the current corrupt system to effect lasting change. He went all over the country visiting military detachments and seeking to win the hearts of our men-in-uniform first. The PNP and AFP are his tools to bringing about many bleeding-heart freedom-loving Filipinos’ worst nightmare: rapid change through a totally new government. Note: Whoever gains the trust of the armed forces can practically do anything – even abolish Congress and the Supreme Court if he so wishes.In the name of checks and balances, the current system is simply rigged and designed to hamper rapid progress. Just look at how the appointment of the efficient and effective head of DSWD was rejected by the CA. How can a country advance when we have power- and wealth-hungry politicians placing hurdles left and right? Congress’ recent rejection of erstwhile DSWD secretary Judy Taguiwalo rings out as “strike three!” on this corrupt body’s confidence on the president’s ability to make wise choices. At this point, Duterte can simply turn the tables around and strike Congress out!Alternatives to Liberal DemocracyNow that we know that the current brand of democracy is detrimental to Filipinos, what should we do? An alternative solution is not difficult to find (from Wiki)…A benevolent dictatorship is a theoretical form of government in which an authoritarian leader exercises absolute political power over the state but does so for the benefit of the population as a whole. A benevolent dictator may allow for some economic liberalization or democratic decision-making to exist, such as through public referenda or elected representatives with limited power, and often makes preparations for a transition to genuine democracy during or after their term. It might be seen as a republican form of enlightened despotism.Lee Kuan Yew (Singapore) was one of these so-called benevolent dictators.Lee Kuan Yew: Known to be the man who transformed Singapore from a poor agrarian society into one of Asia’s wealthiest nations, Lee Kuan Yew is often called a ‘benevolent dictator.’ As a leader who was in power for thirty-one years from 1959 until 1990, he implemented some laws that were deemed to be autocratic, and attempted to dismantle political opposition. Despite this, he is often looked upon favorably for his transformation of Singapore, and is considered by many to be one of the most successful political pragmatists.Too scared of another Marcos? Now, power doesn’t have to rest on just a single person, it can be vested upon a core body of leaders through one party.A One-Party SystemChoice is great. The fact that small insignificant members of society each have a hand at picking the next president or representatives in Congress sounds really cool. But we need to bite the bullet and accept the fact that this is not for us. Ordinary Filipinos can have the freedom to choose among which flavor of ice cream to buy, but not on deciding on something as important as a president. Filipinos are not known to choose the best for themselves (just look at where they spend their savings on). We should leave these kinds of critical choices to experts.The reason behind China’s meteoric rise to becoming the second largest economic behemoth in the world is for this very reason. Decision making has been confined to a core like-minded leadership with virtually zero external opposition. If they wanted to set up a trans-China bullet train or a space program which had a roadmap lasting 50 years into the future, the single party could give the stability and assurance to see it through irrespective of the specific personality at the helm.That’s in stark contrast to how Filipinos are handling mega-projects: one president of a given ruling party starts a mega-project only to be mothballed midway by the succeeding president whose party has a different priority or interest. No wonder we see low-quality half-finished roads all around with not even proper sidewalks and drainage.What the Philippines Needs More is Vision, not DemocracyThe freedom enshrined in democracy is also closely associated with chaos. Just look at the traffic in Metro Manila, how jeepneys and buses criss-cross lanes and load/unload in the middle of busy intersections. Is this the type of society and system we want for our children to inherit? We are now gripped by narco-politics. If you remove the pork barrel system in Congress, guess what. They will only look for something else even more hideous to bankroll their reelection.In contrast, vision brings about focus and precision planning. The problem with the Philippines is the lack of a stable leadership core that can set up a vision and align all the country’s resources and parameters toward that goal (family size vis-a-vis income, human settlement, internet bandwidth, mineral exploration, urban planning, and what not). Duterte is at the height of empowerment to be able to set up this one-party system in the Philippines, given the enormous public support and political capital he now wields.For the first time in many decades, we have a man whom the vast majority can rely on to be incorrupt and competent. He is the closest thing to the embodiment of a genuine benevolent dictator like Lee Kuan Yew who transformed Singapore. We are confident this man is not in it for the money, and that he has the best interest of the country in mind. Under Duterte is the Philippine’s one-in-a-million golden opportunity to take this leap away from the perpetually corrupt system we have today.American-style democracy was given to Filipinos too early. Filipinos need to evolve further under the stewardship of a benevolent one-party governing body that has the mettle to see us through to become the next Singapore-like Zaxxun-class state. If the ruling body says “No squatters in Metro Manila! Everyone go back to your provinces!” – there will be no opposition, as the body knows it is for the best of our tourism-dependent country.Why Companies are Not Run like DemocraciesEver wondered why the most successful companies in the world like Apple, Google, and Toyota do not ask their employees (from janitors to design engineers) to pick their next leader (CEO)? Normally, something like a core party at the very top makes that choice, because they are in the best position to make such a critical decision of choosing that man/woman who carries the company’s culture/DNA and has the proven potential to bring their organization to the next level.The Philippines should be run like a corporation. Why are there no squatters in the premises of Ayala’s Malls? Because it’s easy for top management to simply order their security personnel to eject would be invaders – No questions asked. Top management knows that a slum-like image is bad for business, and will not care even if most of their employees think otherwise.Who among us will argue that gigantic companies like Facebook, Ford, and Samsung are not faring well? Ask their employees if they’re happy not living under a corporate democracy. Results speak for themselves – you don’t need to operate under a democracy to be happy and successful. Filipinos should grow up and shed off that mindset of always trying to emulate their past colonial master.The Parable of the Eagles and the Maya BirdsThree Philippine eagles lived among three hundred little Maya birds. The eagles said “Let one of us eagles lead the flock because we can soar up above the stratosphere even beyond the clouds and are able to see from a higher vantage point. We are in the best position to lead you all.” But the Maya birds said “Ah, we don’t think you best represent us; we need someone who knows and feels our needs.” Then there was a long debate over how to make the decision, until one bird said, “I heard there was this thing called democracy. Why don’t we put it up for a vote?”So elections were held through secret balloting, and every winged creature in the flock held their breath to hear the pronouncement…Well let’s just cut the story short there since we all know the outcome anyway.

"The 1987 Philippine Constitution is crystal clear: the President may, in cases of invasion or rebellion, declare Martial in parts of, or, the entire country.When elements call for the “overthrow” of the governmennt, that constitutes rebellion.Well, student activists at the University of the Philippines across the country have publicly called for such overthrow. They even have a giant memo to show for their intention (see photo).So today, Duterte signed a still unnumbered proclamation imposing Martial Law at all U.P. campuses nationwide.",0
"long surge of the potent greenhouse gas methane threatens to make the fight against global warming even harder, top researchers warned Monday.“Additional attention is urgently needed to quantify and reduce methane emissions,” they wrote in the Environmental Research Letters journal, summarizing the findings of a consortium of 81 scientists.After rising slowly from 2000 to 2006, the concentration of methane in the air climbed 10 times more quickly the following decade, according to that study, which was published in the peer-reviewed Earth System Science Data.The unexpected – and largely unexplained – increase was especially sharp in 2014 and 2015.“Keeping global warming below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is already a challenging target,” they said, referring to the goal set in the 196-nation Paris climate pact, which entered into force last month.“Such a target will become increasingly difficult if reductions in methane emissions are not also addressed strongly and rapidly.”With only 10C (1.80F) of warming above pre-industrial era levels so far, the world has seen an uptick in extreme weather, including droughts, superstorms, heat waves, and coastal flooding boosted by rising seas.On current trends, average global temperatures are on track to jump by more than 30C (5.40F) by 2100, even if national carbon-cutting pledges annexed to the Paris Agreement are honored.Without those pledges, the increase would be much higher.To date, efforts to keep the planet from overheating have focused mostly on the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels that accounts for at least 70 percent of warming.But even as CO2 output has started to plateau, methane (CH4) – responsible for about 20 percent of the increase in global temperatures – is soaring.Indeed, the pace of recent emissions aligns with the most pessimistic scenarios laid out by the UN’s top science authority, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.CH4 is 28 times more efficient at trapping the sun’s heat. As with carbon dioxide, Earth naturally absorbs and releases methane.But industrialization and a surging human population have upset a long-standing natural balance, leaving an excess of both heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.Even if scientists agree that total emissions of methane are rising sharply, they remain uncertain as to why.Today, some 60 percent of methane originates from human activity, the rest coming from wetlands and other natural sources.About a third of human-generated methane is a byproduct of the fossil fuel industry.Researchers point to a surge in coal-generated power in China, along with leakage from the natural gas fracking boom in the United States.“Both these regions are thought to play a role” in the sudden hike, said Marielle Saunois, lead author of the editorial as well as the review, and an assistant professor at the University of Versailles Saint Quentin.But coal-fired plants and leaks from gas production are not sufficient, and do not jibe with the dramatic increase in the last two years, she told AFP.A more likely culprit, the study concluded, is livestock production and agriculture (especially rice paddies), which together account for nearly two-thirds of manmade methane emissions.A third possibility is a slow-down in the natural chemical reaction in the atmosphere that breaks down CH4.A more frightening prospect – that climate change has started to unlock massive natural stores of the gas in sub-Arctic permafrost – has been set aside, said Saunois.“Right now, it is a very minor factor,” she said by phone. “But there’s still a high degree of uncertainty, and not necessarily a consensus among scientists.”When it comes to climate change, methane’s saving grace is that it is much more short-lived in the atmosphere that CO2.That means that actions taken to reduce emissions will show rapid results, the researchers said.“Trends in methane emissions should be taken seriously,” said Stefan Schwietzke, an expert at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration whose own estimates of CH4 output, recently published in Nature, are even higher.“But we should not forget that we also need to reduce CO2 emissions, no matter what.”",1

"but he earned the rank in service with Gen. Douglas MacArthur.)Notwithstanding the phraseology of Sec 16 of RA 7157 that the President can appoint political ambassadors not to exceed “majority of diplomatic and permanent missions,” they assumed in past administrations only between 5% to 20% of all available posts in keeping with the career nature of the Foreign Service.Even post People Power, Secretary of Foreign Affairs Raul Manglapus warned against “(looking) at the foreign service and ambassadorial positions like a Christmas tree from which to pluck luscious rewards for its political allies, contributors, and friends.”A visit by the President to DFA would be the best way to reassure his shock(ed) troops that under the novel Duterte administration, diplomacy is too serious an undertaking to be entrusted to an OJT. In extremis, it may determine war or peace; in the most quotidian circumstances, it is responsible for the widening and deepening of bilateral relations.PDu30 should hear the sentiments of the men and women who may feel orphaned and anxious about their profession. Some of their thoughts:Ambassadorial positions do not become vacant with the assumption of a new president.Political ambassadors are co-terminus with their appointing president, and their positions become vacant.Career ambassadors remain in their assigned stations.In the heady days post EDSA People Power Revolution, even political consul generals were appointed. This is now precluded by RA 7157, which reserves this position for career service. (The fiddler Emperor Nero appointed his horse Pro Consul.)There were of course notable exceptions of political ambassadors who made good. I served under ambassador Gregorio G. Abad, who entered from left stage and became my benchmark and role model for an ambassador. At least four political ambassadors went on to head the Home Office: Felino Neri became undersecretary of foreign affairs; Mauro Mendez, Roberto Romulo, and Albert del Rosario became Secretary of Foreign Affairs.The President, street smart, should exercise judiciously his appointments that they are a credit to him, and not a liability to the country.",1

"Dingdong Dantes, Herbert “Bistek” Bautista, “Isko Moreno,” Leila de Lima, Francis Tolentino and Leni Robredo.They are among the 19 names short-listed for the administration coalition’s senatorial slate for the 2016 elections, according to Caloocan Rep. Edgar Erice, a member of the ruling Liberal Party (LP).Only 12 seats in the 24-member Senate are at stake in May next year.Actor Dantes is the husband of actress Marian Rivera and a commissioner-at-large of the National Youth Commission. Bautista is mayor of Quezon City while Isko Moreno is Manila Vice Mayor Francisco Domagoso. De Lima is the justice secretary and Robredo is Camarines Sur representative and widow of the former Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo.The LP list includes reelectionists and former senators and members of the House of Representatives.Others being considered for the administration senatorial ticket, Erice said, are reelectionists Senate President Franklin Drilon and Senators Ralph Recto, Teofisto Guingona III and Sergio Osmeña III; and former senators Panfilo Lacson and Francis Pangilinan.Also on the list are Energy Secretary Jericho Petilla; Joel Villanueva, head of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority; Francis Tolentino, chair of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority; Philippine Health Insurance Corp. Director Risa Hontiveros; Representatives Roman Romulo of Pasig City (who is on his third and last term), Rufus Rodriguez of Cagayan de Oro (also on his last term), Lino Cayetano of Taguig and Mark Villar of Las Piñas.June announcementErice said the lineup of the LP coalition would be finalized after the announcement of its candidates for president and vice president in June and after negotiations with coalition partners—the Nationalist People’s Coalition, Nacionalista Party, Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino, National Unity Party and Akbayan Citizens Action Party.“We hope to announce our choice for our presidential candidate before the end of June. We hope to start formal talks with our allies from July to September. It will all start with our choice for president,” Erice said in a phone interview.Erice said that at present, the LP was considering only Interior Secretary Mar Roxas as its presidential candidate.Sen. Grace Poe was being considered for Roxas’ running mate although no formal talks had been made with the daughter of the late actor-director Fernando Poe Jr., he said.In an interview on dzIQ, Erice confirmed reports that Energy Secretary Petilla had already submitted his resignation to President Aquino.The LP lawmaker said Aquino had accepted Petilla’s resignation but no replacement had yet been found.Filing of candidacyErice said he expected Roxas and De Lima to announce their resignations in June. Candidates for senator must file their certificates of candidacy in October.Lacson is on the list because he has not yet decided on making a run for president in 2016, according to Erice.The LP included Cayetano, a brother of Senators Alan Peter and Pia Cayetano, and Villar, a son of Sen. Cynthia Villar and former Senate President Manny Villar, because it had to reserve seats for its coalition partners.Erice said that although Isko Moreno belonged to the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino party of Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada, the former movie actor had sent word to LP officials that he wanted to join the administration’s senatorial ticket.RELATED STORIESBinay: UNA in talks with LP’s Recto, Osmeña to join 2016 senatorial slateOnly true believers will be in Liberal Party slate, says Roxas",1
"It has been 50 years since a 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck Luzon, causing death and destruction in Manila, but Filipinos may not have fully learned their lessons, according to the chief of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs).While the Philippines has updated its building code to allow structures in the country to adapt to the destructive forces of nature, Filipinos may not have done enough to prepare for disasters like the temblor on Aug. 2, 1968.“The main issue is implementation and inspection of buildings and houses during construction,” Renato Solidum Jr., officer in charge of Phivolcs and undersecretary for risk reduction and climate change at the Department of Science and Technology, said on Tuesday.Phivolcs exhibit, symposiumOn Aug. 2, the country remembers how, 50 years ago, Filipinos were roused from their sleep by one of the strongest quakes to hit the country in recent memory.In an effort to instill disaster resilience among Filipinos, Philvolcs has set up an exhibit and is holding a symposium at the Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene in Quiapo, Manila.The 1968 temblor, which claimed the lives of more than 260 people, gave Filipinos one valuable lesson: That the best measure against strong quakes is to make houses, buildings and infrastructure resistant to convulsions of the earth.“That is, build these with appropriate design, standard materials and good workmanship,” Solidum said.The 1968 temblor was eventually called Casiguran earthquake, as its epicenter had been traced to that coastal town in then Quezon province, now part of Aurora.But the quake is also often referred to as the Ruby Tower disaster, after the apartment building in Binondo, Manila, that collapsed as the earth heaved, claiming the lives of 268 people and injuring 260 others.“Ruby Tower collapsed from an earthquake with an epicenter more than 200 kilometers away. It is a reminder for everyone that a strong ground shaking even if the source earthquake originated far away can cause significant damage to houses, buildings and infrastructure if these are poorly built,” Solidum said.Unesco studyA study conducted 17 days after the disaster by a four-member team commissioned by the Paris-based United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), looked at the extent of the earthquake’s damage to structures, mainly in Metro Manila.The study found structural flaws in the damaged buildings.Ruby Tower Apartments, located on Doroteo Jose Street, was a 3-year-old, six-story building that housed 19 shops on the ground floor, 19 offices on the second floor, and 76 residential flats on the second to the sixth stories.“Initial failure probably occurred in the first-story columns at the southern end. Inertia forces would have caused torsional swaying with the largest deformation at the southern end,” the report said.Many other buildings in Manila, among them structures that dated back to the American colonial era, were damaged in the temblor.Among the flaws found by Unesco experts: flexible reinforced concrete frames, unbalanced walls, rigid exterior columns, beams shortened by walls, low concrete strength, insufficient reinforcing of corner columns and inadequate column ties.RecommendationsThe team recommended the production of an “inspection and survey report to determine the areas that are most liable to severe earthquake damage.”It also pushed for revision of the then City Building Code requirements “to raise the minimum standard of earthquake resistance,” as the Philippines still did not have a national building code.“Advantage should be taken to recent developments in earthquake-resistant design to achieve this improvement at a minimum cost,” the report said.The experts also recommended the creation of a zoning map for the country, based on known seismicity of each area, as well as “microzoning maps” for urban areas.According to Solidum, the country has accomplished much in preparedness and resilience, having learned lessons from past natural disasters.“Filipinos are now equipped with modern engineering technologies, seismic hazard information to serve as guide for design, and the appropriate codes to address the problems,” Solidum said.Update building codeHe, however, said the current building code needed to be updated.“There is a proposed Philippine Building Act that can further improve our laws and regulations on buildings and other infrastructure, which, I believe, is being coordinated by the (Department of Public Works and Highways),” he said.Solidum also backed the conduct of honest-to-goodness stress tests for the quench-tempered (QT) and thermodynamically tested (TMT) steel bars widely used in the country today, even for high-rise construction.“What is important for us to understand is that earthquakes do not kill people [but the] collapse of houses and buildings does,” he said.",1
"Employers would be violating the Magna Carta of Women should they opt not to hire female workers once the 105-day expanded maternity leave is passed into law, women and labor groups warned.Joms Salvador, secretary general of Gabriela, said on Friday that the Employers Confederation of the Philippines’ (Ecop) statement that women workers would be preferred less by companies was not only “highly discriminatory” but also encouraged employers to violate Republic Act No. 9710.Longer maternity leave“It is a desperate attempt to discredit a potential law that would oblige employers, such as Ecop’s members, to recognize the importance of women’s social function in the reproduction of the human race, alongside the protection of their rights as part of productive labor, which the expanded maternity leave bill seeks to uphold,” Salvador said.Earlier, Ecop acting president Sergio Ortiz-Luis was reported to have said that women applicants would be put at a disadvantage should the expanded maternity leave be passed into law.He noted that this was because men would be preferred over women since they would not go on long leaves.Under the consolidated bill approved by Congress on Monday, the number of days women are allowed to go on maternity leave will be raised from the current 60 days to 105 days.According to the Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP), Ecop’s stand shows how “selfish and greedy” employers can be.Not at same time“Ecop knows very well that by the coefficient of time and opportunity, women workers would not get pregnant all at the same time. Therefore, they are not a burden to the company,” Alan Tanjusay, ALU-TUCP spokesperson, said.“This discriminatory statement just shows that Ecop is antiwomen and has no respect [for] human nature,” he added.Nagkaisa labor coalition spokesperson Rene Magtubo said the employer group’s position showed its “low regard to women for their productive role in producing good and services, and more importantly for their reproductive role in society.”For his part, Sentro secretary general Josua Mata pointed out that data showed that only less than 1 percent of women workers availed themselves of maternity leave each year. And of all women workers, the majority, or 86 percent, were minimum wage earners.“This means that they are within the P16,000 salary credit, which the Social Security System will pay,” Mata said.Under the Magna Carta of Women, private entities found to have discriminated against women would be liable to pay damages.",1

"Yesterday, Mayor Rodrigo Duterte was officially proclaimed as the duly elected 16th President of the Philippines after defeating administration candidate ex-DILG Secretary Manuel “Mar” Araneta Roxas II. This, despite the administration’s clear and obvious attempt to cheat Duterte. Vice presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos was not lucky enough to get through the cheating by the administration. Fortunately, Duterte’s support was too strong and his lead was too huge to overcome.What happened? It was simply the post-Marcos administration’s failures that led the Filipino people to elect another seemingly authoritarian leader. The failures were exacerbated by the current government of Benigno Aquino III. His lack of leadership after the Luneta Hostage Crisis, the Al-Barka Massacre in 2011, and last year’s Mamasapano Massacre highlighted the impotence of his administration. Then, DILG Secretary Mar Roxas, who Aquino ignored in the Mamasapano administration blew his last chance to bolt the administration in an honorable statesman fashion. Roxas chose to stay, and eventually, it cost him the election.If you look at it, the three candidates critical of the Aquino administration –Rodrigo Duterte, Jejomar Binay, and Miriam Defensor Santiago- combined for majority of the votes cast for president. In other words, Aquino has no one but himself to blame for the Duterte victory and perhaps what is actually a Marcos victory. Duterte, a candidate running against the political and economic establishment, overwhelmingly defeated Roxas who was running for the establishment while being backed by 55 provincial governors and over 800 town and city mayors. Not to mention, Duterte won in Quezon City, which is the home turf of Roxas’ family.Such results show the wide dissatisfaction with the establishment. As mentioned earlier, had they not failed, Duterte would not stand a chance of winning. The victory of Duterte represents a radical change in the political system in the Philippines due to huge public anger. Coincidentally, the rise of new radical leaders is not only happening in the Philippines.In the United States, we have two. First, there is Democratic Party presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Like Duterte, Sanders is an anti-establishment candidate. When he announced his presidential run last year, most analysts said that Sanders’ campaign was dead in the water. Hardly anyone could blame them, as Sanders trailed party favorite and establishment candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton by 60 points in the national polls. Then came the primary season. Sanders would pull a tie with Clinton in Iowa. Then, he scored a blowout victory in New Hampshire. To this day the Sanders campaign, although trailing, remains standing and is looking for an improbable comeback against Clinton.Another is Donald Trump of the Republican Party. The real estate magnate from New York is also running on an anti-establishment platform. Not to mention, his brash and politically incorrect tone is similar to Duterte’s. Trump is more fortunate than Sanders, however. Trump had recently clinched the Republican Party nomination and based on the trends of the latest national polls, is actually poised to defeat Hillary Clinton in November. The Donald ran over 16 other candidates for the Republican nomination which had a good mix of up and coming leaders like Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio and traditional neoconservatives like Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Lindsey Graham.If Bernie Sanders manages to get the Democratic nomination, then the United States is in for a radical change regardless of who wins between him and Trump. And it is not only in the US where this is happening. Notably, it is currently occurring in Europe amid the rise of radical Islam in the region. Austria a few days ago almost elected a far-right leader to their presidency. Norbert Hofer missed out by just 31,000 votes.Additionally, nationalist leaders are also in power in Poland and Hungary. Besides Hofer, there is France’s Marine Le Pen. In the United Kingdom, there is Boris Johnson. In Norway, you have Sylvi Listhaug, Kristian Thulesen Dahl in Denmark, and Geert Wilders of the Netherlands. These right-wing populist leaders along with Trump actually differ from Sanders in some respects because they ride on anti-Islamic sentiment. To their credit, however, tolerance has allowed massive Islamic immigration to Europe and assimilation has become difficult. Thus, many sectors of the Islamic population in Europe have called for the Islamization of the region.All these circumstances were products of the policies of the mainstream political establishment in Europe. Like in the Philippines, the political establishment in the West has shown its failure and that it only seeks to represent the elites. This is where Sanders, Duterte, Trump and Europe’s right-wing populists agree on. It does not necessarily mean that all these people have to win. What’s important is the trends. And the trend is that all over the world, the people are shouting. The world will never accept globalism and elite rule.",0
"Several members of the Civil Society Organizations Philippines (CSO PH) urged the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on Friday to focus more on people mobility than on vehicles in crafting a transport policy.The CSO PH made the call in response to the passing of revisions in the National Transport Policy (NTP), which was approved on June 27, 2018.Members of Move Metro Manila, Alyansa ng May Kapansanang Pinoy Inc. (AKAP-Pinoy), Komyut PH, Alt Mobility, Environmental Laws Society of Ateneo (ELSA), and Affiliated Network for Social Accountability in East Asia and the Pacific (ANSA) demanded that all transportation systems hear and cater not only to the needs of operators and drivers, but also commuters.“We want the government to hear our pledge; to veer away from making more cars, they should focus more on people mobility, not car mobility, Komyut PH representative Rebecca Padilla said.AKAP-Pinoy Board Member Maureen Ava Mata said that the NTP must introduce innovative efforts for the PWD (Persons with disabilities) commuter sector.“We are not after special mobiles for members of the PWD; we are after innovation and for public transportation systems to include us in their priority list,” Mata told The Manila Times.The NTP is system adopted by NEDA that aims to unify all transport-related projects in the Philippines. The policy prioritizes accessible social services that would aid the problem of road congestion in the country.This policy seeks to provide a national transport system that is “safe, secure, reliable, efficient, integrated, intermodal, affordable, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and people-oriented.”",1
"The Sandiganbayan Seventh Division yesterday acquitted South Cotabato Rep. Pedro Acharon Jr. of a graft charge in connection with the unauthorized travel of city councilors for the Tambayoyong Festival in Los Angeles, California in 2006.Acharon was accused together with city councilors Jose Orlando Acharon and Minda Atendido, for conspiring with the issuance of the travel order for their trip to Los Angeles from June 9 to 16, 2006 even though their request for travel was in violation of a memorandum from the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).Acharon was the mayor of General Santos City when the Tambayoyong Festival took place. He was invited by the Sining Kambayoka Cultural Arts Foundation to attend the ethnic event, Pagana Dinner Show and Tambayayong Festival 2006, together with some local participants.He made a request to the DILG for the issuance of a travel authority, but it was denied. Acharon then took it upon himself to grant the travel authority of the two councilors.The prosecution charged Acharon and the two councilors with a violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019, also known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act because of this action.However, the court ruled that the foreign travel of a public official is never at one’s own bidding.It’s true that Acharon failed to secure the approval of former DILG Secretary Ronaldo Puno for the travel of his co-accused, so their travel could be held liable for graft.But the Sandiganbayan said that prosecution failed to prove that his action caused undue injury to any party, including the government.“A meticulous reading of [the travel order] issued by Mayor Acharon would nonetheless reveal that the intent of the foreign travel granted…is certainly not for a personal or private trip, but for an official delegation as it was intended for their participation in the Pagana Dinner and Tambayayong Festival 2006,” the court ruled.The court believes that “undue injury” should be interpreted as “actual damage,” and that “actual damage” must not only be capable of proof, but actually proved with a reasonable degree of certainty.Unfortunately for prosecution, it failed to present proof of actual injury as a result of Acharon and his co-accused’s actions.“Necessarily, the failure or inability of the prosecution to substantiate any of the elements of the offense charged under Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 is fatal to the cause of the people; hence, it renders inevitable the acquittal of the accused,” the resolution reads.",1

"There’s a common trait shared by some of the critics of US president Donald Trump and Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte that drives even the most rational supporters of both presidents into near-fanatic levels in defending their chosen candidate.The supposed supporters of “modern liberal thinking”, the antithesis of the “backward and barbaric” maxims supposedly espoused by the likes of these two recently-elected presidents, have tirelessly beat down and consistently displayed their disgust on everything they and their supporters have done as early as the campaign period, all the way to being sworn into office.For sexist remarks, gutter-mouthed orations, to racist and homophobic slurs, these polarizing characters have singlehandedly demolished political correctness without even trying. And that, as far as the champions of good behavior and crusaders of morality and everything good, is downright unforgivable.To the arbiters of so-called progressive thinking, support for the two controversial presidents and everything they stand for is the equivalent of an intellectual and moral lobotomy: There’s just no way an intelligent, morally upright person would support anything so ‘dumb’, crass, and given to outbursts unbecoming of a ‘statesman’.Therefore—whether it’s implied or stated bluntly—if you support these two in any way, you must be a racist, homophobic, bloodthirsty war-monger who does not know what he’s doing and who can’t see the possible ramifications of his ‘reactionary‘ vote.That about right?In the Philippines there’s a significant number of people comprising a small, but perpetually annoying group that think in terms of how things should be rather than adapt and work with what’s available because of how things are. Lovingly called The Yellows—named after the banner color of the Aquino Clan after the 1986 EDSA Revolution—they also branded themselves and their cause ‘disente’ (decent) as early as the campaign period as a counterpoint for Mar Roxas against the popular, but foul-mouthed Duterte.The Yellows, along with a small group of other dissenters who do not necessarily view the Aquinos as patron saints, have taken to the streets to voice their disapproval of controversial initiatives of the administration like the war on drugs and the Marcos burial. Some even matched the president’s penchant for hyperbole by declaring the Philippines is in the early stages of the apocalypse.What these people who insist on lofty principles (like the overused and abused term justice) seem to have forgotten is that the very entities they keep on demanding their government to provide have been already missing in the Philippines for a long time. And that these concepts seem to work only for a few privileged and moneyed families; and are all but alien to the average Pinoy trying to make ends meet on a daily basis.Where democratic institutions and concepts that are supposed to be in service of the people have been turned into mere abstractions with no real meaning or bearing in reality: ‘Law enforcement’, ‘justice’, ‘public services’, and even HUMAN RIGHTS have turned into vestigial extensions of politicians’ by-the-numbers-speeches that do not resonate in any way and leave any lasting impression to the general population.Which is not to say that all those ideals should not be upheld. There is a general perception among the critics of the present administration that it shuns these principles for shortcut methods to achieve maximum results in the smallest possible time frame. Lots of arguable points there from, moral, ethical and humanist perspectives. No question there.However, as what GRP has been asserting since its inception, government is simply the product of the culture that spawned it. And that Philippine culture is the main culprit.Because despite all the posturings to the contrary, the Philippines really is an inherently unjust and backward society beset with a troubling case of tribalism and acute clannish mentality that takes precedence over anything. In his article The Philippines: An inherently unjust society where criminals big and small get away GRP webmaster benign0 condensed that very sentiment about Philippine government in a very simple, but confronting question:In the Philippines, is there anyone in the government one can run to who could assure us that the best efforts will be taken and the latest facilities employed to get the job done?Given such a bleak scenario and a shortage of real action from institutions that are supposed to protect and render service for the average taxpayer, it is hardly surprising why the likes of Duterte’s brand of instant (allegedly) “vigilante” justice gained a strong foothold in a society that, as expected, thrives on doing things in a shortcut manner. Hence, the pwede na expression that, unfortunately, is still the norm in the nation. Just take a look at the candidates during the last presidential election and you can clearly see who stood out by packaging himself as a catalyst that would get the country out of its rut.As many political analysts in the Philippines have repeatedly said, a good number of voters have been fed up by the same ineffectual and flat-lining brand of management Metro Manila TRAPOS have been subjecting the entire nation for years. The small ‘Bisaya’ mayor was everything the old guard were not.It is perhaps the scathing video commentary of British news personality Jonathan Pie that best describes the same phenomenon when Trump won:“Most people didn’t vote for her, not because she’s a woman, they didn’t vote for her because she offered no palpable change whatsoever. Same old shit. Trump represents a change, a terrifying change, but a change nonetheless.”I totally get the outrage, because that’s exactly how I would probably react had the tables been turned and the person I supported was beaten by the one I would like the most to lose. And now, rumors of self-styled ‘patriot’ Loida Nicolas Lewis spearheading an Oust Duterte! movement had been circulating in both traditional and social media lately. The dissenters have apparently found their beacon of hope in her and Leni Robredo. All under the pretense of ‘saving’ the Philippines from a raving maniac.You don’t like Duterte, fine. You hate his mannerisms and policies, fine. You’d rather have pristine, sweet-talking, politically-correct, thieving dipshits endorsed by the equally corrupt CBCP; that’s fine, too. To each his pawn in the never-ending powerplay that is politics.But kindly drop the ‘moral’ and ‘decent’ bullcrap. We’re all Pinoys here, and you’re not fooling anyone.",0
" v. 20It began as a distant, foreboding hum, then grew into an ominous, earth-rattling din. Soon hundreds of tanks and thousands of enemy infantrymen swarmed into view of the badly outnumbered soldiers in Finland. Assessing the murderous wave, an anonymous Finn lent some perspective. Courageously, he wondered aloud about the enemy: “Where will we find room to bury them all?”Some 2,600 years before Finland showed such pluck in that World War II battle, an anxious Judean citizenry reacted quite differently to their own overwhelming situation. The Assyrian armies had trapped the people of Jerusalem inside its walls, where they faced the hopeless prospect of a starvation-inducing siege. Hezekiah nearly panicked. But then he prayed, “Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth” (ISA. 37:16).Through the prophet Isaiah, the Lord answered with strong words for Assyria’s King Sennacherib. “Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!” (V. 23). Then God comforted Jerusalem. “I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!” (V. 35). The Lord defeated Sennacherib and destroyed the Assyrian army (VV. 36-38).No matter what dangers loom on your horizon today, the God of Hezekiah and Isaiah still reigns. He longs to hear from each of us and show Himself powerful. —Tim GustafsonIn what ways has God shownHimself strong in the past?God is greater than our greatest problem.©2017 ODB Ministries, 3000, Kraft Ave., SE, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49555-0001, USA.

"Senate President Koko Pimentel said Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV should not be surprised why the Senate could not provide protective custody to self-confessed Davao Death Squad hitman Edgar Matobato.“Dapat nga na predict na nga nila na hindi ipapasailalim sa protective custody si Matobato. Siguro di nila alam na wala namang witness protection program ang Senado. Kung magbibigay ka ng protection sa witness, special case na yun, special treatment,” said Pimentel in an interview with Nimfa Ravelo of DZBB.Pimentel said Matobato should apply under the witness protection program of the Department of Justice, Commission on Human Rights, and Office of the Ombudsman.“Ano na yun, gagawa na on the spot witness protection program para sa isang tao o testigo na hindi naman mahalaga sa mata ng Senado. Kung mahalaga ang testimonya niya sa ibang kaso, lumapit siya doon sa tamang ahensiya ng gobyerno lalo na yung may executive functions,” said Pimentel, a political ally of the President.Pimentel said Matobato’s testimony on the 1,000 DDS killings allegedly ordered by President Rodrigo Duterte from 1998 to 2014 has no relevance to the Senate committee on justice and human rights’ probe on the 3,000 alleged summary killings in the last three months.“Dapat nga di siya (Trillanes) magulat, kasi fair tayo na tao. Ang gawin lang natin yung tama,” said Pimentel.Trillanes criticized Pimentel for having double standard on allowing witnesses to speak during Senate hearings. He said Pimentel was lenient, as chair of the Senate Blue Ribbon sub-committee, in allowing witnesses to speak on broad topics in the Binay corruption case but was not supportive of Matobato continuing his testimony in the Senate.

"Cabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco Jr. on Saturday said he would not be surprised if some groups dissatisfied with President Duterte would stage a “coup,” but he stressed that these people would not succeed.Evasco said generals included in Mr. Duterte’s drug matrix, businesses affected by the government’s drive against contractualization, and businessmen with interests in the United States would naturally be angry at the President.“Do you think they will be happy? All of those who will be dislocated by Mr. Duterte will look for an armed component to throw him out of power one of these days,” he said in a press conference.“That’s what you call a coup d’etat. But I tell you, if you are thinking and planning to do that, I will tell you you will fail,” he added.Movement for changeEvasco was in Cebu to attend the launching at Cebu Coliseum of Kilusang Pagbabago (KP), or movement for change, a nationwide initiative in response to the President’s call for participatory governance by consolidating all his forces into an organized mass movement.At least 8,000 Duterte supporters took the oath as KP members.The movement is a reflection of the people’s support for Mr. Duterte, he said. Its objective is to not only respond to calamity and disasters but also to protect the country against attempts at destabilization.Addressing criticism of Mr. Duterte’s war on illegal drugs, he said most Filipinos were actually pleased with its results and thus, would make a successful coup unlikely.“A coup will only be possible if there is mass anger toward the administration. But if people are contented because government services are reaching their doorsteps and government is responding to their basic needs, (a coup will fail),” Evasco said.People are aspiring for a drug-free country and that they, too, are in favor of killing drug lords and peddlers, he said.More than 16 million people voted for Mr. Duterte in the May presidential election. Describing the drug scourge as a pandemic, he vowed to stamp out illegal drugs within six months of his presidency.Antidrug campaignSince July 1, a day after he took office, more than 1,200 people had been killed in police-related drug operations.Another 2,140 deaths allegedly related to narcotics and blamed on vigilantes and criminal gangs are under investigation.“Some groups are complaining that many people aren’t batting an eyelash at all on who have been killed, but they don’t know they are just in favor of it,” Evasco said.He said he was an advocate of human rights and that it was correct at all times. But advocating human rights when the five pillars of justice have collapsed would be an unpopular position, he added.“If you do this, it will be perceived that you are on the criminal’s side,” Evasco said.

"If it were some minor official who said them, the remarks might have been interpreted as another attempt to downgrade the country on the global stage. But it was President Duterte himself who once said that “the Philippines is so dirty (and) the mayors are not doing anything.”He added: “There (are) trash and garbage around and yet we have to wait for the plastic to enter the drainage so every time there’s a downpour, excessive rain, water, there is clogging.”Mr. Duterte’s exasperation over the poor state of cleanliness in our cities is shared by many Filipinos, who’d surely view as a welcome development any effort to do something about it. We Filipinos are generally clean when it comes to our own homes (“Tapat mo, linis mo”), but public spaces are an altogether different matter.Sadly, no one gets to be 18 in the Philippines without having witnessed someone casually throwing trash from the car window. While we are proud of our country, surely we must also acknowledge that in terms of cleanliness, there’s much to be desired.This brings us to an important question: What does it take for a country to be clean? Two of our neighboring countries, Singapore and Japan, which are models of cleanliness can provide insightful—albeit contrasting—answers.National prioritySingapore’s cleanliness has long been the envy of many Filipinos, but it did not happen overnight. “At war’s end, the town was dirty, shabby and neglected. The roads were full of potholes, building were run-down,” wrote Gretchen Liu in her pictorial history of the island country.It took concerted and sustained efforts, beginning in the 1960s, to make Singapore the “Garden City” that it is today.

"Vice President Jejomar Binay has agreed to form an advisory council in the event that President Benigno Aquino III is forced to resign by a people power-like movement in the run-up to the 29th anniversary of the first People Power Revolution on Feb. 25.Former Tarlac Gov. Tingting Cojuangco on Friday said that her husband, former Tarlac Rep. Peping Cojuangco, who is Mr. Aquino’s uncle, was able to convince Binay of the idea. She said Binay gave the commitment in a meeting with her husband last week.“He [Binay) did agree to an advisory council, like a Sukarno-guided government,” Tingting told members of the Capampangan in Media Inc. in a forum at the Holiday Inn at the Clark Freeport on Friday.“Why would Binay not welcome it?” she said, noting that in the Constitution, a vice president succeeds a president who fails to perform his duties or leaves office.Binay denies itBut a spokesperson for Binay on Friday denied that that the vice president had agreed to the creation of any such body.“The vice president did not discuss the creation of a so-called advisory body with Mr. Peping Cojuangco or any political personality or group, nor does he intend to discuss this issue with any personality or group,” spokesperson Joey Salgado said in a text message on Friday.Salgado said he was told Binay had met with Peping Cojuangco in early February “on a totally unrelated matter”.He said that Binay, even if he is the constitutionally mandated successor, has reiterated that he was opposed to the resignation of the President.Ouster movesThe Aquino administration is reeling from a public backlash over the massacre of 44 Philippine National Police Special Action Force (SAF) commandos by Muslim secessionists in Mamasapano town, Maguindanao province, on Jan. 25.Various groups left unsatisfied with Mr. Aquino’s explanations about the tragic operation, including those demanding that he resign, are expected to converge at Edsa during the Edsa I People Power Revolution commemorative activities starting on Jan. 22.The National Transformation Council (NTC), a group that calls itself an ecumenical and interfaith collective, will be holding a Mass and rally at the Edsa Shrine at 2 p.m. on Feb. 22. The leftist Bagong Alyansang Makabayan said it would form a human chain for the Edsa 1 anniversary.The Cojuangco couple have admitted to being among those asking for Mr. Aquino to step down, but insist that they do not favor nor are party to coup plots.Tingting on Friday said that the rumored coup plot implicating them was “a spin of Malacañang.”She said a coup would not be needed. “Civilians can do it,” she said, referring to people power movements.“I think this is going to build up,” she said, referring to rallies during the Edsa anniversaries.No resignationMalacañang on Friday remained firm that the President will complete his term and step down on June 30, 201",1
"IN a bid to stop brain drain supposedly being experienced by the country, Sen. Grace Poe has filed a bill that aims to lure back Filipino experts and professionals who had left the Philippines in search of greener pastures to return and share their knowledge and help strengthen the country’s potential growth.Senate Bill 1324 or the Balik Scientist Act offers benefits, incentives and privileges to returning Filipino experts who are willing to share their expertise and knowledge to spur scientific and technological advancements in the country.“This bill envisions a future in which Filipino scientists contribute to nation-building and inclusive growth through the acceleration of research and development in the country,” Poe said on Thursday.The Philippines, in 2013, deployed 1.8 million workers mostly to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and other countries in the Middle East.But aside from skilled workers, professionals and science and technology personnel such as meteorologists, forecasters and air-traffic controllers also migrated to other countries because of higher pay and better benefits.Poe, citing data from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), noted that the presence of research and development personnel in the Philippines stands at 165 per million Filipinos, way below the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization recommendation of 380 per million persons.Her proposal seeks to institutionalize a “brain gain” program that would offer returning Filipino scientists short-term, medium-term or long-term programs to be administered by the DOST.For the short-term program with duration of at least 30 days, benefits include round-trip airfare, reimbursement of excess baggage costs, relocation and tax-exempt daily allowance, participation in grants-in-aid research and development projects and donation of instruments and materials related to the scientific activities.Medium-term engagement, which has duration of six to 12 months, shall also entitle experts to exemption from payment of travel tax including their immediate family and exemption from submission of Immigration clearance certificate and payment of multiple-entry fees.For the long-term award, which has a duration of 24 to 36 months, benefits include housing provision, reimbursement of expenses for the shipment of personal effects and professional instruments including one motor vehicle, exemption from securing an alien employment permit and budget to put up a laboratory, in addition to standard benefits extended to short- and medium-term programs.",1
"The camp of Sen. Grace Poe sees something sinister in the fresh moves to disqualify her from running for the presidency in the 2016 elections, saying it was an effort to subvert the people’s will.But Poe said on Friday that she was no longer surprised by the development and that her camp was ready with its response.“We believe their intention is to simply subvert the will of the people,” she said in a text message.Estrella Elamparo lodged Friday in the Commission on Elections law department a petition to cancel the certificate of candidacy of Poe for allegedly lying about her being a natural-born Filipino citizen and meeting the 10-year residency requirement for President.“This case is not about the right to be a Filipino. This case is not even about patriotism. Petitioner does not seek to deprive or trample upon respondent’s human right to her citizenship; neither is petitioner questioning her patriotism. This case is about certainty—certainty that the person who will occupy the highest post in the land complies with the fundamental law of the State. There is simply no room for doubt here and if there is even a scintilla or foreshadowing of it, she must be disqualified,” Elamparo said in her 71-page petition.Elamparo is a senior partner at Divina Law office. She is the former chief legal counsel of the Government Service Insurance System and also once served as prosecutor at the Department of Justice.Poe’s new spokesperson, Valenzuela Mayor Rex Gatchalian, described the case as “harassment.”Gatchalian said documents buttressing Poe’s argument that she is natural-born and qualified to hold elective office have already been submitted to the Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET).“These documents clearly prove that these suits are just baseless political antics,” he said.He added that Poe was confident the cases against her would be denied because the law is behind her.Elamparo’s allegations and arguments are similar to those raised by Rizalito David, a defeated senatorial candidate who filed a disqualification case against Poe with the SET.“Respondent, being a foundling, cannot be considered a natural-born Filipino citizen under the provisions of the Constitution. [Her] adoption did not have the effect of transmitting or conferring upon her the status of natural-born Filipino citizen,” Elamparo said.The lawyer said the presumption that Poe is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines is not sufficient to meet the citizenship requirement under the Constitution for those who want to be President.“Citizenship is determined by blood, not by place of birth, so it is she who asserts citizenship by place of birth who has the burden to prove her citizenship,” she said.RELATED STORIESPoe, Escudero bracing for more disqualification casesPoe wants disqualification case junked Asap",1
"ALL permits to carry firearms are suspended starting today with the start of the 37-day election period for the synchronized Barangay (Village) and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK or Youth Council) elections on May 14.Also, the seven-day filing of certificates of candidacy (CoC) for barangay and SK candidates commences also today and will end on April 20.James Jimenez, Commission on Elections (Comelec) spokesman, on Friday said the national gun ban would take effect at 12:01 a.m. of April 14.“The Comelec is duty-bound to strictly implement the firearms ban,” Jimenez added.Comelec checkpoints, he said, will also be established across the country to enforce the prohibition.Aside from the ban on the bearing, carrying and transporting of firearms and other deadly weapons, the availment or engagement of the services of security personnel or bodyguards is also strictly prohibited.Comelec Resolution 10197, promulgated on September 14, 2017, states, “During the election period, no person shall bear, carry or transport firearms or other deadly weapons in public places, including any building, street, park, private vehicle or public conveyance, even if licensed to carry the same, unless authorized in writing by the commission.”Exempted from the gun ban are regular members of the Philippine National Police, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and other law enforcement agencies of the government that are duly deputized in writing by the Comelec for election duty may be authorized to carry and possess firearms during the election period.The Comelec, however, said, “When in the possession of firearms, the deputized law enforcement officer must be in full uniform showing clearly and legibly his name, rank and serial number, which shall remain visible at all times, and in the actual performance of his election duty in the specific area designated by the commission.”According to Jimenez, the poll body may issue gun ban exemptions to other qualified individuals, “who by nature of their official duties, profession, business or occupation, such as but not limited to cashiers, disbursing officers, persons who are under the Witness Protection Program, etc., are considered as high-risk individuals.”All applications/requirements for gun ban exemptions shall be filed with the Committee on the Ban on Firearms and Security Personnel at the Comelec main office, 8th Floor, Palacio del Gobernador Building in Intramuros, Manila.Qualified to vote in the SK polls are duly registered Filipino citizens who are at least 15 but not more than 30 years of age on the day of the elections; a resident in the barangay for at least six months on Election Day; and not otherwise disqualified by law.Jimenez pointed out though that only qualified voters who are between 18 and 24 years old are allowed to run in the SK polls.He reminded candidates for the youth polls that that they need to declare under oath that they are not related within the second degree by affinity or consanguinity to any incumbent, elected national or local officials as provided for under Republic Act (RA) 10742 or the SK Reform Act of 2015.RA 10742 states that candidates should not be related within the second degree of consanguinity or affinity to any incumbent, elected national official or to any incumbent regional, provincial, city, municipal or barangay official in the locality where they are running.For the barangay elections, one should be at least 18 years of age on or before the day of the elections; and must be a resident of the Philippines for at least one year and living in the village where he/she intends to vote, for at least six months immediately preceding the barangay elections; and should not otherwise be disqualified by law.",1
"Metro Manila has earned the dubious distinction of having the worst traffic in the world based on the first “Global Driver Satisfaction Index” (GDSI) developed by traffic and navigation application Waze.The GDSI results, released on Sept. 29, were derived from Waze’s evaluation of the driving experiences of its 50 million users in 32 countries and 167 metro areas.GDSI is based on six factors: traffic level by frequency and severity of traffic jams; road quality and infrastructure; driver safety based on accidents, road hazards and weather; driver services like access to gas stations and easy parking; socioeconomic, including access to cars and impact of gas prices; and “Wazeyness,” or the level of helpfulness and happiness within the Waze community.Each country and metro area have been assigned a score from 1 to 10, with 1 being “miserable” and 10 being “satisfying.”“On a city level, Manila reported the worst traffic on Earth, with Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Jakarta not far behind,” Waze said. Manila scored 0.4 in the traffic index.Longest commute timeThe study also showed that the average commute in Manila lasted up to 45.5 minutes, the longest compared with 18 other cities in the world, such as London, Jakarta and New York City.Reacting to the Waze index, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said a modern and effective mass transit system could help solve the traffic problem in metropolis.“Other metro cities in the world have efficient mass transit systems, like the London Tube and the New York Subway System. Subways will solve our problems,” said MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino, who has declared his intention to run for senator in the 2016 elections.Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma said short- and long-term measures were being put in place by the government to improve the traffic situation in the metropolis.“What is important is our determination to improve the situation and pinpoint the problem and identify the solution,” Coloma said.Economic lossesEconomic losses due to the congestion in Metro Manila was estimated at P2.4 billion a day and could rise to P6 billion a day by 2030 if the government fails to intervene, according to a study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica).The losses do not include the impact of pollution from motor vehicles on the health of residents of the metropolis.Tolentino earlier said that a subway system, which he claimed would be part of the “leapfrogging of the mass transit system,” would greatly help in easing traffic congestion in the metropolis.SubwayHe said Jica had found that a subway in Metro Manila was “economically viable.”The establishment of a mass subway system is part of the P2.3-trillion transportation infrastructure plan (dream plan) for the metro. It was presented to the Cabinet by Jica in February.The subway line, which according to Jica will range from 40 to 70 kilometers and will connect Bulacan to Cavite, is expected to be done in phases to further enhance its economic benefits.Worst countryOn the national level, the Philippines is also the worst country in terms of traffic and socioeconomic indices, and one of the worst in the Wazeyness index.The bad traffic numbers are somehow offset by the ranking of the country in the GDSI’s safety and driver services indices in which the Philippines ranked among the world’s best.The Netherlands, despite being one of the most densely populated countries in the world, is said to be the best place to be a driver and has the least amount of traffic among all the other countries included in the study.Flooded streetsFor Ivy Malicay, a 33-year-old BPO specialist, the Waze mobile application is a reliable way to get from one destination to another, especially if you are not familiar with the routes.Aside from giving her the fastest travel option, Waze also provides her other possible routes which she can choose from, she said.Flood-watch appMalicay, however, said that the problem with the application was that it sometimes led her to flooded streets. She suggested that a flood watch-application be incorporated in the application.Sheremie Samson said she used Waze to guide her when riding taxis and prevent her from being fooled by devious drivers. Waze gives passengers an idea if taxi drivers are bringing them to the right and most efficient route, she added.Real-time users’ dataFor Chad Osorio, a law student who has been using Waze usually for out-of-town trips, the Waze application’s real-time data submitted by users allowed drivers to avoid the “hassle” traffic. “The problem, however, is when your net connection sucks, and if you’ve become too reliant on it, it becomes hard to navigate already,” he said.Also, there are instances when Waze provides inaccurate road directions that lead to longer route.–With reports from Jerry E.

"This ""open letter"" was found making the rounds on social media:* * *Dear Sirs:I just wanted to make some comments on the reporting of the CNN International crew here in Manila, regarding the relief efforts for the victims of super-typhoon Haiyan (which we locally call typhoon Yolanda).First, full disclosure: I am a retired Filipino executive and computer person. I was born in the Philippines and spent all my life here (save for some very short overseas stints connected with my career). I have worked with a large local Philippine utility, started up several entrepreneurial offshore software service companies (when outsourcing was not yet in vogue), and also served as the Philippine country head for a multi-billion dollar Japanese computer company. This diverse work background allows me to always see both the local and global point of view, and to see things from the very different standpoints of a third-world citizen, and a person familiar with first-world mindsets and lifestyles.I appreciate CNN's reporting, as it brings this sad news to all corners of the world, and in turn, that helps bring in much needed charity and aid. The tenor and tone of CNN's reporting has not been very palatable for a local person like me (the focus seems to be on the country's incompetence). But I shrug that aside, as there is probably some truth to that angle. And in reality, what counts now is that help arrives for the people who need them most; recriminations and blame can come later. Last night, I listened to a CNN reporter wondering about the absence of night flights in Tacloban, in the context of the government not doing enough to bring in relief goods. It was like listening to newbie executives from Tokyo, London or the USA with no real international experience, yet assuming that their country's rules and circumstances applied equally to the rest of the world. That was the proverbial last straw: I knew I had to react and call your attention to a few things (with some risk, since these topics are not my area of competence):1. The airport in Tacloban is a small provincial airport: when you get two commercial Airbus flights arriving simultaneously, you are already close to straining that airport's capacity. Even under normal operations, the last flights arrive in Tacloban at around 6pm, partly because of daylight limitations. Considering that the typhoon wiped out the airport and the air traffic gear, and killed most of the airport staff, you basically have nothing but an unlit runway which can handle only smaller turbo-prop planes. You can only do so much with that. I would assume that our Air Force pilots are already taking risks by doing landings at dusk. Take note that in the absence of any working infrastructure, the cargo will have to be off-loaded from the plane manually, while it sits in the tarmac. If you do the math, I wonder how aircraft turn-around's can be done in a day? How many tons of supplies could theoretically be handled in one day?2. The Philippine air force has only three C130 cargo planes (I am not sure if there is a fourth one). This is supposedly the best locally-available plane that is suited for this mission: large enough to carry major cargo load, but not too large to exceed the runway limitations. We do not have any large helicopters that can effectively move substantial cargo. I am happy to read in the newspapers that the USA is lending another eight C130 planes. I am not the expert, but I would suspect that even with more planes, the bottleneck would be in capacity of the airport to allow more planes to land and be offloaded, as discussed above.3. A major portion of the road from the Airport to Tacloban City is a narrow cement road of one lane in each direction. With debris, fallen trees, toppled electric poles, and even corpses littering the road, it took time to clear the airport itself, so that they could airlift heavy equipment needed to clear the roads. Then it took even more time to make the roads passable. Listening to our Interior Secretary on CNN, he disclosed that the Army was able to bring in 20 military trucks to Leyte. Half of them were allocated to transport relief goods to the different villages in the city, and the rest were assigned for clearing, rescue and other tasks. With very little local cargo trucks surviving the typhoon, I guess this would be another bottleneck. Again, I assume that if I do the math, there is only so much volume that can be moved daily from the airport to the city.4. The Philippines is an archipelago. Tacloban City is in Leyte island, which has no road link with the other major cities/islands. The only external land link (the San Juanico bridge) is with the neighboring island of Samar, which was equally hard hit by the typhoon, and which is just like Leyte (in terms of limited transportation infrastructure). The logistics of getting relief, supplies and equipment to Tacloban is daunting. Not too long ago, my company put up a large chunk of the communication backbone infrastructure in Leyte province. It was already a challenge to get equipment onto the ground then. This has always been the challenge of our geography and topography. What more now, when the transportation/communication systems are effectively wiped out in Tacloban?5. There is an alternate land/sea route from Manila to Leyte: down 600 kilometers through the Pan-Philippine highway to the small southern province of Sorsogon, taking a ferry to the island of Samar, and then 200+ kilometers of bad roads to Tacloban City. I was told that some private (non-government) donations are being transported by large trucks through this route. So many trucks are now idle in Matnog town down in Sorsogon, waiting for the lone ferry which can carry them across the very rough San Bernardino Straits to the town of Allen in Samar island. The sheer volume probably is over-whelming. Again I do not have the exact numbers, but my educated guess is that the low-volume Matnog ferry needs to transport in a few days what they would normally do over one or two months.6. The government administrative organization in Tacloban is gone. Most local government employees are victims themselves. This adds to the problems of organizing relief efforts locally. Even if augmented with external staff, the local knowledge and the local relationships are hard to replace. In some other smaller towns (where the death toll and/or damage has not been as bad), local governments are still somehow functioning and coping. They are able to bury their dead, set up temporary makeshift shelters, organize and police themselves. Short term, they need food, water and medical supplies to arrive; medium term, they need assistance in clean-up, reconstruction and rebuilding. But Tacloban is in a really bad condition. What can you expect from a city that has lost practically everything?I am told of the comparison with the Fukushima earthquake/tsunami, where relief supplies arrived promptly, efficiently, and in volume. I think there is one major backgrounder that CNN staff fail to mention: that Tacloban is not Fukushima, that it is not Atlanta. And the Philippines is not Japan, and certainly not the USA. Even before the typhoon, this region was one of the less developed in the country, with limited infrastructure. There was only a small airport, limited trucking capacity, a limited road system, and a small seaport servicing limited inter-island shipping. And with the damage from the typhoon, that limited infrastructure has been severely downgraded. It is easy to blame the typhoon. But the truth is: Tacloban is a small city in a third-world country. If you had to bring in that volume of cargo in that short window of time in pre-typhoon Tacloban, it would already have been a challenge. It is easy for a first-world person to take everything for granted. The reality (or sometimes, the advantage?) of growing up in a third-world country is that you do not assume anything, you take nothing for granted, you are grateful for what little you have (and you do not cry over what you do not have).I understand and sympathize with the desperate needs of the victims. Every little bit counts. The smallest food or water package can make the difference between life and death. I think every Filipino knows that. And that is why I am very happy with the national display of compassion and civic duty. Everyone, even the poorest, even the prison inmates, is donating food and money. People are volunteering their time. All the local corporations are helping. In the Philippines, Christmas is the most important holiday, and the annual company Christmas Party is probably the most important company event for most employees. Yet in very many companies in Manila, employees have decided to forego their Christmas party, and instead divert the party budget to relief/aid.From what I see on TV, the situation on the ground is not pretty. I do accept that efficiency needs to be improved, that service levels have to go up. I do acknowledge that our country's resources are limited, that our internal delivery capabilities may not be world-class. I do understand that there may be ineffective policies/processes and even wrong decisions made by government. But what I cannot understand is the negative tenor of CNN reporting. I suspect that CNN reporters are viewing this through the eyes of a first-world citizen, with an assumed framework of infrastructure and an expectation of certain service levels. I suspect these are expectations that we would have never met, even in the pre-typhoon days.Or perhaps it is a question of attitude: a half-empty glass rather than a half-full glass. At my age, I have experienced and lived through earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and at least twenty really bad typhoons (but admittedly, none as bad as Yolanda). From my experience, what we have now is not just a half-filled glass, I personally view it as probably at least 75% full (meaning, I think this is a big improvement over past efforts in past calamities). But please do not fault us for being a third-world country. Please do not explicitly or implicitly attribute everything to our incompetence, what might be due to other factors (such as those that result from limited resources or infrastructure, or those conditions that God or nature seems to have chosen for us). Our people are doing what they can, so let's give them a break. More so in these difficult times, when suffering is high, emotions are feverish, and tempers are frayed.It breaks my heart to see my countrymen suffering so much. I will do my share, whatever I can do to help. I will bear insults and harsh words, if this is the price for my people to receive the aid we need. I make no excuses for my country's shortcomings, but I just wish that some positive slant (the many small tales of heroism, the hard work of our soldiers, the volunteerism and compassion of the typical citizen, etc) would also be mentioned equally. I just needed to let you know how this particular Filipino reacts to your reporting, and I suspect there are many, many other folks who feel the same way that I do.For whatever the limitations, I still sincerely thank you for your coverage, and the benefits that it will bring my countrymen.Source:https://m.facebook.com/aireen.navarrokhauv/posts/10153544176195565",0
"U.S. President Barack Obama has finally broken his silence over the Philippine presidential race that’s turning out to be the most controversial ever in the political history of the former American colony.Speaking to reporters in Paris where he is attending a world summit on climate change, Obama said, ‘I have been informed that a division of the Commision on Elections has ruled to disqualify Senator Grace Poe from running for president on citizenship grounds. The popular senator and frontrunner in national polls is a foundling and is facing several disqialification complaints claiming she is not a natural-born citizen. Like in the U.S., only natural-born cirtizens can run for president.‘I feel you,’ Obama said about Poe, ‘because I have been in the same boat.’Througout his presidential career, Obama has been dodged with accusations that he was born outside of the U.S., despite having released copies of his Hawaii birth certificate.“I know the truth will eventually prevail, and that those who seek to discredit you will realize that they are making a huge mistake.’Upon hearing of Obama’a comments, Republican presidential candidate and frontrunner Donald Trump, a known birther, instructed his campaign staff to look into the cases against Poe so that he can make his own statement about the Philippine presidential race.‘As a candidate for president, I have to show my supporters and the American voters that I have the capacity and commitment to deal with foreign affairs, especially if it involves the birther issue,’ Trump said. ‘If Poe cannot show proof she was born in the Philippines, I will personally oppose her candidacy as well. If I am president of the United States, there can only be one American president.’ (Poe’s opponents are also claiming that by virtue of her dual citizenship, she is an American citizen.)",0
"“TO UNDERSTAND Joker is to understand the wind and the mist.”This was how former Sen. Manuel Villar Jr. described Sen. Joker Arroyo, who helped bring down two Philippine Presidents—the dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, and the accused plunderer Joseph Estrada in 2001.Arroyo died on Monday in the United States at the age of 88.A human rights lawyer, Arroyo rose to national consciousness as the first lawyer who challenged before the Supreme Court the constitutionality of Proclamation No. 1081 imposing martial law by Marcos.He later joined other lawyers in questioning before the high court the ratification of the Marcos-backed 1973 Constitution; Amendment No. 6, which vested lawmaking powers in Marcos alongside the Batasang Pambansa; and the power of military tribunals to try civilians.Arroyo also helped defend some opposition leaders during the Marcos regime such as the late Sen. Ninoy Aquino, the late Eugenio Lopez Jr., Communist Party of the Philippines founder Jose Ma. Sison, Sen. Sergio Osmeña III and former Senators Jovito Salonga, Eva Estrada Kalaw and Nene Pimentel.As a freedom fighter, Arroyo had his share of physical and mental tortures during martial law. He was incarcerated in a military stockade; he was also gassed, injured and hospitalized during protest rallies.In 2000, Arroyo led the 11-member prosecution panel of the House of Representatives during the impeachment trial of then President Estrada, who was later ousted in the subsequent Edsa II in January 2001.Arroyo said the impeachment courtroom drama that was beamed live to Filipinos nationwide from Dec. 7, 2000, to Jan. 16, 2001, showed just a fraction of the actual court work. “From the start, we made a statement that a legal battle is 80-90 percent preparation, and 10-20 percent court trial,” he said.‘Dear friend, mentor’Villar said he lost a “dear friend and mentor” and that having served the country well, Arroyo “deserved a big thank you from all of us.”“He was always the maverick. He would be leaving behind a nation that still suffers from the same problems that he liked to rant against with fierce dedication. And now he left us to face all these. Perhaps, the joke is now on us,” Villar said.Tributes flowed Wednesday for Arroyo, who suffered a heart attack while in San Francisco, where he had undergone last week a bypass and valve repair operation, according to a highly reliable source.Fellow senators expressed their sentiments as well as shared their memories of Arroyo, who served two terms in the Senate and retired in 2013. But the Senate could not honor him Wednesday, the last session day before it goes on a monthlong recess on Friday.Because the Arroyo family has not issued an official announcement on his death, Malacañang has withheld, out of respect, a statement on his passing, according to presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda.Senate President Franklin Drilon said the Senate could not observe Wednesday its traditions bestowed on senators who passed away, such as flying the Philippine flag at half-staff as well as just opening and closing the session.Drilon could only pay homage to Arroyo, whom he worked with in the Cabinet of the late President Corazon Aquino and in the Senate, saying he was a “brilliant lawyer” who took on strong advocacies.‘Great Dissenter’“Joker earned sobriquets in his storied life. The Great Dissenter. The Maverick. The Defender. He was even called The Scrooge for his economical use of office funds,” Sen. Ralph Recto said in a statement.“But there was one area he didn’t scrimp on. And that was offering his sharp legal mind, for free, to those who need it most but can afford it least,” Recto said.Recto said Arroyo had a good heart. “His form of exercise was to bend down and pull someone out of the gutter,” the senator said.When Arroyo was elected to the Senate, Arroyo already had a life’s worth of achievements and great victories won. “This country owes much of its freedom to him as do hundreds whose liberty he secured,” Recto said, referring to Arroyo’s work as a renowned human rights lawyer.“Joker Arroyo was a patriot first-class. Having walked in his shadows, I will always remember him as a boy in the fable who had the courage and the candor, who never failed and never tired to shout that the emperor was wearing no clothes,” he said.Opposite sides of fenceSenate Minority Leader Juan Ponce Enrile said Arroyo was “one of the best senators to come by in the Senate.”“I’m sad that a colleague like Joker has passed away and carries with him a part of the history of the land because while we were on opposite sides of the fence on some points, we agreed on some points but nonetheless we discussed issues in a very noble manner and according to our own perceptions,” Enrile said.Enrile recalled he was in government during the martial law years while Arroyo was very active in the opposition, and yet they remained good friends.The two men eventually ended up as members of the Cabinet of the late President Corazon Aquino.Eventual friendsIn a statement later, Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said he valued his time with Arroyo in the Senate.“Considering where we came from, we often found ourselves in agreement over political questions. I think because of this, I dare say we eventually became friends,” said Marcos, whose father declared martial law in 1972 that resulted in widespread human rights violations.Equally sad was Vice President Jejomar Binay who said Arroyo was a very good friend and a mentor. “I miss him,” Binay told reporters.Arroyo will leave a “lasting imprint on Philippine politics” because of his colorful personality, wit and deep analyses of issues, according to Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr.“His words never failed to capture the attention of media and of the general public,” he said. “In his many years in public service, Joker led a life of courage and humility that inspired many,” Belmonte said.“We thank Joker for his deep dedication to the Philippines and our people. He has left a legacy of staunchness and bravery, which we know shall be emulated by our young lawyers and public servants,” he added.“Although we were not really related, it was always a source of immense pride for us to share the name of this gallant human rights lawyer, overseer of the restoration of Philippine democracy, and exemplary legislator and public figure,” said former President and now Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. “In today’s world of smaller and meaner leaders, this giant of a man will be deeply missed.”Ako Bicol Rep. Rodel Batocabe described Arroyo as a “a great Bicolano.”“He had served as an inspiration to us, martial law babies, to be brave, to fight for our rights and uphold what was right and just during the Marcos regime,” Batocabe said.Infectious laughter“I did not agree with many of the positions he took, when he was Executive Secretary to Cory and when he was in Congress. But one thing you cannot take away from Joker: He did his part for people and country, and at a time when it was unfashionable and even extremely dangerous to do so,” said Theodore Te, the Supreme Court spokesperson who first met Arroyo when he joined the Free Legal Assistance Group (Flag) immediately after law school.He recalled Arroyo as “sharp” and “intimidating,” one who by instinct knew which legal arguments would fly or fizzle.“He was intimidating. He had a way of asking questions that probed, and probed deeply. And so there was no bluffing your way out,” wrote Te.He also remembered Arroyo’s hearty laughter: “And if you heard him laugh (hopefully, not at you), it was infectious. It was a belly laugh—a guffaw—one that emerged slowly and then later on continued through several sentences, often fading into chuckles, and many times, even after the joke.”“Sen. Joker Arroyo is best remembered as a beacon of light and hope for many political detainees and persecuted journalists during martial law. Together with other eloquent legal gladiators of his time, he inspired a generation to be voices in the wilderness amidst repression and to take up the lonely but fulfilling road of standing by those against whom the bad side of the law was used,” said Edre Olalia, secretary general of the National Union of People’s Lawyers.Case of YuyitungsAs a young lawyer, Arroyo defended the brothers Quintin and Rizal Yuyitung, publishers of the Chinese Commercial News, who were summarily deported to Taiwan in 1970 by the Marcos administration after they were accused of using their newspaper for alleged procommunist and anti-Filipino activities.In 1980, Arroyo cofounded the Movement of Attorneys for Brotherhood, Integrity and Nationalism Inc. (Mabini) and Flag.During the snap presidential election in 1986, Arroyo served as counsel of Corazon Aquino.After the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution, Arroyo became the executive secretary of the Aquino administration from 1986 to 1987, chair of state-owned Philippine National Bank and executive director for the Philippines of Asian Development Bank from 1986 to 1990.Arroyo served three consecutive terms as representative of the first district of Makati City from 1992 to 1998 as an independent.In 2012, Arroyo was one of the three senators (the other two were Senators Bongbong Marcos and Miriam Defensor-Santiago) who voted not guilty during the impeachment trial of Chief Justice Renato Corona.Arroyo was born in Naga City on Jan. 5, 1927. He studied pre-law at Ateneo de Manila University and earned his law degree at the University of the Philippines.

"A fire that swept through a shopping mall in Davao City was believed to have killed at least 37 employees of an American call center housed in the building, according to local officials.Firefighters found one burned body as the blaze was brought under control on Sunday, but 36 others remained missing and were feared dead, Mayor Sara Duterte, President Duterte’s daughter, told reporters.Mayor Duterte said firefighters had “assessed that no one would survive in that heat and with that thick, black smoke.”Six people were rescued and taken to the hospital.The President, who served more than two decades as Davao mayor, visited distraught relatives on Saturday night at a restaurant near the burning mall.Pictures released by Malacañang showed him visibly moved by the tragedy. In one, he was wiping tears and in a couple of others he was consoling weeping women.“It’s hard to imagine they could still be alive but let us pray,” Davao Archbishop Romulo Valles quoted Mr. Duterte as telling the relatives.The President said the missing had “zero chance of survival,” added Valles, who is also president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines.Wails of grief and disbelief followed the President’s statement.One woman wept in the arms of her husband, demanding those responsible for the fire be held accountable. “I will have nobody to cook breakfast for every morning anymore,” she cried.The couple’s 29-year-old daughter, Analiza Penarejo, was among those missing.Call centerA call center for Survey Sampling International (SSI) Davao, which occupied the fourth floor of New City Commercial Center Mall, is part of global data provider SSI of Shelton, Connecticut.The blaze started at a third floor furniture store around 9:30 a.m. on Saturday as mall employees and SSI staff began their weekend shift, said Senior Insp. Ma. Teresita Gaspan, spokesperson for the city police.Many who traveled far to meet the President expected to hear good news about their missing husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters who were mostly their families’ breadwinners.Elenita Liwayan, 46, and her live-in partner, Rommel, endured 12 hours on a “habal-habal” (motorcycle-for-hire) and a bus from the upland village of New Malitbog in Panabo City, Davao del Norte, to get word on her eldest daughter, Charlyn, 23.Terrible newsBut like the others, all they got was the terrible news.“She (Charlyn) was allergic to smoke. She would cough easily and have difficulty breathing if she’s exposed to smoke,” Elenita told the Inquirer.“[On] Dec. 20, she sent me some money and promised to spend New Year’s Day with us in Malitbog. Now, that may not happen anymore. I’m still hoping for a miracle to happen,” she added.James Basalan, 27, said it was supposed to be the last workday this year for his younger brother, Jonas.Text messagesBasalan said he got a text message from 25-year-old Jonas on Friday night, asking if he and other relatives were affected by the severe flooding that hit the city due to Tropical Storm “Vinta” (international name: Tembin). “I texted him back ‘We’re OK,’” he said.That was their last exchange of messages, said Basalan, who wanted to help put out the blaze to find his brother.From Lucena City in Quezon province, Judilyn Solis and her family were holding out hope her eldest sibling, Jessica, 30, had somehow survived.“We’re still looking forward to her return home for the New Year celebration,” a tearful Judilyn said as she and her parents headed to Manila to catch a plane to Davao where her sister worked as a manager for SSI.Firefighters have not completely put out the blaze early on Sunday, with pockets of flames erupting inside the building, which was built in 2003 and owned by the trading company Lim Tian Siu Inc.In respect for the grief of those who had lost loved ones, Mayor Duterte ordered the postponement of other activities scheduled for the city’s Pasko Fiesta festivities.",1
"Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Oscar Albayalde on Saturday assured policemen that they will be promoted or transfered under a policy that is fair to everyone in the police forceIn a news conference in Camp Crame in Quezon City, Albayalde said a policeman would be promoted based on seniority, merit and competence.He added that an oversight committee will review qualifications of policemen for promotion or transfer.Albayalde’s statements came after a text message circulated about certain police officials who got promoted despite lacking qualifications.“I do not know if they were already promoted or if they will be transfered to another post. This will be reviewed by the oversight committee if they are qualified for a promotion,” he said.In the text message, an anonymous texter complained that a certain police official was recommended for a promotion despite being an absentee for two years.“I hope they respect the law and policy of the PNP. They should be ashamed because they are not qualified,” the text in Filipino read.Albayalde called on his subordinates to be obedient to him at all times.“We all know that we cannot gain or command loyalty from everybody. I cannot please everybody and I will never go for that. The fastest ticket to failure is when you try to please everybody. We are in a uniformed organization so we expect obedience,” he said.Albayalde officially assumed his new position on April 19.",1
"The chair of the Senate public services committee on Friday expressed frustration at what she said was the lack of a clear direction on how to solve Metro Manila’s traffic crisis from President Duterte who, in 2017, described the nation’s capital as a dying city.Sen. Grace Poe reiterated her appeal for the passage of a bill granting emergency powers to Mr. Duterte to solve the crisis.In a presentation on Thursday, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) said the road gridlock was bleeding the Philippine economy tothe tune of P3.5 billion in lost opportunities daily, up from P2.4 billion in 2012.In December, Mr. Duterte distanced himself from the emergency powers bill, saying it was not he who asked for it.“You never heard it from me. It was the councilors and maybe (Transportation Secretary Arthur) Tugade because that was what he needs to do the right thing,” the President then said in a speech. “I never said, ‘give it to me.’”Enhance coordinationPoe defended the bill, which her committee had already passed, saying it would enhance coordination between national and local government units on measures needed to solve the traffic crisis.She said the government should take several steps to unclog Metro Manila’s main thoroughfares—develop a reliable and convenient mass transit system, build new roads and bridges, pursue innovative technological traffic management solutions and develop economic centers outside Metro Manila.“All this cannot be done without a well-thought-out plan,” Poe said.The bill, however, was being delayed by extended debates and mixed signals from Mr. Duterte, according to Poe.Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said there was no magic bullet to fix “carmageddon,” or the sheer chaos on major roads caused by the traffic crisis.Recto said what was needed was a “cocktail of solutions” that ranged from changes in driver behavior to “dispersing economic activity to the regions.”‘Builder in chief’But the crisis has already reached the point where measures to solve it has to be monitored daily by the country’s “builder in chief,” or the President.“Malacañang should lead,” said Recto. A hall in Malacañang, he said, could be converted into a “war room” where progress in Mr. Duterte’s “Build, Build, Build” program could be monitored in real time in relation to its effect on traffic.Another senator, Sherwin Gatchalian, chair of the Senate committee on economic affairs, said the only solutions were a mass transport system and a subway.He said aside from the P3.5 billion in daily economic losses brought by the crisis, road gridlock was also contributing to the “deterioration of the quality of life of our citizens.”Senate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto III said the solution was simple—rid city and inner streets of parked cars, tricycles and other obstructions. “This can be done if there’s political will,” he said.Dismantle Metro ManilaIn a speech in Clark, Pampanga, in December 2017, the President sounded like he was giving up on Metro Manila.“It is important that we disperse the industries because Manila, in about 25 years, will be a dead city,” Mr. Duterte said then. “It will start to decay because there is no way we can rehabilitate the place.”“You cannot rehabilitate the place, you have to dismantle it to do that,” he said.",1
"Even if Senate President Vicente Sotto III had been cold to the passage of the antidiscrimination bill, Bataan Rep. Geraldine Roman isn’t losing hope that he would be reasonable enough to allow the Senate to vote on the long-languishing measure, which seeks to provide equal rights to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.Roman said she believed that Sotto “has the heart to recognize the rights of members of the LGBT community.”Staunchly opposedThe new Senate President staunchly opposed the passage of a sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (Sogie) bill during his time as Senate majority leader.“I’m confident that the Senate President will enter into reason and that he will be open to further discussing the antidiscrimination bill on the floor, and base his judgments on the merits of an intelligent debate and discussion,” Roman said at the sidelines of the launch of Medical Center Manila’s gender diversity center on Friday.La Salle gatheringMore than 500 members of student councils, youth groups and the LGBT community gathered on Friday night at De La Salle University in Manila to denounce the Senate for delaying the bill’s passage.“We don’t know what the main causes of the delay are, but we are hoping that with the new Senate leadership, those delays will be ended,” said Lance dela Cruz, media relations officer of Sogie Equality Group.While the House of Representatives passed the bill last year, its counterpart bill in the Senate, authored by Sen. Risa Hontiveros, is still facing an uphill climb.",1
"Every Tom, Dick and Harry had already testified before Senator Grace Poe’s Senate committee investigating the proliferation of fake news on social media: Secretary Martin Andanar, Asec Mocha Uson, Thinking Pinoy, Jover Laurio, Maria Ressa, Ellen Tordesillas, and officials from Facebook and Google. Yet, after the third hearing today, the committee has failed to come up with a definition of ‘fake news.’Resource person after resource person either refused or was hesitant to define fake news, or evaded the question altogether.This has been a source of frustration for Poe, as she felt that all her efforts to shed light on this hot and controversial issue have not gone anywhere.So today, in a display of extreme disappointment and perhaps embarassment, Poe walked out of her own Senate hearing.Will she be Senator Leila De Lima’s successor as the Walkout Queen of the Senate?",0

"Is it time to halt the TRAIN?A joint Senate panel will assess on Wednesday the inflationary effects of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act and determine whether it’s a good idea to suspend the implementation of some of the increases in excise taxes felt most heavily by the poor.“We want to know the impact of TRAIN on our people. In my travels to different areas of the country, many of our countrymen are already complaining because of the rising prices,” Sen. Bam Aquino told reporters on Tuesday.Besides the spike in the price of rice “due to the mismanagement of the NFA (National Food Authority),” Aquino said prices of gasoline and other basic commodities had also skyrocketed.At the House of Representatives, Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano has formally sought a congressional inquiry into how the price increases caused by the TRAIN law have affected Filipinos.Alejano said the review would guide the House in determining if there was a need to suspend the law or to come up with measures that would cushion its impact on the poor.The TRAIN law exempted from the payment of income tax workers earning up to P250,000 starting Jan. 1, but raised the excise tax on a host of goods and services.Put on holdAquino said the Senate committees on economic affairs and on ways and means would also discuss the possibility of “suspending” the implementation of some TRAIN provisions, including the raising of excise taxes on fuel.He noted that under the TRAIN law, there would be automatic lifting of the excise tax increase on oil products once a certain level of the global prices of crude oil had been reached.Thus, he said, new legislation would be needed to suspend the tax law.Excise tax on fuelSen. Sherwin Gatchalian, chair of the economic affairs committee, said it was highly possible that the Senate—and Congress as a whole—would recommend the suspension of the implementation of TRAIN.“What is important here is we protect our poorest people, especially those living hand-to-mouth,” he told reporters.“The biggest is the excise tax on fuel, on petroleum products. So if there is suspension that will be No. 1 on the list,” Gatchalian said.In a statement, Sen. JV Ejercito called on the government’s economic managers to suspend the TRAIN law to “arrest the rising inflation rate.”Inflation accelerated to 4.5 percent year-on-year in April, the fastest in more than five years. The full-year target is 2 to 4 percent.“It might be wise to consider the suspension of the TRAIN law if the trend continues to breach the inflation threshold,” Ejercito said.He said the economic managers should seriously assess the impact of the TRAIN law given the upward trend of the numbers.“They should assess whether the increase in inflation is still manageable. Otherwise, implementation of TRAIN 1 should be suspended and restudied,” he added.Benefit canceledRepresentatives of the National Economic and Development Authority, Department of Finance, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Department of Trade and Industry, and Department of Social Welfare and Development have been invited to Wednesday’s Senate hearing.In House Resolution No. 1838, Alejano said higher prices—blamed on the increase in taxes on fuel and certain consumer goods—would wipe out the benefit of an increased take-home pay that middle class employees expected from a decrease in income taxes.“The continued increase in inflation would likely lead to decreasing amount of goods and services that an individual would be able to purchase, offsetting the higher take-home pay that the TRAIN law afforded the Filipinos,” the resolution read.The government has justified the increase in the excise tax on fuel by saying the 10-percent richest families account for 51 percent of total fuel consumption.But Alejano’s resolution said the government “failed to consider that most Filipinos still rely on mass transport … which will surely be affected by the increase in excise tax.”He said the government’s statements claiming that additional revenue from the TRAIN law would go to the “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure program was “only a ploy to get public support.”",1

"As thousands of National Guard troops deploy to the Mexico border, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions plans to bring his firm stance on immigration enforcement to New Mexico where a group of Southwest border sheriffs are meeting Wednesday.Sessions will speak in Las Cruces at the Texas Border Sheriff’s Coalition Annual Spring Meeting with the Southwestern Border Sheriff’s Coalition, which is made up of 31 sheriff’s departments from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.Their counties are located within 25 miles (40 kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico border.Immigrant rights activists promised to protest Sessions’ visit on Wednesday, as they rejected his past characterization of the border region during a 2017 visit to El Paso, Texas, as “ground zero” in the Trump administration’s fight against cartels, and human traffickers.“He treated our home like a war zone, referring to it as ‘ground zero,’” said Fernando Garcia, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights in El Paso. “He was wrong then, and he is wrong now.”El Paso is some 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Las Cruces.Sessions’ trip to Las Cruces, a city about an hour north of the border, comes as construction begins nearby on 20 miles (32 kilometers) of steel fencing that officials say is a part of President Donald Trump’s promised wall.U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials have described the new, heightened barrier as a structure that will be harder to get over, under and through than the old post and rail barriers that line the stretch of sprawling desert west of the Santa Teresa port of entry.Sessions has issued an order directing federal prosecutors to put more emphasis on charging people with illegal entry, citing a “crisis” on the border.A 37 percent increase in illegal border crossings in March brought more than 50,000 immigrants into the United States, which was triple the number of reported illegal border crossings in the same period last year. It was still far lower, however, than the surges during the last years of the Obama administration and prior decades.The attorney general’s “zero-tolerance” for border-crossing prosecutions calls for taking action against people who are caught illegally entering the United States for the first time. In the past, such offenses have been treated as misdemeanors.He also recently set quotas for immigration judges to reduce enormous court backlogs, saying they must complete 700 cases a year to earn a satisfactory grade. The quotas take effect Oct. 1.",1

Drug lords expect to be paid after a certain period and they do not accept returns. Drug lords kill street pushers who fail to meet their sales quota to strike fear on other street pushers. The fear motivates the surviving pushers.You sell, or you die“There may be fewer people who want to buy (shabu), or the dealers want the trade to be faster to avoid being caught and for some other reasons.

The problem, however, is that no one has, so far, provided anyone a clear an comprehensive explanation about how the illegal shabu (meth) industry works.Thus, in this article, ThinkingPinoy will explain the Shabu Business Process from supply, to manufacture, to distribution, to retail, and finally, to consumption, with the Philippine Shabu Market in mind.The shabu business is just like any other manufacturing business that follows this basic process:Almost everybody knows this. However, what many still don’t understand is HOW EXACTLY this process works in the context of Philippine shabu, and explaining this process is what I will do.Let’s go.There are many ways to cook shabu, with the basic method using several nondescript ingredients, ethyl phenyl acetate , whose legality in the Philippines is still unclear to me, and one key precursor chemical: ephedrine. Ephedrine is a controlled substance in the Philippines [ PDEA ]. One kilogram of ephedrine, after combining with other ingredients, can be converted into 750 grams of shabu [ Inq ].Large-scale shabu cooking operations are usually the domain of drug cartels. When I wrote “ Duterte’s Drug War, where is the logic in 400 Deaths? ”, I said there are at least 11 key players in the Philippine Shabu Industry:In 2014, it was discovered that the Hong Kong-based 14K and Sun Yee On triads (Chinese Cartel) supply raw materials for use in the Sinaloa cartel’s shabu laboratories in the Philippines [ SCMP ].Hong Kong is part of China, and China is the No. 1 source of drugs in the Philippines [ Inq ]. Chinese cartels find it easy to smuggle shabu precursors into the country because the Philippines’ archipelagic nature provides lots of points of entry, and law enforcement was lax.The government has identified three key persons who facilitate this process:Yes, Colangco won the award WHILE IN PRISON.As long as you have ephedrine, manufacturing shabu is very easy: it does not require advanced training and all you need are household items that you can legally purchase from a supermarket, with the only major challenge being the ingredients’ flammability: a poorly-constructed, do-it-yourself shabu lab can explode [ Inq ].Because cooking shabu is not very high-tech, setting up shabu labs is relatively easy. Hence, shabu labs have been found in many places in the Philippines, including:Let’s recap:Alright, the shabu is ready, what comes next?The shabu final product is ready, so how does it reach the streets? This is where the second step comes in: shabu’s movement from the shabu labs to the hands of retailers.Manufacturer-to-dealer logistics is pretty straightforward. What’s complicated however, are two things:Just like regular citizens, drug syndicates communicate through mobile phones and the internet. This is the same reason why the government was in shock when it raided the New Bilibid Prison a few years ago and discovered cellular signal boosters inside the jail compound [ GMA ]. It would have been easy for law enforcement agents to track the movements of these syndicates by tapping on their phone phone calls, but they are fraught with three key problems:, wiretapped conversations are inadmissible as evidence in court per local laws [ PCIJ ]. This is the same reason why the Duterte cannot use as evidence the wiretapped conversation between Senator de Lima and her alleged driver-bodyguard-lover-bagman Ronnie Dayan , that was provided to him by foreign intelligence agents [ GMA ]., SIM card registration is not required in the country [ Inq ], so drug dealers can simply toss an old SIM card, get a new one, and law enforcement agents who tap for leads will have to start all over., law enforcement agents themselves are involved in the drug trade [ TP: PNP Generals TP: 400 Deaths ]. LGU officials are also involved in it, making manufacturer-to-dealer logistics a lot, lot easier [ TP: Mayors ].Alright, so the shabu is now in the local wholesale drug dealer’s hands, so what happens next?Wholesale drug dealers then hand over shabu to smaller scale drug pushers (retailer, “tulak”), similar to the relationship between a large insurance company and a lowly insurance agent.But there’s a major difference.According to the US Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) [ BJS 1992 ]:The fight against drugs is one of Duterte’s core campaign platforms, and his well-publicized crackdown on shabu caused demand to go down.For example, in June 2016, demand for narcotics dropped in Naga City in anticipation of the Duterte’s 30 June 2016 inauguration [ ABS ].A similar incident was report in the Cordilleras a month later, where Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA Regional Director Juvenal Azurin said in Filipino:After a certain point, many shabu consumers or adiks (addicts) run out of personal funds to sustain their habit. This is when they resort to two things:At this point, you now have a working idea about how large-scale shabu business works, but there’s one more thing that we haven’t discussed yet: Expansion and Stabilization.Shabu is a business. And just like any other business, they seek to expand operations as soon as they have established their core operations (i.e. Steps 1 to 5).So how do drug syndicates do this?Sinaloa is the most powerful and influential drug syndicate in Mexico today.Established in the mid-1990s, the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel first gained control of the Mexican state of Sinaloa, then expanded to five other Mexican States. Afterwards, it established operations across the United States. After dominating North America, it set up operations in South America, West Africa, and Europe [ Chalk 2012 ].But where in Asia?What's left? Southeast Asia, where law enforcement is lax and the economies are booming.Drug smuggling in Southeast Asia has been on the rise in as early as 2012 [ Globe ].In 2013, authorities confirmed that the dreaded Mexican Sinaloa Drug Cartel has arrived in the Philippines [ ABS ]. Just last year, PDEA operatives arrested Horacio Hernandez in Makati City. Hernandez is third in command to the Sinaloa Drug Cartel [ Vice ].When a drug syndicate enters a geographic area, its operations may encounter resistance from other drug syndicates who are already operating in the same territory. Overlapping operations of rival drug syndicates bring rise to “turf wars”, where rival syndicates kill each other off to gain new territory or to protect their own.Let’s see how the the Sinaloa Cartel works [ DailyMail ].In 2015, Israel Hinosa revealed he killed members of rival drug cartels under orders from the top honchos of the Sinaloa Drug Cartel, for as little as $30 (Php 1,500) per assignment. He was addicted to heroin and crystal meth, and he would indulge in these drugs to numb post-assassination psychological trauma.Hinosa was a “sicario”, a desperate individual who became ruthless killers for the narcotrafficking industry and in his case, for the Sinaloa Cartel. Sicarios were an integral part of the mass murders ensuing from the Sinaloa Cartel’s declaration war on the Juarez Cartel in 2007, where more than 20,000 people in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico lost their lives in the next five years.Hence, we ask: Do we have sicarios in the Philippines?Yes, we do [ MB ].Let’s watch the video clip shown below:We all know this.If you want to know more, you can read the following articles I previously wrote:Duterte previously asserted that most of the shabu in the Philippines come from Chinese Cartels whose base is, obviously, in China [ SCMP ]. Because he has zero authority over the China, he has to cooperate with the Chinese government in this regard. As to how the Chinese government will deal with is, is a totally different story.This is the same reason why Duterte said, ““Hey, I have to invade a country to arrest the drug lords [ Inq ]”.Given these, what can Duterte do?Looking at Steps 1 to 5, we can see that while Step 1 might be out of the government’s hands, the remaining steps are done within the country, i.e. within the government’s jurisdiction.This is the same “drug apparatus” that Duterte has been referring to [ MB ].That is, even if the government exercises no power over the supply of raw materials, it still has power to destroy manufacturing plants, distribution facilities, retail networks and most importantly, the corrupt public officials who make all of them possible.However, the disruption of shabu’s business process means death. As I have explained in the previous sections:Legalization of shabu? Of course not. The oft-cited Portuguese drug decriminalization is about cocaine and heroin, which work VERY DIFFERENTLY from shabu.No, shabu decriminalization will not work either.Besides, if decriminalization was even feasible, is that the executive's problem? It's the legislature who should be doing that. It is DE LIMA who should be doing that.Duterte’s war on drugs has been encountering opposition from local and international media, with the latter blaming the alleged drug-related deaths – even all of the vigilante killings – solely on the administration. The problem, however, is that mainstream media’s reasoning is too simplistic, as it totally ignore the gruesome reality that I have just explained.The recently concluded Senate Hearing on Extrajudicial Killings is a testament to that. We saw two days’ worth of grandstanding on the part of Senator Leila de Lima and CHR Chairman Chito Gascon, but not a single testimony or piece of evidence showing that the State itself sanctioned extrajudicial killings or even tolerated it [ TP: Gascon; TP: Leni Robredo ].Mainstream media wants the killings to stop, but they provide no viable alternatives.I guess mainstream media's oligarch owners simply cannot bear the idea that a common man with a heart for the people is now the most powerful Filipino... or are our mainstream journalists on the payroll of drug lords themselves?

"The camp of Vice President Jejomar Binay demanded Tuesday that the three senators tormenting him submit an audit of their respective projects financed by the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) and other congressional insertions in the spirit of transparency.The challenge was issued by Binay’s political spokesman, Rico Quicho, to Senators Aquilino Pimentel III, Antonio Trillanes IV and Alan Peter Cayetano.Quicho said he issued the challenge since Pimentel “has been bandying about that the ongoing Senate blue ribbon subcommittee hearings on Binay are being conducted under the principle public office is a public trust.”“Their infrastructure projects should also be audited using the Langdon and Seah Construction Cost Handbook, which they have invoked in the hearings and subsequent report,” Quicho said, referring to book used by the subcommittee in looking at the construction costs of the allegedly overpriced Makati City Hall Building II.Quicho also slammed Pimentel for just calling for an audit of the key shelter agencies that Binay handled when he was still the head of the House and Urban Development Coordinating Council, saying it would have been “reasonable” if the senator also sought an audit of all agencies handled by resigned officials.Regularly auditedReplying to Quicho’s challenge, Pimentel said, “All PDAF projects are regularly audited with or without our consent.”Trillanes said that for the nth time, he had said that his PDAF/DAP projects had been audited by the Commission on Audit.“They are all posted on our website and anybody can access it,” Trillanes said in a text message.He said that if Binay’s camp had any information that his office had committed any irregularity, “then they could simply expose it to the media.”“In the meantime, they should answer the numerous allegations of corruption against them,” Trillanes said.–Christine O.

Ang ""expert"" na nagsabing Pinoy daw ang nursery rhyme/song na Tatlong Bibe kagaya ng Bahay Kubo. P*t*ng*n*Tatlong Bibe is of Filipino origin?Online celebrity Dyosa Pockoh featured Tatlong Bibe in as early as 2014. Tatlong bibe entered mainstream pop culture after being featured in the TV show “Be my Lady”. According to “Literary Studies Expert” Miguel Lim Quizon, Tatlong Bibe is a Filipino children’s rhyme passed from older generations. Tatlong Bibe is in the same league as “Bahay Kubo”.The Story behind Tatlong BibeTATLONG BIBEMay tatlong Bibe akong nakitaMataba, mapayat mga bibeNgunit ang may pakpak, sa likod ay iisaSiya ang lider na nagsabi ng kwak, kwakTHREE DUCKSI saw three ducks,A fat duck, a thin duck,But the winged-back oneHe's the leader who says,Quack, quack, quack.The Origin of Six Little DucksHere's a 1945 recording of Bell Bottom TrousersThe melody sounds different from Tatlong Bibe because the latter is a vastly simplified, easier-to-sing version.Tatlong Bibe: Pinoy or Western?The song “Tatlong Bibe” has an English (US) version entitled Three Ducks. Three Ducks is a part of the longer English (US/UK) song “Six Little Ducks”. Six Little Ducks borrowed its melody from the 1944 US song “Bell Bottom Trousers”. Bell Bottom Trousers’ melody is a commercially simplified version of the melody for “Rosemary Lane”. Rosemary Lane is a UK folk song that dates as far back as the 1800s.Where did Tatlong Bibe come from?I stumbled upon Bambit Gaerlan’s Tagalog Facebook post that reads:Alright, the first two items are obvious incidents of sheer idiocy. The third, on the other hand, piqued my interest. Why? Because my Facebook friends are going gaga over “Tatlong Bibe (Three Ducklings)”, and I never really cared about it until my wall got inundated with homemade “Tatlong Bibe” dance videos.Ok, this issue has nothing to do with Philippine Politics, but please indulge me because nangangati ang utak ko.But first, let me give you a bit of context.According to a video clip by ABS-CBN entertainment journalist MJ Felipe [ ABS-CBN ]:Okay, the first two points are hardly debatable because they are fairly recent information and if there’s something wrong about it, somebody would’ve already pointed that out. The third, point, however, is another story. Quizon said Tatlong Bibe is a Filipino children’s rhyme. Because we don’t expect a “Literary Studies Expert” to simply state the obvious and “Bahay Kubo” is a distinctly Filipino children’s rhyme [ de Leon 2015 ], it is fair to conclude that Quizon meant Tatlong Bibe is also distinctly Filipino.Well, ABS-CBN said Quizon is a “Literary Studies Expert”, whatever that means, so we must believe whatever he says, right?No. It’s time for a bit of critical thought.Quizon is a graduate student in Ateneo de Manila’s MA Literary and Cultural Studies [ NUS ]. He is also an instructor in Don Bosco Technical College-Mandaluyong’s General Education Department. While the source does not say when he will or when he did graduate, a document shows that he presented a research paper on 24 June 2015 as an ADMU graduate student of [ NUS ]. Assuming that he received an MA degree in November 2015, six months out of graduate school doesn’t make someone an expert, yet. Besides, Tatlong Bibe’s history is such a mundane topic that a grad student is more likely to not take it seriously.So yeah, I take Quizon’s statements with a grain of salt.So what’s the real story behind Tatlong Bibe?Let’s pretend that Tatlong Bibe’s history is one life-changing issue, and I, ThinkingPinoy, will go on a short quest to unravel the mystery., let’s listen to Tatlong Bibe’s lyric video posted 18 December 2012:The first several lines of the song are:, I searched using the keyword phrase “ tatlong bibe english ” and we discover [ Mamalisa ] that the lines above have an English translation that reads:Moreover, scrolling down the article’s comments section, you will see that somebody said Three Ducks was actually a sub-section of the English (UK) children’s rhyme Six Little Ducks., I searched using the keyword phrase “ Six Little Ducks song” and I found that it was actually broadcast on 31 July 2015 on the children’s TV show Mother Goose Club.Mother Goose Club is broadcast over the American PBS network [ PBS-MGC ]., I searched for the earliest youtube video about six little ducks,and the earliest I can find was posted on 21 December 2006Youtube itself was officially launched on December 2005 [ Telegraph ], so it’s likely that this may be the earliest Six Little Ducks online video. However, the video description credited a certain artist with the name “Raffi”., Six Little Ducks is in Raffi’s 1977 album “More Singable Songs” [ RaffiNews ]. Raffi (Full name: Raffi Cavoukian) is a well-known Egyptian-Canadian children’s entertainer who was appoint to the Order of British Columbia in 2001 [ OBC ]., The song, regardless of the translation, uses the following melody [ Anderson 2013 ]., a 30 May 1976 New York Times review described “Six Little Ducks” as “an old, familiar song” [ NYTimes ]. Assuming that the youngest NY Times columnist is 25 years old, this implies that “Six Little Ducks” should have already been popular in the United States in the 1950s at the latest.and googling a little further, ThinkingPinoy discovered that the same melody of the 1944/1945 song “Bell Bottom Trousers” was used for Six Little Ducks [ Averill 2014 ].: While Bell Bottom Trousers is the first recording of the said melody, that melody was actually a simplified version of the English (UK) song “Rosemary Lane”[ FSU ].Here’s a 1960s Anne Briggs cover of the UK folk song Rosemary Lane:, Rosemary Lane is a ballad written in the early 1800s [ Prineppi 2015 Let’s recall what we have discussed:Again, let’s ask the question:No, it didn’t originate from the Philippines. It’s from the UK.This entire article took me an hour and a half to research, write, and publish. That’s far shorter than interviewing a “Linguistic Studies Expert”.

"A new car would cost around P500,000 more if the proposed tax reform of the Duterte administration was passed into law, Camarines Sur Rep. Rolando Andaya warned on Monday.Andaya, one of the House Deputy Speakers, was referring to a provision of the tax reform program that imposes an excise tax of 40 percent of the net manufacturing importation price for cars priced over P1.1 million to P2.1 million–up from the existing excise tax rate of P112,00 plus the value in excess of P1.1 million for the bracket.“A [Toyota] Innova would cost P400,000 more, while a [Mitsubishi] Montero would cost P600,000 more. For a Pajero, you could pay P1 million more. So if you can purchase a car now before this [tax measure] is passed, the better,” he told reporters.The proposed tax measure also imposes a five percent of the net manufacturing/importation price as excise tax on cars priced P600,000 and below–a few notches more than the existing two percent.This would mean that a compact car worth P590,000 based on net manufacturing/importation price will be worth P619,000 or up from its old price of P601,800 (including the two percent of the net manufacturing/importation excise tax).Cars priced over P600,000 to P1.1 million, on the other hand, will incur a 20 percent excise tax instead of an existing income tax rate of P12,000 plus excess of P600,000 net price.Those priced over P2.1 million will have a 60 percent excise tax instead of the rate of P512,000 at present plus the value in excess of P2.1 million.",1
"Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said “everyone should be alarmed” by the killing of lawyer Jonnah John Ungab Monday near the city courthouse.Sereno expressed her concern when she was in Cebu recently for the Convention of Clerk of Courts and a dialogue with students from six law schools in Cebu.Ungab, who was also vice mayor of Ronda town, was gunned down by a motorcycle-riding assailant minutes after he attended a hearing for his client, suspected drug lord Kerwin Espinosa.“For any country in the world, when killings are done brazenly, every citizen must ask where society is headed towards. Is this a breakdown that we are seeing?” Sereno said.She said she talked to Executive Judge Gilbert Moises of the Regional Trial Court in Cebu City on putting up additional security in the courthouse.“We will augment the security that we have. There is really a need to keep judges and lawyers safe.

"The Commission on Audit (COA) has affirmed its notice of disallowance on P6.05 million worth of grocery incentives issued by nine National Food Authority (NFA) officials to themselves.The notice covered food and grocery incentives issued by NFA officials Beverlyn Peralta of Ilocos Norte, Fortunato Bulao of Ilocos Sur, Ramon Cuaresma of Eastern Pangasinan, Ronaldo Rufo of Western Pangasinan, Cecilia Concubierta of Benguet, Miguel Tecson of Kalinga, Roberto Gonzales of Batangas, Ruben Manatad of Eastern Samar and Zaldy Tan of Southern Leyte.The COA found the consolidated petitions for review of the officials devoid of merit, saying the grant of incentives violates Section 2, Administrative Order (AO) No. 37, s. 1998, which provides that “heads of national government agencies, local government units, government owned and controlled corporations (GOCC) and government financial institutions (GFI) as well as their respective governing boards are prohibited from authorizing/granting Amelioration Assistance or any other similar benefit without prior approval and authorization via Administrative Order by the Office of the President.”“Henceforth, anyone found violating any of the provisions of this Order, including all officials/employees and the COA Resident Auditor of such government entity found to have taken part thereof, will be accordingly and severely dealt with in accordance with the applicable provisions of existing administrative and penal laws,” the commission said.“Consequently, all administrative authorizations granting any and all forms of additional compensation paid outside of the prescribed basic salary under Compensation and Position Classification Act that are inconsistent with the legislated policy on the matter or are not covered by any legislative action are hereby revoked,” it added.It cited the Department of Budget and Management’s order banning all agencies “from granting any food, rice, gift checks or any other form of incentives/allowances except those authorized via Administrative Order by the Office of the President.”The agency also junked the defense of the respondents that the incentive was allowed by former Presidents Joseph Estrada and Macapagal-Arroyo.“The letter dated December 8, 1998 of the former NFA Administrator bearing the signature of former President Estrada was not the authority sanctioned by the aforecited administrative orders and Budget Department circular. Thus, it cannot be the basis for the grant of the incentives. Even assuming that the said letter constitutes authority for the grant, the approval applied only for the year 1998 and not to succeeding years” the COA pointed out.“Good faith cannot be appreciated in favor of the NFA personnel concerned, considering that from the start, they were aware of the infirmity on the grant of the incentives in view of the Deed of Undertaking they executed, authorizing the Accounting Department to deduct from their salaries and other benefits the amount they received without the necessity of demand, in case the incentives would be disallowed in audit thereafter,” it added.",1
"#If anyone doubts the courage and commitment of young people amid the rising tyranny we see today, you got yourselves a remarkable answer.Last January 6, the country’s biggest youth groups convened a National Youth Summit Against Dictatorship to tackle the looming threat emanating from the current regime. And they held it not in Manila, but in Davao City.The summit was hosted by the UP’s Office of the Student Regent (OSR) in partnership with the College Editors Guild of the Philippines, the National Union of Students of the Philippines, and the alliance Youth Act Now Against Tyranny.The organizers asked me and others to send a message to the youth and student leaders gathered in the summit. And I’m happy to share it with you, dear readers, and I hope it reaches more young people:“Thanks to the organizers of this Youth Summit Against Dictatorship especially to the CEGP, the epicenter of my youth activism and committed writing.“I am humbled by the invitation to send you a message. Humbled because your summit is in itself a powerful message to all the young ones and the “once young” that we need to come together now and fight the single-biggest problem of the nation: the wannabe dictatorship of Rodrigo Duterte. At sa Dabaw pa talaga kayo nagtipon. Astig.“But since you asked me for a message, here it is: There are three areas that I wish the youth would also focus on, right here and right now.“First, the Internet and social media. They are both media where lots of debates happen and also an emerging center to organize people. The forces of misinformation and dictatorship appear to have an upper hand in this new media, and they use it to demonize the young people either as sellout intellectuals or as addicts or communists. Some say we must fight fire with fire, but I hope we instead seize the political and moral high ground.“The Internet and social media provide young people new opportunities we never had before: You could set up libraries of reference and educational materials. You could have TV channels and radio/podcast stations, with programs that would showcase the dynamism, intelligence and brilliance of young people. You could have online newspapers and news magazines. You could set up a youth news agency. The biggest youth organizations and alliances, and the youth party, could mobilize its members to start, expand and make these projects successful. Without such projects, we would cede the Internet and social media to those who wish to make it serve merely as another media or force for awfulness.“Second, promote the democratic and nationalist praxis of youth activism. Our people are being inundated by messages of hopelessness, cynicism and surrender. And a growing number of young people are reportedly falling into depression, anxiety and other mental health issues arising from personal, family and social concerns.“Activism’s call to service and sacrifice is waiting to be heard online and offline. The good news of activism are that another world is possible, that hope trumps greed, and that it is the most potent tool for individual and social transformation. Activism also supports comprehensive health programs.“Activism doesn’t produce anti-trolls. It doesn’t depress, it inspires. It calls on activists to self-examine, to help each other, and to serve. It produces a movement that not only makes sense of what’s happening, but also agitates for action to change the nation and the world for the better. It ultimately produces thinkers, doers, fighters, heroes. It gives our people, especially the youth, a most admirable vision and a most delectable aspiration. So much unlike the dog-eat-dog mindset that depresses, and the hero worship that perpetuates awful politics.“Third, open the youth movement’s doors wide to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer youth and students! They are waiting to be called to be heard, to be included, to participate and to lead! They also dream of a better, truly democratic future!“Invite their organizations, and form LGBT desks or chapters. Fight discrimination in schools, communities and workplaces. Expand the youth programs to include issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. Invite and seek out leaders from the LGBTs.“Activism is against all forms of exploitation and oppression. It is something about activism that LGBTs would gravitate to and surely have lots to contribute.“Thank you again for the opportunity to send you a message in this gathering in Davao.“In summary: Make the Internet and social media your new headquarters. Promote the values of service and sacrifice amid the cynical and depressing times. Expand the movement to include the LGBTs. These could and would help you slay the monster that is the fascist dictatorship.“Message sent.“Truly yours,Tito Tonyo Cruz”Youth and student groups interested to join the alliance Youth Act Now Against Tyranny could get in touch with them through its Facebook Page at facebook.com/youthactnowphilsFollow me on Twitter @tonyocruz and check out my blog tonyocruz.com",1
"Noynoy is just another bozo who just happened to have walked into our crosshairs and flashed his iconically moronic “L” sign once too often. These are crosshairs that have remained consistently focused on only one thing — aspects of Da Pinoy that account for our chronic inability to prosper as a society. So it’s nothing personal folks. Trabaho lang. Whether or not Noynoy stays within those crosshairs for the next six years is largely up to him.I’ve always called politicians “bozos”. And for the record I personally consider Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III a bozo’s bozo. Add me to a box of “witchhunters” then, given this categorical declaration coming from me. Noynoy is in a class of politicians probably occupied by only two men — him and former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada. Between the two of them, they embody 99% of the renowned dysfunction of Filipino culture many of us here have been writing about for the past 10 years.But whilst Erap represented that perverse machissmo that characterises the misguided aspirations of the average Pinoy male, Noynoy so effectively complements this “macho” persona by representing the emo wussy side of the Filipino — the side that predisposes us to an addiction to melodrama, telenovelas, nauseating romantically-charged ballads, and that world-renowned crybaby victim mentality that served as the bedrock upon which Noynoy’s campaign was mounted.Indeed;Noynoy is the Yang that completes Erap’s Yin.Get Real Post.@JoeAmerica: I don't know what your obssession is with this notion that GRP is out campaigning to ""oust"" Noynoy. I speak for myself when I say that I have always been for Noynoy serving his entire term. And I believe none of the GRP writers as far as I have seen have advocated removing him from Malacanang unconstitutionally. In fact, Filipinos shouldto be subject to the Noynoy presidency for the full six year term. FilipinosNoynoy, because they voted for him.We remain exceedinglynot just in our focus on Noynoy's idiocracy but on the idiocracy of the broader society of Filipinos his presidency reflects. What I wrote back in June of 2010 , for example, may as well have been written today...As to how he is different from other Filipino politicians, well he isn't in a broad context. But narrow that context down to an evaluation within the set of politicians he is now part of (the rarefied set consisting of those who had served as Presidents) and Noynoy clearly comes up as a real chump...You can't escape the reality of Noynoy's being a standout bozo, Joe. Perhaps, as another guy here said, you are among the more intelligent, articulate, and well-read among Noynoy's supporters. But that puts you in an even more tragic class of your own -- because time and again, it's been quite evident that exceptional intelligence is so obviously incompatible with being a Nonoyist. What does that make you? Simple. Inconsistent. And that ultimately is the source of your failure to earn the respect of people here... which is why you instead seek the comfort of people like yourself who comment on your blog -- articulate people but Noynoy supporters nonetheless: your partners in inconsistency and, as such, failed thought leader wannabes.",0
"The Armed Forces of the Philippines is investigating the killing of seven young men suspected to be members of the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu province last week whose relatives have vehemently denied their links to the bandit group, the military’s top investigator said on Thursday.“We are directed by our Chief of Staff (Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr.) to conduct this investigation in Patikul and we want to find out the truth and to give justice to all,” Lt. Gen. Rafael Valencia, the AFP inspector general, told the Inquirer.Permission to harvestIn a phone call to the Inquirer, Valencia, who was in Zamboanga City, said several of his staff flew to Sulu on Thursday to begin the investigation.The seven who were killed, including a minor, had sought permission from the 45th Infantry Battalion to harvest lanzones and durian from their farm at Sitio Bato, Barangay Kabuntakas, Patikul town, on Sept. 14.The next day, relatives who learned about their deaths, recovered their bullet-riddled bodies at the headquarters of the Joint Task Force Sulu in Jolo, Sulu, where soldiers said they were Abu Sayyaf bandits who had clashed with government troops.Accounts of witnessesThree witnesses, however, said that even before the fruit pickers reached their farm around 11 a.m., they saw the group already in the custody of Army Scout Rangers from the 32nd Infantry Battalion.Col. Gerry Besana, public affairs officer of the Western Mindanao Command, said there was a “legitimate” encounter between Task Group Panther under Lt. Col. Samuel Yunque and Capt. Michael Asistores of the Scout Rangers and more than 100 Abu Sayyaf bandits under Radulan Sahiron at around 1:30 p.m. on Sept. 14.Aiza Salakadang Casimra, an information officer for the Regional Human Rights Commission of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, said her agency was conducting its own investigation and had dispatched a team to Patikul on Sunday.Speaking to the Inquirer, Mahmur Arula said the victims were his cousins—Alpadal Diray, 16; Makrub Diray, 25; Mijar Hairan and Basiluddin Hairani, 30; Issah Hamsan, 21; Benajal Tula and Maknun Sakirin, 22.“They were not terrorists. They were just trying to earn a living by harvesting their own crops in that area,” Arula said.Congressional inquiryAt the House of Representatives, members of the Makabayan bloc and several other representatives early this week sought a congressional inquiry into the killing of the seven young men.In a resolution filed on Tuesday, the lawmakers called on the House human rights committee to investigate the incident because of the conflicting claims of the military and the relatives of the victims.The resolution was signed by Kabataan Rep. Sara Jane Elago, Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao, Gabriela Representatives Arlene Brosas and Emmi de Jesus; Act Teachers Representatives France Castro and Antonio Tinio, and Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate.Zambales Rep. Cheryl Deloso-Montalla, chair of the human rights committee, and Tawi-Tawi Rep. Ruby Sahali, chair of the committee on peace, reconciliation and unity, and vice chair of the committees on Mindanao affairs and on Muslim affairs, also signed the resolution.Apparently informed that the Scout Rangers involved were on a “test mission” at the time, Sahali said she wanted to know whether it was true that the troops, “before they graduate, needed to kill some Abu Sayyaf.”“There would be no problem if they truly were Abu Sayyaf. But what if they killed innocent people?” Sahali said.She said the inquiry could start after the budget hearings.Threat to Inquirer reporterValencia, the AFP inspector general, appealed to people in Sulu to cooperate with the military investigation.He also said he came across some Facebook posts that slammed and threatened Inquirer reporter Julie Alipala, who reported about the claims by relatives of the victims that they were innocent.“We are also alarmed how some people are harassing journalists who are performing their job,” Valencia said. “We would also like to find out who are behind those threats against a reporter and if threats are coming from active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.”In a letter to Undersecretary Joel Sy Egco, head of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security, Inquirer executive editor Jose Ma. D. Nolasco asked for an investigation and to “unmask the people behind the irresponsible posts” against Alipala.“The Philippine Daily Inquirer views with grave concern this online attack on Ms Alipala,” Nolasco said.“We fear for her safety, especially in this age when social media posts are used to summon an army of trolls to destroy a perceived enemy’s reputation and incite misguided fanatics to murder.”PHIL LEAKSThe Facebook page, PHIL LEAKS: Huwag Tularan, on Sept. 17 accused Alipala of being a “Certified Bayarang Kulumnista ng mga teroristang Abu Sayyaf Group.”Some of those who commented posted outright threats against Alipala. A certain Ricardo Macapagal said, “Tokhang yan.” Another, Rhoel Dispo, posted: “Dpat barilin na yan sa ulo.” Bong Medina said, “dapat ito ang na aambush.”PHIL LEAKS had targeted political activists, many of them belonging to left-leaning groups and other so-called enemies of the state.In a letter to her editors, Alipala said: “I just can’t imagine [that] a reporter diligently doing his or her job, taking all sides of the coin for a complete story, will be labeled a terrorist.”Nolasco said the Inquirer “vouches for the integrity of Ms Alipala and stands by her story.”“She is among our veteran reporters covering community issues, crime, insurgency, and conflict and peace initiatives in Mindanao since 1998,” Nolasco said.",1
"Members of the consultative committee, which drafted a new Constitution, rebuked the government’s economic managers for painting a bleak picture of the planned shift to federalism without doing their job of helping craft the proposed Charter in the first place.In recent days, President Rodrigo Duterte’s economic team, led by Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, said the shift to the federal system under the draft charter could lead to massive spending cuts, layoffs of up to 95 percent of public sector employees, a bigger budget deficit and a downgrade in the country’s credit ratings.“We need to know how they arrived at these figures? What assumptions were made based on the provisions of the draft Constitution?” consultative committee spokesperson Ding Generoso said on Saturday.“We might have different assumptions—because our computations do not reflect the figures cited by [the] Department of Finance (DOF),” he said.Committee member and San Beda Graduate School of Law dean Fr. Ranhilio Aquino indicated that Dominguez and others in the President’s economic team only gave half-hearted support to the charter deliberations where their concerns could have been tackled.Repeatedly invited“Let everyone know that during the sessions of the [committee], Secretary Dominguez was invited repeatedly but he chose not to appear, dispatching instead his underlings who could not or would not provide helpful answers. He should have raised his issues and made his suggestions then,” the law dean said in a Facebook post on Friday.Executive Order No. 10, which created the committee, “directed” all government entities, agencies and instrumentalities “to render assistance for the committee to carry out its mandate.”Arturo Aguilar, the only economist and businessman in the committee, said: “It would have been great to hear [these apprehensions from the economic managers] when we were drafting the fiscal provisions.”“We got no help from the economic managers in spite of formal letters. In one hearing, undersecretaries of [the] DOF, DBM (Department of Budget and Management) and Neda (National Economic and Development Authority) showed up. We asked for data and advice. They never came back,” said Aguilar, who chaired the committee’s economic reforms and fiscal administration group.Experts outside gov’tBecause there was no help from the economic managers, Aguilar said fellow committee member Prof. Edmund Tayao had to consult public finance experts outside the government and the academe in coming up with the recommendations on tax sharing provisions in the draft charter.The draft constitution proposes the creation of a federal intergovernment commission with the country’s economic managers as members, according to Aguilar.“They will be running the show. So what are they talking about when they will be the ones in charge of the transition? They will be the ones who will determine the pace of the transition,” he said.Several senators, however, said the administration should not ignore the warning from its own economic managers.“Instead of outrightly rejecting it, it should encourage more critical and intellectual discussions to level up the debate on federalism,” Sen. Joel Villanueva said.Sen. Francis Pangilinan, who chairs the Senate Committee on Constitutional Amendments, was particularly worried about the possible loss of jobs for 95 percent of the national government’s 1.46 million employees, or about 1.387 million people.The job losses would be “too much a price to pay for charter change, as proposed,” he said.Pimentel: Nothing to fearSen. Aquilino Pimentel III, a supporter of federalism, dismissed such fears.“Nobody will be unemployed,” he said in a radio interview on Saturday. “There will be those who will move from the national government to the regional government.”He said infrastructure projects would also continue under the proposed regional governments.Deficits, he added, should not be raised as an issue against the shift to federalism because the country had them even under the current unitary system.“What I’m getting from [the economic managers] is that they need more information. So the con-com (consultative committee), which still exists, should give the data being asked for,” he said.Malacañang was not alarmed by the opinions of the economic managers on the draft Constitution.“As we have said, we encourage a healthy discussion regarding the draft federal Constitution,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement on Saturday.",1
"Sometimes you have to call a spade a spade and honestly declare that the President was never prepared or fit to lead our country. In fact, the devastation and problems the country has been encountering, one after the other, the Zamboanga siege, that botched hostage crisis, our row with China, the natural disasters, and unresponsiveness of government, they point to terrible leadership or to be on the point, a real lack of it. While blessings are great, I don't think prayers alone will cut it. We should be spared of that man's ineptness. I don't think our country can suffer through 2-3 more years of Noynoy.Also, what good does that credit rating do in the practical, day to day sense? Prices of fuel and goods are up. Infrastructure projects are halted, overpriced, or not present. The so-called rice security that this administration has been touting is a sham. There is no planning going on in the NDRCC (or whatever alphabet soup agency) as witnessed by the slow response of gov't to the typhoon Yolanda victims. It even took the president forever and a day to decide to declare a state of calamity in Tacloban and he even indulged in a little blaming on the side. That is simply unacceptable. The funny thing is, you see and hear these pieces of news daily on the radio and the broadsheets. The information and commentary there, however, isn't as in your face as it is presented here. And you know why, for the most part, either these press people are politically affiliated with the president or were cowed by this particular president's vindictiveness and supreme disregard for press freedom.For all the jabs thrown out to Marcos and the martial law era, at least the latter was legally declared and the streets were more orderly. Today, we have an undeclared martial law that is, in the colloquial: ""palpak."" Martial law you say? Well, you have president who controls the executive branch, uses money (pork, pdaf, and whatever creative acronyms they use that amount to the same thing) and intimidation to secure the cooperation of the legislative, and outright disregard for the judiciary.Case in point, arbitrarily banning people from leaving the country without charges being pressed. Hell, the president replaced the previous chief justice with one of his own choosing, inexperience and seniority be damned. So, while it is generous of you to bless the fellow, it doesn't really change the facts on the ground. Also, his so-called economic achievements are simply the successes of the previous administration. And, finally, soup kitchens and dole-outs aren't going to cut it in getting our fellow Filipino's lives back on track. No disrespect, but I hope this overlong post puts things in perspective. If anyone wants proof, Google is your friend. Read and actually understand the implications of the news.Source:http://getrealphilippines.com/blog/2013/03/five-reasons-why-filipinos-blame-noynoy-aquino-for-everything/comment-page-3/#comment-155505",0
"Sen. Bam Aquino on Saturday said he believed his cousin, President Aquino, was “ultimately responsible” for the Mamasapano operation that led to the deaths of 44 Special Action Force (SAF) police commandos in the hands of Muslim rebels, “because of his being the commander in chief.”But the senator said the President should not apologize simply because he was being pressured to say “sorry.”Aquino said he signed the Senate report on its Mamasapano inquiry which included the President among the officials held responsible for the botched secret operation to arrest international terrorists in Maguindanao, but did not agree with some parts of the report.“Even on the President’s responsibility as commander in chief, I agree with that. But there are some parts which I do not agree with so I put a note of reservation and amendment when I signed [the document],” he said.The senator did not elaborate on what parts he wanted amended.Aquino was here to meet with 50 student leaders and to promote a youth entrepreneurship program in the city.He defended the President against criticism of his handling of the Mamasapano operation, saying his cousin had worked hard to deliver justice and provide benefits to the families of the slain SAF men.Asked if the President should apologize, the senator said: “It is hard to say sorry. People may later say that he only asked for forgiveness because of his low trust ratings. If he would ever apologize, it should be expressed in some other manner.”–Villamor Visaya Jr., Inquirer Northern Luzon",1

"To ensure quality education and less stress for teachers, the Philippines should adopt an educational system that features small classes, according to a Cebu-based educator.Ronaldo Nobleza, founding director of EC2 Excellence Academy, said class size matters in the learning of students because if a class is too big many students will not be able to absorb the lesson no matter how good the teacher is.“We will change the system so that one day the norm will be small-sized classrooms, similar to Finland where the ratio is seven students to one teacher,” Nobleza said.EC2 Excellence Academy is a non-stock, non-profit school for children aged 6 to 12 that features individualized education, small class size format and experiential methodology.The school limits a class to 10 to 12 students for grade school and two teachers per eight students in pre-school, Nobleza said.“We want to produce lesser stress for teachers and much happier parents on top of producing well-educated students,” he said.Nobleza said officials of the Department of Education have taken notice of the EC2 system.He added that while increasing the salaries of public and private school teachers is a good idea, a smaller class will be less stressful for teaches and ensure that the students will be well-managed and attended to.“Our system is an alternative to the current big classroom sizes that deprive kids of much needed attention and home-schooling that deprives children some opportunities for socialization,” Nobleza said.",1
"“A grade is just a number,” said Tiffany Grace Uy, shrugging off the distinction of getting the highest postwar weighted average grade (WAG) from the University of the Philippines (UP).READ: Biology student breaks highest grade record in post-war UPUy’s WAG of 1.004 surpassed the previous record set by John Gabriel Pelias, a BS Mathematics graduate, who got 1.016.“It’s only circumstantial evidence of what you’ve learned,” added the 22-year-old Biology graduate. “A true measure of what you’ve learned is (its) application toward serving the country.”Not surprisingly, this overachiever is on her way to doing just that, have received an award for best undergraduate thesis for her research on resistance to breast cancer.“Breast cancer incidence is particularly high in the Philippines. Not only is the incidence high, but we also have a very low survival rate,” Uy told the Inquirer in an interview. “So I want to study the resistance mechanism. I want to overcome it.”She plans to channel her passion for cancer research into medical studies, added this Oblation Scholar.Oblation ScholarOblation Scholars, the top 50 qualifiers of the UP College Admission Test, are entitled to free tuition and miscellaneous fees, plus book, transportation and incentive allowances.Uy, one of the university’s 29 summa cum laudes this year, will lead 4,431 other graduates during this year’s graduation ceremonies at UP Diliman, Quezon City, on Sunday.“There’s too much expectation,” she said. “I have a huge responsibility to prove myself, not through words, but rather through my career in the future as a doctor. I really want to serve the Filipino nation.”At the recognition rites at the Institute of Biology on Friday, such ponderous words apparently had no place, as the well-liked top graduate horsed around with her batchmates who took turns having a selfie taken with her. “For when you’ve become famous,” they said.That might come sooner than expected, as already, Uy has become popular on social media for acing all her subjects, except Art Studies 1 where she got a grade of 1.25.“I don’t think she will have sleepless nights because of that GE (general education). She thought her grade was OK,” said Uy’s program adviser, Ian Kendrich Fontanilla, who added that the top student is also “very humble and helpful to her classmates.”Struggling artist“I actually found it kinda funny,” Uy said of her grade. “I realized I had a long way to go in art studies, (so) I opted to take ArtStud 2 the following semester and found it a blast. It awakened the struggling artist inside me.”Uy said she never aspired to get 1 in all her subjects. “I have this idea that no matter what subject it is, it’s the knowledge that I can use to help in the future that’s worth it.”In fact, she added, she personally believes she’s “not too bright.”“What takes a regular person one reading to understand can take me three or 10 (readings). I really study late into the night,” she said.Studying at UP exposed her to social injustices that also frustrated her because, as a student, she felt there was little she could do, Uy recalled.“I wanted to graduate earlier so I’d become a doctor sooner,” Uy said. The next best thing, she found out, was “joining medical missions organized by our church to help the community.”‘A doctor made me feel safe’Uy’s parents, both of them doctors, inspired her to become one, she said, though the decisive factor was the memory of getting stitches for a head cut when she was 6.“I was awake when I had the stitches and I was scared. But I remember the doctor making me feel safe. And I wanted to be that kind of person whom people can run to for help and comfort, especially in their darkest hour,” Uy said.“I felt like that would make for a meaningful life,” she added.Come August, Uy starts her studies at the UP College of Medicine. In the meantime, she’s spending her vacation doing more laboratory work to fine-tune her thesis on cancer for possible publication in a journal.“(My professors) want me to publish (my thesis),” she said. “Of course, it’s a very rudimentary thing because I’m just an undergrad student. What I’m doing is just the edge of the edge of the icing. (But) I hope if I publish it, others will gain information,” she added.Despite her academic feats, Uy is as normal as anyone her age: Finding time to scuba dive (“I recently got licensed.”), maintaining a relationship with her boyfriend of six years, watching animé cartoons and treasuring a Pikachu stuffed toy from her grandmother.",1
"Defenseless victims of a police rubout.That’s how the National Bureau of Investigation summed up on Tuesday the Nov. 5 killings of Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. and another inmate in the Leyte subprovincial jail.The NBI said it had recommended the filing of multiple murder charges against Supt.

"From a “lightweight” fight in 2010, it will be a “welterweight” showdown for the 2016 presidential election between him and Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, Vice President Jejomar Binay said on Thursday.Binay said he was counting on his “lucky punch” to win again against Roxas, the way he beat the latter in the vice presidential race in 2010.Speaking to reporters in Cavite City, Binay was asked to comment on the official endorsement of Roxas by President Benigno Aquino III on Friday as the ruling coalition’s standard-bearer .‘You’ve seen surveys’The Vice President said that at least the question of whether Roxas would run for president was settled.Asked whether he had a better chance of winning against Roxas in a two-way fight, Binay said he did not want to brag “but you have seen the surveys.”READ: Roxas on Binay run: Filipinos are smart votersHe was referring to surveys showing he continued until recently to top polls on voter’s preference for the next president while Roxas continued to lag behind.Like boxingTold that this would not be the first time they would be fighting each other for an elective post, he said: “Yes, but in a different way. If in boxing, previously it was lightweight, now perhaps it’s welterweight.”So can he replicate the outcome of his lightweight fight against Roxas in 2016? “My lucky punch is still there,” Binay said.Binay said that in every election that he joined, he always felt he was the underdog that was why he had to “fight and fight.”On his advantage over his possible foes in May, he said the issues in the 2016 elections would be experience, capability and love for the people of the next leader.RELATED STORIESRoxas tells Binay: Answer allegations, don’t divert issuesHSBC: Roxas’ 2016 chances improve after Binay ratings fell",1

Gloria Macapagal Arroyo yesterday reiterated that she should be placed under house arrest.In an eight-page reply to the prosecution’s opposition, Arroyo’s counsels told the Sandiganbayan First Division that Enrile and the former president are “similarly situated” as both are already sickly and are not considered flight risk.The defense also cited the case of former President and now Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada, whose request to be held at his sprawling rest house in Tanay, Rizal, was granted by the antigraft court while he was being tried for plunder.Arroyo, 68, had been in hospital detention at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) in Quezon City since October 2012 after she was indicted for plunder over the purported misuse of P366 million in intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office.“If bail may be granted on grounds of unlikelihood of flight and/or poor health, then it stands to reason that [Arroyo’s] present custodial arrangement may be modified to transfer the place of her detention from the [VMMC] to her residence in Quezon City or Lubao, Pampanga,” Arroyo’s lawyers argued.Fragile health“[Arroyo] and Senator Enrile are similarly situated,” the petition read. “Like Senator Enrile, [she] is also of fragile health and is a nonflight risk.”Enrile, who is facing plunder and graft charges over the P10-billion pork barrel racket, was purportedly known as “Tanda” (old) in the records of the scam’s alleged mastermind, Janet Lim-Napoles.The 91-year-old senator was able to secure his provisional liberty on Aug. 18 after eight justices of the high tribunal voted to approve his bail petition on humanitarian grounds.Arroyo’s lawyers told the court that government doctors had certified that she had yet to “fully recover” from a debilitating age-related bone ailment and that she underwent three major spinal surgeries.They said the government prosecutors’ claim that Arroyo’s petition for house arrest had no legal basis was “without merit.”“But unlike Senator Enrile, [Arroyo] is not asking for bail … but simply that her current custodial arrangement be modified,” they said.RELATED STORIESPalace fears Gloria Arroyo, others nextArroyo asks court anew to dismiss plunder case",1
"There should be no mercy for policemen engaged in “tokhang for ransom,” Sen. Panfilo Lacson said on Tuesday as he scored the “slow” and “soft” action of the Philippine National Police on the officer implicated in the abduction of a South Korean businessman who has been missing since October.Lacson, a former PNP chief, said President Duterte should move to rid the police force of officers who abuse the government’s war on drugs.“The PNP leadership should show no mercy to policemen who engage in ‘hulidap’ and kidnap-extortion cases who take advantage of the government’s no-nonsense efforts against drug offenders,” he said.“They destroy the image and credibility of the entire police force,” said the lawmaker, who in November last year denounced the operation of “ninja cops” undertaking kidnap-extortion activities targeting Chinese-Filipino businessmen.Lacson’s statement came as the wife of missing Jee Ick-joo renewed her appeal to PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa to find her husband, three months since he was kidnapped from his home.The Inquirer first reported Jee’s case on the weekend. It came as the PNP credited Mr. Duterte’s tough anticrime stance for a general drop in crime.The President has vowed to protect police officers from criminal prosecution, as his war on drugs left more than 6,000 dead since he assumed power six months ago.“Tokhang” is a Filipino combination word that stands for “knock” and “plead.” Police officers would rap on a suspect’s door and ask him to stop using illegal drugs and join community-organized exercise activities.And while the government has insisted the program has been effective, the PNP is known to have a long history of corruption, and crooked officers apparently are using the President’s vow as cover for their illicit deeds.Jee, a 53-year-old businessman and a former director of a South Korean firm, was seized on Oct. 18 last year at his home in Angeles City by a team led by an antinarcotics officer, who has been relieved pending an investigation.Jee, however, has not been found, and his distraught wife has been forced to seek help, including from President Duterte and Dela Rosa.An earlier investigation by the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group (PNP-AKG) has recommended the investigation of a police officer, four other companions and several “John Does” in the kidnapping.Restrictive custodyDela Rosa said the suspect police officer, assigned at the PNP Anti-Illegal Drugs Group, was already under restrictive custody.“We are not condoning (the abduction). If it’s proven that he was responsible, he doesn’t deserve any day in this organization,” he said on Monday.The Inquirer has decided to withhold the name of the suspect policeman as requested by Jee’s wife, Choi Kyung-jin, who said she continued to fear for her husband’s safety and that of her family.Lacson, who headed the now defunct Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force that handled abduction cases, stressed the suspects should already be in detention.“Relief is a mere administrative remedy. By now, due process already factored in, those involved should have been summarily dismissed and incarcerated for a nonbailable offense of kidnapping for ransom,” said Lacson, chair of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs.The PNP action “is not only slow but too soft on such kind of misconduct and criminal act being perpetrated by people who are supposed to enforce the law,” he said.Deep anxietyChoi said Dela Rosa’s statement has given her reason to hope. “Dela Rosa’s promise is a great hope for me,” she told the Inquirer on Monday.“I want you to focus on finding my husband and for an accurate and thorough investigation. If you can find only my husband, I have nothing to wish for. I hope to see my husband soon,” she appealed to Dela Rosa.The South Korean Embassy, in a statement to the Inquirer, said the case had “caused deep anxiety” among the 90,000 South Koreans living and working in the country.“We take this case very seriously and with urgency,” the embassy said. “We are very much concerned about the security of our kidnapping victim. We very much look forward to his release as soon as possible.”The embassy urged the PNP “to conduct a swift and thorough investigation into the case.”KidnappingJee was taken by the gunmen who barged into his home announcing a drug raid. They also took some P540,000 worth of jewelry and other personal items from his house.He and his house helper were taken out of his village inside his own car. The incident was captured by the neighbor’s security camera. It showed a black pickup truck that belonged to the officer’s wife.Helper Marisa Dawis was released the following day, but Jee has yet to be found, although his wife paid a ransom of P5 million on Oct. 31 without telling police investigators assigned to the case.",1
"Geisler took to social media once again and posted a video of himself all bruised up in the face. He tells his followers that he was just attacked by his brother-in-law and sisters because of 'money issues'.Perhaps due to his being still a bit shaken from what he just experienced, he failed to elaborate on his story. He did say that his brother-in-law named Mark Morales and his own sisters barged in (his home) and beat the living daylights out him. His face bruises still looks fresh and raw like newly applied prosthetic make up on actors, so we can only assume that he took the video shortly after the beatings.He also showed blood still dripping from his nose to the camera while he asks his social media followers for help on what course of action he should take.But what really happened? The video seem to pose more questions than answers.What money issues? Who owes who? Was it inheritance money? Debt built up from debauchery? Were they drunk? Is this another elaborate publicity stunt? Are we seeing a Baron Geisler versus brother-in-law in a cage match?Anyway, here's the video of Baron Geisler showing his battered face to the public.Actor Baron Geisler is known to be involved in at least one controversy every year. From drunken altercation with bouncers at clubs to beating college filmmakers and staging fake brawls with fellow actor. This year, the brawl he just from was with his own sister and brother-in-law and it seem more real this time.",0
"The Duterte administration’s plan to replace barangay (village) officials with appointed officers-in-charge (OIC) is illegal, an opposition lawmaker said on Tuesday.Rep. Edcel Lagman of Albay cited Section 8, Article 10 of the Constitution that states, “The term of office of elective local officials, except barangay officials, which shall be determined by law, shall be three years and no such official shall serve for more than three consecutive terms. Voluntary renunciation of the office for any length of time shall not be considered as an interruption in the continuity of his service for the full term for which he was elected.”“The Duterte administration’s insistence on replacing incumbent elected barangay officials with appointive OIC is a blatant violation of the Constitution and aberration which supplants the popular electoral will. The Constitution classifies barangay officials as “local elective officials” and, consequently, they are installed in office by electoral mandate, not by appointment,” Lagman said in a statement.“Due to the classification by the Constitution of barangay officials as “elective local officials,” the various laws pertinent to the election of barangay officials provide for a hold-over,” he added.Lagman invoked Republic Act (RA) 10923 approved on October 2016 that postponed the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council) elections to the fourth Monday of October 2017 that provide for hold-over, reading, “Until their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified, all incumbent barangay officials shall remain in office, unless sooner removed or suspended for cause.”Similarly, other statutes on village elections like RA 6653 (May 1988), RA 9164 (March 2002) and RA 9340 (September 2005) also invariably provide for hold-over.The Duterte administration wants the October 2017 village elections postponed so as to rid the barangay ranks of officials who are involved in the illegal drug trade.“Barangay officials suspected of complicity in drug-related offenses or any criminal act must be prosecuted and removed for cause pursuant to law, not substituted with OIC,” Lagman said.“Hold-over provisions recognize that elected barangay officials shall remain in office until the election, not appointment, of their successors,” he added.",1
"President Duterte on Thursday confessed that he had sinned because of the extrajudicial killings that resulted from his administration’s brutal war on drugs.“Ang kasalanan ko lang, yung mga extrajudicial killings (My only sin) are the extrajudicial killings,” the President said in a speech at the oathtaking of new career executives in Malacañang.He did not elaborate.UN rapporteur“What are your sins? Me? I told the military, ‘Did I steal anything, a single centavo? Did I prosecute somebody that I jailed?’ My sin is [the] extrajudicial killings,” he said.The President slammed the United Nations’ special rapporteur for coming to the country to investigate the killings while “exercising functions, which [they] are not supposed to do, [and] belongs to government.”Duterte also hit back at his critics for accusing the government of being behind the extrajudicial killings. About 4,000 people have been killed in the war on drugs.“When, how, what did I use?” he said.",1
"In the Philippines, there is seemingly no genuine Opposition – only a loosely associated group of people who are offended by, or are excluded from, the entities who now dominate as a result of winning the last election cycle. I say “loosely” because, being politicians, they are likely to turn on each other too to advance their own personal interests.Some of my colleagues here in GRP have highlighted the use of the term “Genuine Opposition” by Senator Bam Aquino as an inadvertent admission that the Opposition against current president Rodrigo Duterte, well, has been fake. And yet one can’t help but wonder that, given how the rhetoric of the Liberal Party (LP) has a streak of being utterly divisive and exclusive, (use of “disente”, for example) the use of the term is another attempt at virtue signaling, i.e., only we who belong to this certain clique are the “genuine opposition”.If you think about it, however, the Philippines doesn’t really need a “genuine Opposition”. It needs one that is more than just hollow noise. An “Opposition” worth having to presents an alternative path that is more than just “thou shall not…”, or “if you do this, we will return to the dark past…”. The sad state of the Opposition in the Philippines, as a colleague succinctly put it, is that it is merely opposed to whoever is in power. It is not an ideological position so much as a ploy to wrest power or gain more power.And this is the backdrop against which the LP, arguably the noisiest among the current Opposition voices, is evaluated.To give credit to the LP, its members have a point in saying it will stand for a “Genuine Opposition” – but not in the way they think it means. Simply put, the LP will be genuinely opposed to anything that doesn’t abide by LP-Yellowtard dogma. The only way the term “The Resistance” will ever apply to the LP and Yellowtard led Opposition, is if it refers to their attitude towards changing the old, obsolete ways of Filipino culture and politics.And thus rings the hollowness of this apparent “rebranding exercise”:Different label, same old shit, same old characters.I wonder if anyone has noticed, but the LP and Yellowtards are fond of pop culture references to put forward their “Opposition”, whether it be the Hunger Games salute, and now The Resistance. I have yet to hear them call themselves “superheroes” or “the Avengers” however. Frankly I would prefer that Filipinos learn Defence Against the Dumb Asses to ward them Yellowtards off.Ultimately, however, one cannot discount that Filipinos’ collective memories are horribly short. By the time the next election comes around, Filipinos are most likely to forget whatever outrage they had towards certain candidates periods ago. They will also easily fall prey to threats against the integrity of their election process – whether they be in the form of outright intimidation, “incentives”, a “glitch” in the machinery used, or other external factors.Only Filipinos can change and save themselves. No one single personality, entity, or organized group can do it for them. But for them to do that, they need to move forward. They need to make mistakes, take responsibility for their actions, and learn to stay the course in the face of what benefits them the most. The alternative is to fall victim to fear, uncertainty, and doubt, and to never take an action, just because it will result in an “undesirable state”.",0
"President Duterte is mulling a ban on the deployment of overseas Filipino workers to Kuwait following the recent deaths of Filipinas in the Arab country.The President said he met with Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Cayetano on a possible total OFW deployment ban to Kuwait, asserting that the deaths of the Filipino workers were “not acceptable.”“We have lost four Filipino women in the last few months. it’s always in Kuwait so nag-usap kami ni Alan [so Alan and I talked]. It’s either, my advice is we talk to them, state the truth, and just tell them that it’s not acceptable anymore, either we impose the total ban,” Duterte said during the launch of Overseas Filipino Bank in Manila.The President also urged the Kuwaiti government to address the situation involving the welfare of Filipino workers amid reports of maltreatment.“I don’t want a quarrel with Kuwait. I respect their leaders but they have to do something about this kasi karamihan ng Pilipina mag-sucide [many of the Filipinos will commit suicide],” he added.The President’s remarks came after the family of OFW Liezl Hukdong sought the government’s assistance in uncovering the truth behind her death in Kuwait last month.Hukdong reportedly committed suicide while working for a Kuwaiti employer. The family, however, doubted the cause of death after several of her organs were discovered missing when her remains were flown back to the country.Labor Secretary SIlvestre Bello II earlier said the government was studying to stop sending Filipino workers to Kuwait following reports of maltreatment of Filipinos.",1
"Family centeredness, Politeness, Hospitality, Gratitude, Shame, Flexibility, Loyalty, Hardwork, and Resignation (Bahala na).”Since there is no law or national policy that tells us what our standard or official core values are as a country, our people interpret it on their own and come up with their respective lists of what they believe are our core values as a nation.Even our schools nationwide teach different sets of core values of the Filipinos to our students.Today, as a people, I believe that we need to have an official and standard set of national core values that can help us build and achieve the kind of society we would want for ourselves, our dream Philippines.Hopefully, that set of core values can also help develop a sense of national or cultural identity for us as a people.I propose the following as our 3 national core values in the 21st century:Kapatiran: Magkakapatid bawat PilipinoCommon Good: Kabutihan sa lahat, hindi lang sa sarili o iilanPagkakaisa: Pagsama-sama, uunlad at lalakas ang bansa.”",1
"“reality. sucks right? pagpuyo lage,tsk.”This is what Kian Shannon Sophie Cañares, 21 years old, a psychology student of the University of San Carlos, said in her last public Facebook post three days after she committed suicide by hanging herself using a wire looped around her neck.The case became more tragic when Cañares webcast her suicide to her friends on Facebook to show how she killed herself.According to the report of Cebu Daily News, Cañares live-streamed a video of her suicide on Facebook live around 9 p.m last July 3, the video showed how she hanged herself at her family’s living room in Cebu City.Shannon placed her phone on a wooden bench, about a meter from where she hanged herself to death.Two of her cousins, were disturbed after they witnessed the suicide video on Facebook. They quickly rushed to Cañares’ house to save their cousin, but it’s already late.Melencio Cañares, the father of Kian, upon hearing the disturbance went out of the master’s bedroom and discovered the lifeless hanged body of his daughter.The family quickly took down the suicide video before it became viral on the internet, fortunately no one downloaded and re uploaded the video of the suicide on the internet.But Senior Superintendent Joel Doria, director of CCPO, said that the family of Kian did not immediately report the incident to the police that prompted them to investigate deeper.The case was first reported in a local radio station in Cebu, which received the information from a concerned citizen last Tuesday.Doria said that he already ordered the investigators to talk to the people who knew Cañares, to know the real reason why Kian ended her life and even streamed it on the internet.“What we have here is a pure suicide case. There is no foul play involved especially that what she did was broadcasted live on Facebook. I hope her family will cooperate in the investigation so that we will know what were her reasons in ending her life,” he said.According to the father of Kian, who got interviewed by Cebu Daily News, Kian previously tried to commit suicide twice but they were able to stop her. Melencio also shared that Kian kept her problem to herself.They also don’t saw any sign of depression to Kian, a day before she committed suicide.(We did not see any signs that she had problems. In fact, she was laughing a day before she committed suicide),” Melencio told the Cebu Daily News.However, Melencio said that his daughter said that she saw a man with horns, several days ago.Kian also have a two year old daughter from a failed relationship, according to the reports.A veteran psychologist in Cebu Maryjun Delgado, explained that Cañares must have encountered a horrible experience.Delgado said that Cañares might have been confused and felt empty, unwanted and found no value in herself.“There might be a feeling in her that she was a victim, and so she wants everyone to know about it,” she told CDN over the phone.She added that Kian was seeking attention and wants people to understand her.Meanwhile, several relatives and friends of Kian expressed their sadness for what happened to Cañares on Facebook.There are several cases of suicide that streamed via Facebook live in other countries like U.S, but the case of Kian was the first in the Philippines.Several experts said that people must be aware on the dangers of depression. People who suffered depression should talk to a doctor or psychologist.According to Sen. Risa Hontiveros, the Philippines has the highest number of depressed people in Southeast Asia.She also filed Senate Bill no. 1190 otherwise known as the Philippine Mental Health Act of 2016 to help the people who suffered in mental health problems.“1 in 5 adult Filipinos suffer from mental or psychiatric disorder. This represents an average of 88 reported cases of mental illness per 100,000 Filipinos. Also, the number of suicide cases in the country has steadily risen over a period of 20 years from 1992 to 2012,” Hontiveros explained.",0
"SENATOR Ralph Recto on Thursday said his colleagues would cross party lines in finding out whether underspending still plagues budget utilization as it had in the past Aquino administration.The Senate president pro tempore added that senators would grill agencies during the 2018 national budget hearings if they are on track in spending their allocations for the current year.Recto said unreleased appropriations have reached P185.8 billion in 2016, on top of unobligated allotments of P410.8 billion.“Of these amounts, how much was due to the election ban on public works and other expenditures, and how much can be pinned on inefficiency, to transition, to lack of plans?” he added.Officials of the Duterte administration have been quoted as saying that the Aquino administration failed to spend or delayed the spending of an estimated P1 trillion in appropriations, a charge which has been denied by the previous set of economic managers.“Now that the shoe is on the other foot, it is time to ask this question: Have you solved the problem you have accused your predecessors of doing?” Recto said.“It’s a valid question because budget hearings are sessions where they’ll be asking for fund replenishment. So before we replenish, we should ask if they’ve been prompt in disbursing,” he added.Recto said the agencies’ “fund absorptive capacity” would also impact on the Senate debates on the administration’s mixed bag of proposed tax cuts and increases. “We will be looking at both ledgers. Income and spending.”Examining “spending problem areas would not only pinpoint slow-moving programs, but the fat in the budget and in the bureaucracy as well,” he added.",1
"A “welcome gift” of P100 million awaited Nicanor Faeldon when he took over the Bureau of Customs (BOC) at the start of the Duterte administration in July last year, Sen. Panfilo Lacson said on Wednesday.“Loud whispers in the four corners of the BOC compound tell of a P100-million ‘pasalubong’ to the newly installed commissioner, a quarter of which, or P25 million was retained as a finder’s fee by his middleman named Joel Teves,” Lacson said in a privilege speech titled “Kita kita (sa Customs) [I see you at Customs].”Teves was among the 44 alleged bribe givers, or “players,” that Lacson identified at the BOC.Lacson said Faeldon was swallowed by the system after a year in office, as he led officials and employees in receiving payoffs through a “tara” (payola) system that has been in place in the agency for a long time.“Hell is empty and all the devils are at the BOC,” Lacson said, paraphrasing Shakespeare’s “Hell is empty and all the devils are here.”“And for the devils, the BOC is heaven — a heaven that is a haven for crooks, criminals, malefactors and faeldons … sorry, I meant felons,” the senator said.President Rodrigo Duterte announced on Monday that he had accepted the resignation of Faeldon and that he had appointed Isidro Lapeña, head of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, as his replacement.Faeldon called for a third-party investigation into the issues hounding the BOC as he denied Lacson’s allegations that he was among those who received bribe money at the agency.“I have not asked anybody to collect tara for me nor have I accepted any tara from anybody,” Faeldon said in a text message.“The country will appreciate if a third-party investigation by a competent body will be conducted so that justice will be served,” he said.Carefully vetted listAs he had promised, Lacson delivered his privilege speech identifying the alleged bribe givers, collectors/bagmen and the recipients at the BOC based on the tara list he compiled and “carefully vetted and cross-matched.”He said leading the pack was no less than Faeldon and his five deputy commissioners—Teddy Raval of the Intelligence Group, Ariel Nepomuceno of the Enforcement Group, Gerardo Gambala of the Command Center, Natalio Ecarma III of the Revenue Collection Monitoring Group and Edward James Dy Buco of the Assessment and Operations Coordination Group.The senator said a “prominent” BOC official whom he did not name earned P5,109,000 from May 16 to June 28 alone.“The tara system, Mr. President, shows that there is systematic corruption in the bureau. In fact, with almost every office and official receiving their share of tara, the bureau can give the Mafia stiff competition,” Lacson said.Shabu smugglingLacson said the P6.4-billion “shabu” (crystal meth) shipment that passed through the BOC and ended up in a warehouse in Valenzuela City “sounds more like the inspiration behind the hit movie title, ‘Kita Kita (I Can See You).”’He said the shipment was “smuggled under the noses or through the indispensable participation of BOC officials.”“We can see the incomes of several customs officials,” Lacson said, pointing out that during the Senate blue ribbon committee inquiry into the controversy, “fixer” Mark Taguba named BOC officers and bagmen he bribed, but “did not spill all the beans.”Lacson recalled that in one of the hearings, Faeldon said he was aware of the tara system but he could not investigate it because he was only able to form an investigative team six months later.But it was a lie, according to Lacson, saying that Faeldon appointed Gambala and other technical assistants as early as July last year.ImpunityHaving the backing of Mr. Duterte, Faeldon should have started to clean up the agency by eliminating the tara system but he was eaten up by it, “effectively tolerating and even promoting the impunity of corruption.”“How can we stop the importation of illegal drugs at the BOC if the graft activities of its officials and personnel and the corrupt system persist in the seaports and airports?” he said.Lacson said his office was contacted by BOC officials, employees, brokers and even a civic-minded individual who had been gathering information on the tara system at the BOC or how much an office or an official was getting per container. (See table.)“From this, the share of each office or person within the bureau ranges from a low of P200 to a high of P15,000 per container. Believe it or not, officials from the top offices of the bureau down to those who monitor the ‘gates’ and X-ray (machines) have their share in the tara,” Lacson said.He listed the 44 bribe givers and 21 collectors/bagmen.Big players, Davao GroupLacson also listed the standard tara for BOC offices, and for the Manila International Container Port and the Port of Manila.Lacson also identified the “big players” at the BOC who he said were enjoying the quick release of their shipments. (See list.)Lacson said he hoped Lapeña whom he knew would not be eaten up by the system.“His highest calling at the moment is to descend on the gates of hell and destroy the brazen corruption within the country’s most corrupt agency,” he said.During the interpellation, Sen. Cynthia Villar noted that David Tan and Manny Santos, who were on Lacson’s list, were investigated in 2013 by the Senate for rice smuggling and Lea Cruz, for garlic smuggling in 2014.Lacson said Faeldon and other BOC officials could be liable in connection with the smuggling of shabu.“Their eyes have been covered with money and they no longer think whether drugs or contraband are being released,” Lacson told Sen. Bam Aquino who asked questions about the exposé.Sought for comment, Gambala said: “God knows everything that I do; there’s nothing that I can hide from him. That’s why I submit to his will and hold on to his promise that he will never leave me nor forsake me.”",1
"It may have been a long and serious meeting that mixed former leaders with unresolved issues between them, but President Duterte had a not-so-secret weapon up his sleeve to brighten up the room: his comic flair.Known for his casual style and preference for the informal, Mr. Duterte steered the more than five-hour National Security Council meeting on Wednesday with jokes and ad libs, lightening up the atmosphere even as discussions dealt with some of the country’s gravest problems, said Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II.Similar to the playful mien he showed during his first State of the Nation Address on Monday, the President unleashed antics that kept the meeting vibrant even in the presence of former officials who are no longer in speaking terms: former Presidents Benigno Aquino III and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, now a Pampanga representative.Exchanging jokes“It was nice. [Those present] were very friendly. We were laughing. We exchanged jokes. But chiefly, it was President Duterte who made the jokes,” Aguirre told reporters on Thursday.Asked what some of the jokes were, the justice secretary, who was sworn to secrecy about Wednesday night’s proceedings, shared one.Beautiful Vice President“His joke was that our Vice President is beautiful,” said Aguirre, in reference to Vice President Leni Robredo.It had taken a while for Mr. Duterte to meet with Robredo after their respective electoral victories in May. Things warmed up between the two when they first met at the military’s change of command ceremonies on July 1, when a seemingly smitten Mr. Duterte even offered hanky-holding Robredo his coco water.Six days later, Mr. Duterte called Robredo in a nationally broadcast PTV 4 interview and offered her the housing portfolio.No greetingAsked about the dynamics between Aquino and Arroyo, Aguirre said: “They didn’t say anything awkward [to each other]. They just didn’t greet each other.”Footage of the encounter showed the cold relationship between Aquino and Arroyo. The latter was released recently after the Supreme Court dismissed plunder charges filed against her during the former’s term. Throughout his six years in Malacañang, Aquino often attributed the country’s problems to Arroyo.No sitting orderAguirre said there was protocol observed in the way the four leaders were seated from across Mr. Duterte, but it was clear they were not positioned according to their terms in office, as Arroyo was seated two places away from Aquino, with former Presidents Fidel Ramos and Joseph Estrada between them.Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, who was seated to Arroyo’s left, said he “did not notice” the dynamics between Arroyo and Aquino.“The atmosphere was serious, but then the President had his way of lightening the atmosphere,” Pimentel said.Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto, among those invited to the meeting, said Mr. Duterte shifted from serious to comical during the meeting.“He can be focused one moment and funny the next. It is both educational and entertaining. This guy’s thought process is good. He knows when to summarize points and where to shepherd the discussion,” Recto said, complimenting the President.Recto said that as much as Mr. Duterte gave “great inputs,” he was also the source of “in-house entertainment.“To break the monotony of long meetings, [Wednesday’s] was almost five hours long, he has this comedian’s gift of timing on when to crack jokes,” he said.RELATED VIDEO",1
"Typhoon “Nona” left the islands of Mindoro and Romblon in southern Luzon devastated on Tuesday, shutting down power lines, potable water supply and communication facilities, while blocking roads with uprooted trees, eroded soil and other debris, officials said.Nona (international name: Melor), which made a fifth landfall in Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, was the worst typhoon to hit the island in 22 years, according to Oriental Mindoro Gov. Alfonso Umali Jr.By late Tuesday, the typhoon paralyzed large parts of Metro Manila, with floodwaters chest-deep in some areas disrupting train services, causing traffic gridlock on major roads and stranding thousands of commuters.Throughout the night of Tuesday to Wednesday continuous rain poured over Central Luzon provinces, as well as Baguio City and parts of Benguet, helping raise the water elevation of the reservoir of Angat Dam in Bulacan province.President Aquino on Wednesday directed Cabinet officials to ensure giving “immediate relief,” including providing temporary shelters, to those affected the typhoon.Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma said various government agencies were using their quick-response funds in attending to the needs of those affected by Nona.He said the government would prioritize giving shelters to those who lost their homes.Damage to agri, propertyAs of Wednesday, the operations center of the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) said that around 1.2 million people had been affected by the typhoon in Oriental Mindoro, Romblon, Marinduque, Palawan provinces, Samar Island and the Bicol region.The PRC said more than 156,000 houses had been damaged, forcing more than 10,700 people to stay in 70 evacuation centers.Initial damage to agriculture reached P154 million, while the value of infrastructure destroyed or damaged was placed at P51 million, according to the Office of Civil Defense (OCD).FatalitiesEleven people have so far been reported killed and hundreds spent the night huddled under roofs, as floods generated by Nona inundated villages. Five people were listed as missing.But the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said six were confirmed killed.Health Secretary Janette Garin identified two of the fatalities as Aucente Pascual Jr., 31, from Allen, Northern Samar province, who sustained head trauma when he was hit by flying debris; and Jason Desario, 28, from Matuguinao, Western Samar, who drowned.Garin said there were two reported deaths “indirectly related” to Nona: One lost consciousness while on the way to an evacuation center, and another drowned before the onset of the typhoon.All other casualty reports are still being verified, the Department of Health said.In Mindoro and Romblon, at least six persons were reported killed while hundreds were evacuated and moved away from swollen rivers, flooded streets and storm surges that destroyed coastal houses.Five people were reported killed in Northern Samar.The typhoon made its first landfall in Batag, Northern Samar on Monday morning; made a second landfall past 3 p.m. in Bulusan, Sorsogon; and proceeded to Burias Island in Masbate for a third landfall late Monday, before hitting land for the fourth time in Bantog, Romblon early on Tuesday.Umali said initial reports indicated huge damage to property and infrastructure in the whole Oriental Mindoro, which suffered two fatalities.Reports likewise indicated widespread devastation in Rom-blon, with at least three persons killed at the height of the typhoon’s onslaught in the province.This developed as the province of Sorsogon, where Nona made its second landfall, continued to reel from the effects of the typhoon.Four-meter storm surgeA storm surge on the shore of the coastal village of Mabuhay rose to four meters or as high as a two-story building, said Senior Insp. Alex Sumayao, Bulusan’s police chief.He said the people in Barangay Mabuhay had moved out in the nick of time because at 5 p.m. the storm surge was already crushing their houses, with about 259 of them immediately destroyed or swept away to the sea.Allan Escueta, 58, a Balud del Norte resident, said the waves breached the three-meter high seawall at about 3 p.m. Monday and by 5 p.m. the waves became bigger and rolled over above the seawall and destroyed houses.A 70-year-old grandmother and her 11-year-old granddaughter were killed when a tree fell down and crushed them in their house in Boton, Casiguran, Sorsogon.Near the boundary of Barcelona and Bulusan, the typhoon skinned a school building of its corrugated iron roofs.Edita Estuye, principal of Celso F. Falcotelo National High School, in Barangay Macabari, Barcelona, said the destroyed two-room building was newly constructed and hosted third-year classes.Estuye showed damaged portions of the school—a building that she said was also newly constructed. “The kind of work maybe sub-standard,” she said.Blocked roadsUmali said his office still had to verify the extent of the damage, as well as confirm the casualty report, but Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council personnel and other rescuers were having difficulty reaching devastated areas because of felled trees and toppled electric posts that blocked roads.Landline communication was out while there was hardly any signal from wireless telecommunication service providers.Occidental MindoroIn Occidental Mindoro, the typhoon hit the town of Sta. Cruz at 3 p.m. Tuesday, also shutting down both power and communication facilities in its wake.The Sta. Cruz municipal disaster risk reduction management officer, Augusto Viray, reached late Tuesday night, said about a thousand persons had evacuated to the town hall and the adjoining motor pool.In Abra de Ilog town, also in Occidental Mindoro, local authorities also reported widespread damage with displaced families now housed at the town’s gymnasium.READ: Oriental Mindoro under state of calamityRomblonIn Romblon province, three people were listed killed while one went missing at the height of Nona.But even as the weather improved on Wednesday, reports of the typhoon damage from other parts of the province have yet to come in with the island-towns of Banton, Corcuera, and Sibale remained cut off from the pro-vince’s capital—Romblon, Rom-blon—due to damaged communication lines.Initial reports in the province recorded three fatalities: a female victim died when hit by a toppled tree; another woman who died in a road accident due to “zero visibility;” and a man who was hitby an iron sheet from a blown-off roof of a house on Banton island. A woman was reported missing in Cajidiocan town.The OCD in Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan) reported that least 21,498 persons in the region were evacuated to shelters at the height of the typhoon on Tuesday.Floods were also reported in Abra de Ilog in Occidental Mindoro and the towns of Socorro, Baco, San Teodoro, Naujan and Calapan City in Oriental Mindoro.Some sections of the national roads in the towns of Socorro, Calapan City and San Teodoro in Oriental Mindoro still remained unpassable to vehicles due to floods and scattered fallen trees.Classes in all school levels were still suspended throughout the region.At least 2,328 remained stranded in ports in the region.Most roads and bridges on Mindoro Island were passable by Wednesday afternoon, but power remained out in both Oriental and Occidental Mindoro provinces, said Supt. Imelda Tolentino, information officer of the Mimaropa police.In Marinduque, only parts of Boac, the capital town, and its adjoining town of Mogpog have electricity, she said.In Romblon, power remained down as of late Wednesday, with at least 1,5018 persons still in evacuation centers.The entire province of Northern Samar was placed under a state of calamity on Tuesday.There was no data on the damage sustained by Northern Samar due to Nona, considered to be the most destructive typhoon to hit the province in years. Data gathering was difficult because power and communication lines were down in the entire province.In Legazpi City, Bishop Joel Baylon urged Albayanos to help typhoon victims as an act of thanksgiving after the province was spared from the wrath of the typhoon.

"Photos of a young girl who got beaten by her senior high school boyfriend went viral on the internet on Friday.Netizen Anthony Hitomo, lambasted the boyfriend of his sister on social media, identified as Andrei Allareyand, a student of Sampaguita National High School in San Pedro Laguna.According to Hitomo’s post, the victim experienced trauma when her boyfriend beat him for still not known reasons.Hitomo also claimed that his sister repeatedly told him that the suspect threatened to kill her.The brother of the victim also claimed that the suspect already beat his sister for the third time and he believes that the Allarey is consuming illegal drugs that made him to commit such crime.He also posted some of the photos of his sister and showed the bruises that the victim received from the suspect.The photos posted by Hitomo showed that the victim had bruises in different parts of her body including her head, left side of stomach, legs and back.Hitomo said that he’s willing to file a case against Allarey and face the consequences for hurting his sister.If proven, Allarey Andrei might face charges for violating the Republic Act 9262 also known as “The Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children Act of 2004”But if the suspect was still a minor, the ‘Pangilinan Act’ would save him from being jailed and he might be transferred in the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development.As of writing, the post of Hitomo already received 9,000 reactions and thousands of shares from the netizens,",0
"Health personnel have cleared a patient here of possible infection from the Zika virus after earlier showing its supposed symptoms.Dr. Mely Lastimoso, chief of the City Health Office’s (CHO) epidemiology and surveillance unit, said Tuesday the suspected Zika patient came out negative of the disease based on the tests and assessment that they conducted.“Up to this time, we have no case (of Zika infection) here in GenSan,” she said in an interview over Brigada News TV.Lastimoso said the patient was earlier “endorsed (to the CHO) for Zika virus” after reportedly exhibiting symptoms related to the disease.The CHO did not identify or disclose any other information regarding the cleared patient.But she said they based their assessment on the case definition of Zika infection based on a national advisory issued by the Department of Health.She said the disease’s symptoms include fever, skin rashes, body and head aches, redness of the eyes and vomiting.Patients are also assessed based on travel history to areas with confirmed cases and those considered endemic to the Zika virus.“The patient did not fall on these two indicators so we ruled out the Zika infection,” Lastimoso said.With this, she said there is no cause for alarm in the city regarding the disease but at the same time urged residents to take the necessary precaution.She said it is important for residents to regularly clean up their households and surroundings of possible breeding places of the Zika-carrying mosquitoes.Like the deadly dengue fever and other diseases, Zika is carried and transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.“Since the rainy season is here, the Aedes mosquitoes also thrive in households as they are domesticated,” Lastimoso said.She advised residents who would exhibit symptoms of the disease to seek immediate treatment.They should also maintain healthy lifestyle and eat nutritious food to ensure that their immune systems remain high, she said.“Viruses are self-limiting and they will just shun from your body if your immune system is high,” she added.",1
"Imee and Bongbong Marcos turned 18 in 1973 and 1975, respectively, old enough to have witnessed the atrocities committed during the “conjugal dictatorship” of their parents, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said in response to President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent remarks.Mr. Duterte on Friday suggested that the two Marcos heirs were too young to have been complicit in the human rights violations documented during the Marcos regime.“What wrong did they do? Why won’t I go there, shake hands? What did Imee do wrong? All of them were young, the only adults there were Imelda and Ferdinand,” Mr. Duterte said in an interview by the government TV station.But Lagman took note of the ages of former Sen. Bongbong Marcos and his sister, Ilocos Sur Gov. Imee Marcos, and said that the President could not absolve them as sinless “because they have been for a long time and until now culpable beneficiaries of the ill-gotten hoard of their father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.”He added: “Although they were teenagers when martial law was declared in September 1972, they attained the age of majority shortly after … and were already adults during the height of the martial law regime.”The House opposition leader said that “Imee and Bongbong celebrated their 18th birthdays in 1973 and 1975, respectively, and were old enough when the documented atrocities and plunder were committed by the conjugal dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos.”Ferdinand Marcos became President in 1965. His eldest, Imee, was born in 1955, while namesake Bongbong was born in 1957.Trajano murderLagman also recalled Imee’s alleged involvement in the murder of student Archimedes Trajano in 1977.“When Imee Marcos headed the Kabataang Barangay after she was handpicked by then President Marcos, she was accused of the murder of Archimedes Trajano who was reportedly killed by her security escorts and found dead two days after an open forum, where Trajano challenged (her) credentials,” the Albay representative said.On Aug. 31, 1977, the student from Mapua Institute of Technology had asked about Imee Marcos’ qualifications to lead the national youth group during a forum at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, Lagman said.In 1991, the Hawaii District Court awarded $4.16 million to the Trajano family, a ruling affirmed by the US Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit Court in 1992, the opposition congressman said.“(But) the effort of the Trajano family to enforce in the Philippines the foreign judgment was quashed by the Philippine Supreme Court on the technicality of a defective substituted service of summons to Imee Marcos who claimed that she was then a resident of Singapore when the summons was served at Alexandra Homes in Pasig City, her reported address,” the Albay representative added.",1
"The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) warns that continuing delays in the P11.2-billion mega dam project in Calinog, Iloilo province may put other projects at risk.NIA Administrator Peter Laviña disclosed that the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Eximbank) may no longer be interested in funding other projects in the country because of the status of the Jalaur River Multipurpose Project-Stage II (JRMP-II).Eximbank loaned more than P9 billion for JRMP-II, but construction for it has yet to start.The project hit another snag last December when Korean contractor Daewoo filed a case against the NIA’s Bids and Awards Committee.The court ordered NIA to stop bidding procedures and re-evaluate Daewoo’s bid.Laviña said NIA was trying to get Dawoo to drop the case for bidding to resume.Laviña assured Iloilo Governor Arthur Defensor Sr. and the indigenous people (IP) that the Duterte administration backs the JRMP-II project.The mega-dam was a priority project of former president Benigno S.

"Divorce is possible in the Philippines, after all.In a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court has upheld the divorce of a Muslim man and a Roman Catholic woman over “irreconcilable religious differences,” affirming the practice called talaq, or divorce, under the Code of Muslim Personal Laws of the Philippines, which is based on the Sharia, or Islamic law.The decision, written by Associate Justice Jose Mendoza and concurred in by the entire court, “maintained” the divorce of John Maliga and Sheryl Mendez, which was granted by the Cotabato City 1st Sharia Circuit Court (ShCC) on Aug. 19, 2011, on Maliga’s request because of conflict in religious views and practices.The Supreme Court also upheld the ShCC order for Maliga to give Mendez P24,000 as a “consolatory gift” or mut’a, also a practice under the Muslim Code.The high court then remanded to the ShCC proceedings for the custody of the now divorced couple’s daughter, saying the mother had been deprived of due process.Maliga and Mendez were married in Muslim rites in April 2008, with Mendez agreeing to convert to Islam.Presidential Decree No. 1083, or the Code of Muslim Personal Laws of the Philippines, allows divorce as “the formal dissolution of the marriage bond … to be granted only after the exhaustion of all possible means of reconciliation between the spouses.”Reasons for divorceThe Muslim Code allows different forms of cutting marital ties, including situations where the man may seek “perpetual divorce” from his wife when the wife commits adultery (divorce by li’an), or if a wife seeks release from marriage when the husband commits “unusual cruelty,” suffers from insanity or affliction of incurable disease, or neglects family support for six consecutive months, among other conditions (divorce by faskh).In the case of Maliga and Mendez, Maliga sought a divorce by talaq, a separation that “may be effected by the husband in a single repudiation of his wife” after totally abstaining from sexual relations with her.Muslim marriage in the Philippines falls under the Muslim Code and not the Family Code, which does not recognize divorce.Marriage in the Philippines may be nullified under the law in a process that voids the union from the beginning, as if husband and wife were never married. A divorce terminates the marriage but recognizes the years the couple were together.Many marital separations in the country invoke Article 36 of the Family Code, where one party alleges that the other is “psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential obligations of marriage” as a ground to dissolve a union.Proving such incapacity against the other party would void the marriage.Void from the beginningMarriage may also be declared void from the beginning due to technical and legal flaws, including if one party is below legal age, or if the couple married without a license, or if the marriage is bigamous or polygamous.The Family Code also provides for legal separation in case one party commits domestic abuse, addiction to vices, sexual infidelity and criminal conviction among other grounds. But this process does not terminate a marriage and parties are not allowed to remarry.There have been several attempts to legalize divorce in the Philippines, but none has prospered.Maliga married Mendez in April 2008 under Muslim law, when they already had a child.At the time, Maliga already had “several wives” and three children, according to court records.Mendez agreed to convert to Islam. But their relationship turned “sour” shortly after, according to the court, with Maliga seeking a divorce because Mendez reverted to Christianity just eight months after their marriage.Maliga also filed for custody of their daughter.No changesThe court said Maliga “claimed he started to doubt the sincerity of his wife’s submission to Islam, having noticed no changes in her moral attitude and social lifestyle despite his guidance.”He sought custody of his daughter after learning that Mendez, who returned to Manila just months after their wedding, had enrolled the child in a Catholic school.The court said Maliga felt her daughter was placed in an environment where she faced “religious growth and values repugnant to Islam.”In granting Maliga’s repudiation of his wife, the ShCC also granted his urgent motion to take custody of his daughter “because of social, financial and religious standing.”The local court also noted that he had “raised a good Muslim daughter as evidenced by her appearance,” and said the couple were married in Muslim rites in the first place.The differences came to a point that Mendez filed a kidnapping complaint against her estranged husband in the National Bureau of Investigation.The ShCC ruling, which was later upheld by the Sharia District Court (ShDC), did not sit well with the Supreme Court. It ruled that the ShCC deprived Mendez of due process and did not even give her a notice of hearing.The court said the ShCC was “remiss in its duty to state the precise factual and legal basis on which its ruling awarding custody to Maliga was based.”“The award of custody to Maliga by the ShCC was void, as it was rendered in violation of the constitutional right of Mendez to due process,” the court said in the ruling dated Jan. 12 but released just this week.“Not only was the award of custody violative of the constitutional right of Mendez to due process, but also both the orders of the ShCC and the ShDC awarding custody of (the daughter) to Maliga were without evidentiary basis because no hearing was actually conducted. There was no explanation given as to why the motion was resolved without notice,” the court said.",1
"Improve airport services first.Sen. Grace Poe called out the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) after it bared plans to increase the terminal fee or passenger service charge at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) by April next year.“Before focusing on the ‘charge’ part, maybe it is best for MIAA and Naia to first focus on passenger service,” said Poe, who chairs the Senate’s public services committee.The MIAA said it planned to increase terminal fees for international flights from P550 to P750, and for domestic flights from P200 to P300.Stranded passengersIn a statement, Poe asked the MIAA to show first that it was using the fees properly.She also rebuked the MIAA for its response to the plight of passengers stranded at Naia in August after a Xiamen Air plane skidded off the runway and got stuck in a muddy field, forcing authorities to halt flight operations.Poe said Naia’s sound system had not worked well at the time, causing passengers to miss the announcement of their boarding time and gates, and subsequently miss their flights.“What [is MIAA] doing right now with the existing ‘passenger service charge’ or terminal fee? What are they going to do if ever it increases? We can’t simply [accept their plan] hook, line and sinker. How about the kind of service that passengers deserve?” Poe asked.",1
"President Aquino himself on Thursday dashed hopes Vice President Jejomar Binay might have seeking his endorsement as the administration’s presidential candidate in next year’s election.Speaking to reporters, Aquino said the support he could give Binay was to ensure credible and orderly elections.READ: Aquino says endorsing Binay unlikely“That is the minimum I could give to any candidate. Perhaps that is my last major task,” the President said.Binay told a news conference on Wednesday that he was hoping President Aquino would consider endorsing his presidential candidacy.He said he was hoping for a come-from-behind support from the President, like Sen. Francis “Chiz” Escudero’s homestretch swing to his side in 2010 that gave him the vice-presidential election.READ: Aquino says he’ll meet with Escudero nextSenate President Franklin Drilon, an LP stalwart, on Thursday said the President’s endorsement was reserved for a party member.Speaking in a radio interview, Drilon said Aquino “would not endorse a candidate who is not from the Liberal Party (LP).”LP members snorted at Binay’s expectations, with Caloocan Rep. Edgar Erice saying the President was not thinking of endorsing the Vice President, “not even in his dreams.”Unclear about ‘support’In Iloilo City on Thursday, Aquino said it was unclear to him whether Binay was seeking his support for the Vice President’s presidential bid in 2016.The President said it would be “presumptuous” for him to say that Binay was seeking his support because the Vice President allied himself with a different party and other groups in the 2010 and 2013 elections.“Then come 2016, we will be together? It’s like, it turns out he is coming to us but he took a long detour to get to us,” Aquino said.Binay is a longtime friend of the Aquino family. His political career began when then President Corazon Aquino, mother of the current President, appointed him officer in charge of Makati City after the Edsa People Power Revolution in 1986.Binay and his family have ruled the city since. He is now embroiled in corruption allegations, with former allies accusing him in the Senate of amassing ill-gotten wealth during his term as mayor of the city.‘Consultations’At the news conference at the Iloilo provincial capitol, the President was flanked by Drilon and Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, the LP’s presumptive presidential candidate.Aquino gave no indication that he had already chosen a presidential candidate for 2016.He said he would finish his “consultations” before announcing his chosen candidate.Aquino has said he will announce his choice after he addresses a joint session of Congress for the last time on July 27.Vague about PoeThe President, however, was vague about his meeting on Wednesday with Sen. Grace Poe, who topped the 2013 senatorial election and has emerged as a potential presidential candidate next year.It is believed that the LP is wooing Poe to be Roxas’ vice-presidential running mate.President Aquino said that at their meeting, Poe appeared to be interviewing him, particularly on the administration’s poverty alleviation projects, such as the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program.He said he told Poe that it would take time for programs like the CCT to bear fruit.“We had some clarity about perspective … the viewpoints on governance, she agrees. She said we should see eye to eye on what should happen, which is the continuance of the current governance,” Aquino said.The President said he and Poe discussed “many more details, but it’s still a work in progress.”Speaking to reporters in Makati City on Thursday, Poe said the President did not offer her anything during their meeting in Malacañang on Wednesday afternoon.Poe refused to disclose her plans for 2016, but said she and Escudero “were talking about possibilities.”Like being in conventShe said she had “a lot of things to consider” before deciding to run.“I know that people are saying, ‘You’re just playing hard to get.’ [But] this is not an easy decision to make,” she said.“I don’t have the machinery, I don’t have the money. [W]hat I have is a dream and the thought that it is indeed a privilege to have something to do, to be part of making our country better,” she said.Poe said the presidency is a privilege, not something that could be easily desired.“It is a huge challenge.

"First of two partsBeijing is only holding off its plans to build over the disputed Scarborough Shoal in order to squeeze out everything from the Duterte administration and move to the “next step,” according to a maritime expert.Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative and Southeast Asia program fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, made the statement on Friday as he pointed out that China has been building structures over disputed waters in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea).Poling backed a statement made by Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana last year that he was expecting China to eventually build “something” over Scarborough Shoal.“It’s a matter of when, not if, and it’s a matter of what they built. So maybe, they don’t build another giant island [which] was easy to start in late 2013 when nobody was watching,” he said in an interview at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City.“I promise that everybody won’t be publishing photos of Chinese [dredgers] tomorrow if [it] started today, so maybe, it’s a small facility,” Poling added.His statements came days after the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) patrolled Scarborough Shoal where it monitored more Chinese vessels including fishing and Coast Guard ships surrounding the territory.For him, there was also a “political decision” that China feels that it is winning the dispute with other claimants to the waters 124 nautical miles off Masinloc, Zambales.“If China feels right now that it is winning, why provoke crisis with the Duterte administration? You know, day by day the Chinese are allowed to strengthen their military control over the South China Sea and the Philippines does nothing in response,” Poling explained.‘Next phase’He said Manila might be “forced” to take action once Beijing spoiled its authority over the territorial waters.“If they overplay their hand at Scarborough Shoal, Malacañang might be forced to respond and I think they will hold off to build in Scarborough Shoal until they [China] feel like they have extracted as much as they can from the Duterte government,” Poling added.“Then, they will move on to the next phase,” he said.The maritime expert visited the Philippines as part of the US State Department-sponsored multi-country speaker program that includes two days in the country.Another point Poling raised is that the claimant nations must take the first necessary steps to come up with a “clear-eyed” policy recognizing the worthiness of pursuing the Code of Conduct (CoC) drafted during last year’s Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit, which was hosted by the Philippines.In August 2017, China and Southeast Asian foreign ministers adopted a negotiating framework for a Code of Conduct in the disputed South China Sea that was hailed by the Asean foreign affairs leaders.President Rodrigo Duterte mentioned during the Asean Leaders’ Summit last year that China “graciously agreed” to bind itself to the drafted agreement by the foreign ministers.But for Poling, it was obvious that China was not willing to bind itself to the code, citing the establishment of several man-made islands in the disputed waters.“The evidence of the last 18 months or so does not support the idea that China is willing to negotiate the binding of the Code of Conduct that brought all parties,” he said.“This is not to say that the [CoC] talks are a waste of time, that we should not be reaching out to China automatically, simply, we should be doing this with open eyes and recognize that the Chinese built thousands of square meters of military facilities over the course of 2017,” Poling added.‘Coercive tactic’While Asean countries, particularly the claimants to the South China Sea territories were discussing the code, China had already built bunkers, missile shelters and radar facilities that can be described as a “coercive tactic,” according to him.“If you haven’t put the footage in there yet, it’s like waving around an empty gun and it’s inherently threatening at the same time,” he said.Structures on the man-made islands in South China Sea sum up China’s approach as “military in nature,” Poling added.He said over the “rainy days,” China will be basing its fighter jets on a runway built over the waters.“You’re going to see more signals of intelligence and things like that. You’re gonna keep on seeing the increase in number of Chinese coast guards and maritime naval ships making calls to these,” according to Poling.“Little by little, the Chinese plan seems to establish [a] de facto control, maybe without provoking an immediate sharp clash but by sheer force of number that eventually is going to be there such as coast guards and navy ships,” he added.Poling said every claimant nations should be “realistic” with their expectations from the Asean Summit in Manila that China would bind itself to the Code of Conduct drafted earlier last year.“Asean is not a mutual security alliance. It’s not equipped to handle something like this [because] Asean is about confidence-building and socializing China into habits of cooperation,” he explained.“There is a whole lot of options between surrender and war that are not being tried and the idea that in theory, a future war would be winnable but nobody wants to go to war [over] the South China Sea. But does that [not] mean that we cannot talk about other stuff in the middle?” Poling added.(To be continued)",1

It becomes a trial by publicity,” Abella told reporters.The Palace official said the photos must first be vetted for accuracy in order to count them as documentary evidence.“I mean what does a picture prove? [It’s] different when [it is shown] in the court and different when there is really documentary evidence,” Abella added.“Yun ang sinasabi, ang mahalaga, documentary evidence, hindi lang sabi-sabi [That’s what’s important, documentary evidence, not hearsay]… Otherwise, all of these things are just speculations, propaganda that can be used and misused,” he said.Abella reiterated President Duterte’s promise to step down from office if anyone can give him an affidavit proving his son is corrupt.“Well the President said, kung pamilya niya ang madadawit, siya mismo ang bababa [if his family was really into it, he himself will step down as President],” he said.Customs broker Mark Taguba earlier dropped several names of government officials who were on the take from smugglers during a congressional hearing on August 6.One of the names that cropped up was that of Duterte’s son, Paolo, who immediately denied the accusations.On Friday, President Duterte promised to resign if the corruption allegation against his son was proven.“If my son was really into it or is in there, all you have to do is to produce the paper because there are two ways of evidence, oral and documentary,” the President said in his speech in Davao City.“Just give me an affidavit and I will step down as President of this Republic, and that is my commitment to you now. That is my word,” he added.Aside from Paolo, four senators were also linked to Dong, the middleman who who dealt with Taguba in the shabu shipment from China.Dong was a campaign donor of Sen. Joel Villanueva in the 2016 elections while Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto as well as senators Risa Hontiveros, Juan Miguel Zubiri and Francis Pangilinan were his wedding sponsors in 2013.In separate statements, Zubiri, Hontiveros, Pangilinan and Villanueva confirmed reports that they had connections with Dong.But all denied knowing his involvement in illegal drugs.",1

"Every time Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao fights in the ring, it goes without saying that Filipinos will get to see him and his opponent. Live. On TV. In the Philippines.It has been said that each time there is a Pacquiao match, the Philippines comes to a standstill. Traffic becomes unbelievably light, crime rate drops to zero, everyone is glued to television sets, and even the anti-government rebels declare an unofficial ceasefire.Well, that’s not going to happen when Pacquiao faces Timothy Bradley on April 9 in Las Vegas, Nevada — his third match with the American welterweight champion.It has to do with politics and Philippine law.You see, Pacquiao, an incumbent congressman, is running for a Senate seat in the May 9, 2016 Philippine elections. By law, candidates running for office must get equal time on television, which means that if shown on TV in the Philippines, the Pacquiao-Bradley fight will put all other Philippine Senate candidates at a disadvantage in terms of television exposure.A commissioner of the Philippine Commission on Elections has already warned Pacquiao that if his fight is shown on TV in the Philippines, he will have to face serious consequences.Rowena Guanzon said that Pacquiao will have to refrain from the boxing ring during his campaign for a Senate seat in the coming May 9 elections.So, instead of dropping from the senatorial race, Pacquiao agreed that his fight will not be shown on Philippine television at all.Pacquiao fans, however, are urging him to drop his senatorial bid instead so that they can watch his match with Bradley, live on TV, on April 9.",0
"FORMER Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda on Monday said the Philippines, where the Fukuda Doctrine was born, is an “important country” for Japan.He made the remark during the unveiling of the Fukuda Doctrine memorial plaque at the Manila Hotel.Fukuda’s father, the late former Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, announced the doctrine on August 18, 1977 at the Manila Hotel to conclude his visit to Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries, including the Philippines.The Fukuda Doctrine became the cornerstone of Japan’s Asean diplomacy. The memorial plaque was installed to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the doctrine, which articulated three guiding principles — Japan will never become a military power; Japan will build ‘heart-to-heart’ relations with Asean countries; and Japan and Asean are equal partners.“The Philippines where the Fukuda Doctrine was born, is a major Asean country with a population of over 100 million people. It is an important country for Japan,” Yasuo said.“Dr. Jose Rizal, the Filipino hero, who visited Japan 130 years ago, in 1888, predicted the future of our countries as, ‘Japan and the Philippines will develop close ties in the future,” he said.The unveiling of the plaque was witnessed by Takeo’s children and grandchildren; former ambassador Sakutaro Tanino, who took part in drafting the Fukuda Doctrine; former Minister of Justice Seiken Suguira; Keiko Atsumi, from the InterAction Center which Takeo created; and Kiyoaki Aburaki of the Japan Federation of Economic Associations, among others.“All of us thought fondly of the events of over 40 years ago, on Aug. 18, 1977, when Takeo Fukuda announced the Fukuda Doctrine at this hotel,” Yasuo said.",1
"THE Department of Education (DepEd) under the watch of Secretary Leonor Briones on Monday said it is committed to improving the country’s basic education system, as it promised an active, transparent, consultative, collaborative and corruption-free leadership.The Education department is also committed to responding to reasonable economic demands of teachers and non-teaching personnel, Briones added.“We will also continue existing cooperation with the private sector and communities, as well as with bilateral and multilateral institutions toward the fulfillment of our vision and agenda,” she said in her keynote speech during the recently held education summit at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City (Metro Manila).According to the DepEd chief, she will expand Adopt-A-School project and other partnerships.“Thus, we will continue the efforts to get our school-age children to school, and to keep them in school up to completion of basic education. But for those who are not reached by the formal basic education system, the Department of Education under my term is determined to intensify and expand our Alternative Learning Systems [ALS] for out-of-school children, youth and adults whom we are unable to reintegrate to formal education,” Briones said.“We will do this through better targeting of beneficiaries, broader coverage and prioritization of these programs by implementing units, partnerships and modalities that fit the circumstances of target learners,” she added.Briones said the ALS program will be one of the major legacies of the Duterte administration.The Education department, under orders from President Rodrigo Duterte, has strengthened and enriched further curricular reforms in connection with the government’s war on illegal drugs, promotion of reproductive health and mitigation of disasters, Briones said.“Specifically, we are strengthening the drug education component in Science and Health by providing real-life lessons via alternative learning methods, starting in Grade 4,” she added.“We are strengthening gender and development component of school curricula especially in relation to sex education and teenage pregnancy. We are giving emphasis to environmental awareness, disaster preparedness and climate-change adaptation and mitigation,” the DepEd chief said.Briones promised to continue implementation of the K-to-12 [Kindergarten to Grade 12] basic education curriculum.“I have committed to pursue the full implementation of K-to-12. The program is not about simply adding school years to basic education to be at par with international norm but more about the content and the intended outcomes in terms of upgrading education quality,” she said.“The program involves the overhaul of our basic education curriculum to make every learner ready for higher education or for work anywhere, equipped with 21st century skills comprising learning and innovation skills; information, media and technology skills; effective communications skills; and life and career skills,” the DepEd chief added.Of the 25 million students in basic education, 21 million are in public schools, Briones said.“You can imagine the massive education inputs that we need to deliver on account of overhauling the curriculum and adding to the years of schooling, in terms of constructing new classrooms, hiring and training of teachers and providing textbooks, learning materials, laboratories and computer packages,” she added.Briones noted that the Duterte administration has allotted a bigger budget for the Education department for the next school year.“The administration has given its immediate response by proposing an unprecedented 31 percent increase in the DepEd budget for 2017, from P433.5 billion to P569 billion,” she said, adding that the proposed appropriation is now closer to the 4 to 6 of Gross Domestic Product ideal appropriation indicated by international standards.“This belies any notion that this government is by any measure abandoning public basic education in favor of privatization,” Briones, a former national treasurer, said.The DepEd chief noted that there was a drastic improvement in the department’s absorptive capacity.“As of June 30, 2016, of the P30.3 billion adjusted allotment, P17.6 billion remained unobligated. For the 2016 appropriations, of the P79.3 billion allotment for MOOE [maintenance and other operating expenses] and capital outlay, P63.9 billion remained unobligated,” she said.Breaking freeBriones added that she is committed to put in place financial management reforms to ensure availability and timely delivery of infrastructure and learning resources both for formal and non-formal education.“We are introducing greater leadership supervision and oversight over finance, administration and procurement. We are setting up an education program monitoring and delivery unit to monitor budget execution and coordinate timely interventions when bottlenecks arise,” she said.“We will develop and establish a financial management information system able to track the status of the department’s budget releases real time. We are now in the thick of planning our 2017 activities with the objectives of breaking free from the ‘catch up’ of budget execution that has so far characterized the department’s performance budget,” Briones added.She said she is open to experimenting with new ideas and pathways to innovation in teaching delivery and content that can maximize the full potential learners, noting that a liberating education should not overlook the development of soft skills.“Not all students can be doctors, scientists, engineers or lawyers. We need to find ways to understand the disposition and interests of our learners, including being artistically inclined, or wanting to take up sports, and be able to offer avenues and teaching support to make those interests flourish,” Briones added.“In the current context of work that requires problem solving, working with people and communities, working in teams and working in different cultural settings, we need teachers who are able to teach and train our learners to effectively communicate, collaborate and adapt,” the DepEd chief explained.Briones said she is seeking to strengthen ties with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Tesda) to fully address problems of deteriorating quality education in the country.“To be frank, we have had limited interaction with our attached agencies in the few months that we have been in office. Let this summit start to change that, and find among us greater mutual relevance and reason for common work,” she added.“I will conclude by emphasizing the need for us in the education sector, especially the three lead agencies of DepEd, CHED and Tesda to coordinate better. It is abundantly clear that we face common challenges in society, economy and environment. None of us can meet these challenges alone,” the DepEd chief added.“Be it in providing pre-service and in-service education and training of our teachers, undertaking research and development, linking with the national and global economy, forging stronger ties with industry or working for common qualifications standards, and all these require us to work together and in a coherent manner,” Briones said.This year’s summit aims to define the medium and long-term education vision and agenda for the trifocal education system—basic education, technical-vocational education and tertiary education.The summit also tackled other issues such as linkage of education and the economy; human resource and management issues in education; understanding the condition and needs of learners to guide intervention; digital education and use of technology in the knowledge and information age; higher education as a force of social and cultural transformation; and higher education as accelerator of innovation and inclusive economic prosperity.",1

"President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday said the Philippines would have its third major telecommunications player in December, as he vowed to select the offer of the bidder with the “best track record.”Duterte made the statement as he expressed frustration over the delays in the government’s selection of the country’s third major telecommunications player.“Late, early November, pag wala pa (if there’s no decision yet), I’ll take over. Ilagay ko iyan sa Office of the President. And I will invite all the businessmen and I will decide in front of them kung sino (who it will be),” Duterte said during a televised interview with Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo.“I will resolve it by late October or early November. By Christmas, alam na ng mga tao kung sino na ang (the people will know the) third player,” he added.Last month, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) said it aims to finish the selection process before the end of the year.This was after missing its initial target of making an announcement before Duterte’s State of the Nation Address in July as the terms of reference for the selection process has yet to be finalized.Duterte, who said he would place the selection process under the Office of the President if he was forced to take, elaborated on how he would make the decision on the third telco player.“Give me your position papers. I’ll read it, give me about 30 minutes then I’ll come back and tell them. I will decide. ‘Yun na at ibigay na ‘yung linya (That’s it and the line will be given),” he said.Duterte earlier called for the entry of a new telco player in a bid to improve the service being provided by current players.PLDT and Globe Telecom continue to dominate the industry after San Miguel Corp sold its telecommunications assets to the two firms in May 2016.The third player must secure a congressional franchise and be able to spend at least P500 billion over five years, said Eliseo Rio, DICT officer-in-charge.",1
"elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will seek to end the country’s massive fuel imports, nearly all from the United States, during the first three years of his term while also boosting refining at home.The landslide winner of last Sunday’s election told reporters on Saturday morning before attending private meetings with members of his future cabinet that he will also prioritize growing crude oil production domestically, which has fallen sharply for years.“The objective is that we stop buying foreign gasoline by the half way point of my six-year term,” said Lopez Obrador, repeating a position he and his senior energy advisor staked out during the campaign.“We are going to immediately revive our oil activity, exploration and the drilling of wells so we have crude oil,” he said.On the campaign trail, the leftist former mayor of Mexico City pitched his plan to wean the country off foreign gasoline as a means to increasing domestic production of crude and value-added fuels, not as a trade issue with the United States.Lopez Obrador also reiterated on Saturday his goal to build either one large or two medium-sized oil refineries during his term, which begins on December 1.While he said the facilities will be built in the Gulf coast states of Tabasco and possibly Campeche, he has been less clear on how the multi-billion-dollar refineries would be funded.So far this year, Mexico has imported an average of about 590,000 barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline and another 232,000 bpd of diesel, as output at the country’s domestic refineries has steadily declined.Foreign gasoline imports have grown by nearly two-thirds, while diesel imports have more than doubled since 2013, the first year of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto’s term, according to data from national oil company Pemex.Meanwhile, the six oil refineries in Mexico owned and operated by Pemex are producing at far below their capacity, or an average of 220,000 bpd of gasoline so far this year.Gasoline production at the facilities is down 50 percent compared to 2013, and domestic gasoline output only accounts for slightly more than a quarter of national demand from the country’s legions of motorists.During the campaign, the two-time presidential runner-up also promised to strengthen Pemex. He also was sharply critical of a 2013 constitutional energy overhaul that ended the company’s monopoly and allowed international oil majors to operate fields on their own for the first time in decades.The overhaul was designed to reverse a 14-year-long oil output slide and has already resulted in competitive auctions that have awarded more than 100 exploration and production contracts to the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil.“What’s most important is to resolve the problem of falling crude oil production. We’re extracting very little oil,” said Lopez Obrador.During the first five months of this year, Mexican crude oil production averaged about 1.9 million bpd, a dramatic drop compared to peak output of nearly 3.4 million bpd in 2004, or 2.5 million bpd in 2013.",1

"THE country’s biggest labor group will strongly oppose any move by the Social Security System (SSS) to increase the monthly contribution of its 14 million members from the private sector amid inflation induced by a new tax reform law that further reduced workers’ take-home pay.Alan Tanjusay, spokesman for the Associated Labor Union-Trade Congress of the Philippines, on Friday said workers were already having difficulty coping with inflation caused by the Tax Reform Acceleration and Inclusion (Train) Law in all food and non-food necessities, and any additional deductions from their take-home pay would push them deeper into poverty.But Tanjusay said they would support the planned additional increase in SSS contribution if the government granted their demand for a P500 monthly cash subsidy for all minimum wage earners and if needed reforms were implemented, such as improved collection and prosecution of delinquent employers.The subsidy proposal was among the issues brought out by leaders of organized labor during their recent meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte in Malacañang.The group said the P500 subsidy would help the 4 million minimum wage earners cope with the rising inflation and surging cost of living.Under the group’s proposal, the subsidy should only be limited to minimum wage earners who are members of good standing of the SSS for at least six months.The government needs P2 billion a month or P24 billion a year to provide the P500 monthly cash subsidy.The President, according to labor leaders, was receptive to the idea and instructed the labor group to form a study group on the proposed subsidy.",1

"Law students from the Ateneo de Manila University on Friday urged Solicitor General Jose Calida to stand firm on the 25-percent shading threshold imposed by the Commission on Elections (Comelec) during the May 2016 automated elections.The law students brought their letter-request to the Office of the Solicitor General in Makati City after the Supreme Court, convened as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), ordered the Comelec to comment on Vice President Leni Robredo’s appeal asking the PET to void its decision to enforce a 50-percent minimum ballot-shading requirement.The PET implemented the new policy for the revision of ballots in the electoral protest filed by former Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against Robredo, who had earlier warned that the 50-percent shading threshold would only disenfranchise voters.Constitutional dutyRobert Escalante, president of the Ateneo Law School Student Council, said it was Calida’s constitutional duty as the state’s top lawyer to defend government agencies despite the fact that the solicitor general had openly supported Marcos’ candidacy.“Regardless of whether or not he campaigned for a certain candidate, it’s still his constitutional mandate to represent the government,” Escalante said.Xamantha Xophia Santos, president of the Council of Interns of the Ateneo Human Rights Center, said the Comelec had already ruled that the 25-percent threshold should be the standard in the shading of ballots.DisenfranchisedThe law students told Calida that even supporters of Marcos would be disenfranchised should the PET impose the new rule.They pointed out that the 25-percent shading threshold was the same standard set by the Senate Electoral Tribunal and the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal in settling electoral protests.“To ensure that the people’s voices are heard through their votes, it is necessary that we use the same threshold for all positions in the 2016 elections,” the group said.",1

"Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) administrator Reynaldo Velasco has called on all major stakeholders from both government and private sector to pool their resources together and protect the country’s forest cover and watersheds to ensure water security and sustainable development.Velasco said the country’s forest cover within forestland was now only 51.2 percent or 8.08 million hectares had remained forestlands which meant the area had not been forested and the remaining 48.8 percent comprised of 38.6 percent (6.10 million ha) forested and 10.2 percent (1.61 million ha) new forest.Velasco recently addressed close to 1,000 delegates at the PhilWater 2017 Conference in Bohol organized by the Philippine Waterworks Association with the theme, “Shared Water Resources in River Basins for Sustainable Management and Development.”Citing a Philippine Development Plan data, Velasco said the Philippines was blessed with abundant water resources with the country’s 421 principal and 18 major river basins and renewable water totaling 479 billion cubic meters from which water could be drawn for beneficial use.“These water resources, however, are threatened with wanton disregard for environmental conservation and protection. Deforestation has greatly affected our country’s watersheds,” Velasco said.He said that watersheds need trees to absorb rainwater which channeled it into streams, rivers and eventually dams where human communities source fresh water.The country, Velasco said, was faced with the sad reality that its forest cover decreased by 328,682 ha from 7,168,400 ha in 2003 to 6,839,718 ha in 2010, which represented an annual forest cover loss of 46,954 ha.",1
"Manny Pacquiao is in an unenviable position right now. He has just faced all sorts of backlash in response to his statement that “homosexuals are worse than animals.” Nike has recently dropped their contract with him. His Senate run seems in peril. To the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) community in the Philippines, all seems right with the world now.The single greatest icon of Pinoy Pride is now indelibly cast as a homophobe. It’s the end of the world!Or is it?If one evaluates the prevailing mood based primarily on the social media activity, one will get the conclusion that Manny Pacquiao is finished in the Philippines. Reception to him and his actions, including his “apology”, has been dominantly negative. The cat simply cannot be put back in the bag anymore.The question is, however, does the sentiment on social media necessarily represent that of the majority of the Philippines?Despite attempts by the social media crowd to portray itself as liberal, progressive, and all that stuff, Filipino society largely still remains ignorant, intolerant, conservative, stubbornly attached to their bibles, and generally apathetic and uncaring of what “hipsters” think.In other words, the numbers just don’t add up.The “hipsters” or “activists” are now busy engaging in a campaign to convince the rest of the Philippines not to vote for Pacquiao because of his stance against the gay community, his stance against the RH bill, and his general lack of qualifications for any government post, for that matter.Since when, however, did Filipinos ever use platforms or positions held by candidates in order to evaluate whom they’ll vote for? Filipinos vote with their heart, their feet, and their stomach. In other words, they’ll go for the one who makes them feel good, and will have some sort of “compensation” for them in exchange for their troubles.It’s all about numbers. Manny Pacquiao has them in his favor. To millions of Filipinos, he is the single source of Pinoy Pride that props up any semblance of “self-esteem” they have. To millions of Filipinos, he is the Pambansang Ninong (National Godfather) who will bestow on them and share with them the fruits of all his winnings. To millions of Filipinos he is an icon not just for his boxing skills, but for standing by his religious beliefs in the face of criticism against them.The gay community and the “activists”, quite simply, do not. To millions of Filipinos, gays and other LGBT’s have no moral ascendancy simply because the Bible says so. It doesn’t help that, as some in social media have pointed out, among those who have spoken out against Manny, Vice Ganda of ABS-CBN gives off a hypocritical vibe because of his past jokes focusing on GMA reporter Jessica Soho.If I were Manny, I would simply paint myself as a victim of “religious persecution”, and as a victim of a conspiracy by the “mayaman hipsters” to impose their beliefs on the masa. And it will work. It is a ploy Manny can use to get the numbers to virtually guarantee and secure his seat in the Senate.If Manny starts losing all his other contracts, where do you think he’ll get the money to continue being the Pambansang Ninong?If Manny Pacquiao wins – and he most likely will – the Filipino people, through him, will be sending an undeniably indelible message to gays and to all the “activists”:That those who criticized and castigated Pacquiao can all go to hell, (the Bible, somehow, somewhere, supposedly says they will anyway) and;They can all go f*ck themselves. (which is, to the ignorant and “uneducated”, what gays essentially do)It will be the ultimate irony to see that the actions of these so-called “activists” will in fact accelerate the very thing that they don’t want to happen. Despite their “progressiveness”, the Philippines will most likely continue its further slide into backwardness. All because of the noise they made.[Photo courtesy: The Telegraph]",0
"Perhaps, the feudal filipino society; steeped as it is in patronage politics, is unable to produce anything but autocratic leaders. People seem unable to even conceive of a non-oligarchic rule. They are so enamored of wealthy celebrities; they cannot see that they are embracing their oppressors.There are plenty of academics and community activists who could serve as public servants. The idea that ""people like that do not go into politics"" demonstrates how brain washed the ordinary person is. Someone needs to convince the people who believe thats things will never change; that they would be better off with a different type of leadership.---------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"A tourist who spotted Special Assistant to the President (SAP) Christopher ‘Bong’ Go at an eatery in Davao City narrated how the ‘pambansang selfie’ still continued his simple life in his hometown despite of his rise to power.Cassie Japos, a tourist from Batanes who visited Davao City planned to have a breakfast in a famous eatery in Davao, but they were shock when they saw the assistant of the President there together with actor Philip Salvador.She said that people surrounded the eatery hoping for free food and photo opportunity with Go and Salvador.Go didn’t fail the people’s expectation and according to Cassie, the Presidential assistant didn’t let his bodyguards prevent people from approaching them and he even offered to hold their phone for a selfie with him.The Presidential Assistant also treat the people who asked him for free food, while his staff were assisting the eatery in preparing food for everyone.According to Cassie, Go’s attitude ‘speaks volume’ about what kind of a leader’ is President Rodrigo Duterte.This is the whole post of Cassie:All we really wanted was a peaceful breakfast at Renz’s favorite bulaloan in Bankerohan before going back to Batanes. But lo and behold, SAP Bong Go and Philip Salvador with their staff were there. There was chaos because everyone wanted free food and photo ops. We were not able to eat in peace, we opted to have our food taken out. What we got instead was an exciting morning and the realization that the President’s Special Assistant eats at our favorite karinderya! No pamati bodyguards who would hold off anyone getting near him and Phillip Salvador. Instead, Sir Bong Go offered to hold my phone for a selfie with him. If that wouldn’t excite a regular person, I don’t know what will.🤗🙌🏻 By the way, SAP paid for everyone’s order. His staff were extremely nice, giving rice to everybody and assisting the karinderya’s staff in giving away the food. That speaks volume about what kind of a leader our President is. Walang bahid ng hangin. What a nice way to start our day.♥️Go worked in Davao City for almost two decades as the personal aide of former Mayor Rodrigo Duterte.Now after his principal won the Presidential election, Go was urged by his supporters to run for the next Senatorial elections. However Go is still not deciding if he’s going to enter politics.Source:",0
