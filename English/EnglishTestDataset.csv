"BUHAY Partylist Rep. Lito Atienza urged his colleagues at the House of Representatives and the business sector to support his measure that seeks to institutionalize profit sharing.The senior deputy minority leader said House Bill 2625 “seeks to help our countrymen benefit from economic improvement by making sure this trickles down to our daily wage earners.”“At present, the Philippine economy is growing at a fast pace owing largely to the billions of dollars from our Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), as well as the BPO industry. If the investors and financiers are making so much money today, they should be sharing more with our low wage earners and rank and file. This bill aims to guarantee that the movement in our economy is immediately shared to the lowest levels,” Atienza said during the hearing of the Committee on Labor and Employment.Under the bill, all business establishments that made a profit for a fiscal year shall annually distribute 10 percent of their net income to all their employees, both regular and contractual. The total amount given by the company thru profit sharing shall be tax creditable.“This entails no sacrifice on the part of the investors because whatever is shared with their employees becomes tax-deductible for the succeeding year. When we filed this bill during the 16th Congress, it was approved unanimously by the committee. In fact, all the members of the committee expressed their support by becoming principal sponsors together with this representation. All the employees’ groups who participated in the hearings during the 16th Congress were excited about it because they realized it would give them a bigger share in the growing economy of the country,” Atienza said.Rep. Mark Go of Baguio City expressed support for Atienza’s bill.“Once you initiate this profit sharing scheme, you will also encourage people to improve their performance because they know that if they improve their performance, it will also improve the amount that will be shared among them by the end of the year. This is the most beautiful bill,” he said.Labor Undersecretary Bernard Olalia also backed the measure, citing Article 13, Section 3 of the Constitution as basis which mandates that “the State shall regulate the relations between workers and employers, recognizing the right of labor to its just share in the fruits of production and the right of enterprises to reasonable returns of investments, and to expansion and growth.”“We urge the participation of all sectors concerned. Let’s discuss this proposed law so that we are able to clarify issues at the committee level. Let us show the whole country that we are committed to providing more opportunities for our people who have suffered long enough,” Atienza said.",1
"THE ANGER GAMESI am already sated and inundated with anything that has got to do with Leila de Lima. To my mind she is already kaput, and her jailing is but a mere formality. And I have it on good authority that her arrest and incarceration is just a matter of time...What bothers me more are the forces behind her. Looking at her presscon yesterday reminds me of the LPheld last May 7 at the Quezon Memorial Circle. She is surrounded by the same coterie that has campaigned hard for Mar Roxas and Leni Robredo. Foremost is Karina Constantino David, who is the chief strategist of the """" slogan of RoRo.Obviously, these people are not fighting for truth, justice or the perceived harassment and shaming of de Lima.These people are working to bring down a legitimate government with a clear mandate. Why? Because they are the ones affected by the cleansing and purging that the present administration is valiantly pursuing.Because they are the elite and the oligarchy who lorded it over the past 30 years, and would not easily give up the power, wealth and influence they immensely enjoyed, at the expense of the ordinary citizenry.They are the same bunch who made our mundane lives more miserable.They are the ones who corrupted the system to milk it dry while we ended up with poor infrastructure and a perpetual cycle of mess and patch up remedy. Note that the remedy is always shortsighted and temporary because this is where they earn more.They are the leadership who manipulated the system so craftily to look good on the outside, but so hollow on the inside, like the favorite """" we like to munch but will have problems later with indigestion and tooth decay.They are the ones who drove our skilled workers to migrate elsewhere because they did not offer jobs here with decent wages.These are the same group of incompetent and uncaring leaders, headed by two pedigreed scions of landlords and political bigwigs who are so clueless of the true state of the nation, even as one of them became president out of sheer luck while the other and his mother was so desperate to become one but can't make the grade despite the billions they threw away.Aside from de Lima, we also have to be wary of other, and actually more sinister, lieutenants of this political machinery, that hides under the majesty of the legislature. We have to watch out for Franklin Drilon, Antonio Trillanes, Risa Hontiveros, Francis Pangilinan and Bam Aquino.They would like nothing more than to bring back the status quo, especially because their ineptitude as lawmakers are now unravelling.No matter how subtle they try to appear, their appearance and pronouncements betray their motives and intent, particularly their stance on the war on drugs and corruption, which they are vehemently opposing under the guise of human rights violation.The hypocrisy of their acts can't be denied, when they even attempt to legislate information dissemination and curtail the phenomenon known as social media.This is how brazen they are, not because they care for the republic and its citizens.All they care about is their self preservation, and to continue to provide a governance that perpetuates mediocrity, illiteracy and poverty.The subterfuge is so cunning that we keep on electing them. They want us to remain to be dumb, to be poor, and to be miserable because they are like vultures who want to feast on our carcasses.In a way, they are a dictatorship that do not dictate, but simply to govern in such a way as to foster apathy and indifference.In the last 3 decades, they have succeeded.Until now.Because the tipping point has arrived, this country is ready for an authentic upheaval. There is great sense of engagement never before embraced by a citizenry that has reached its peak tolerance and patience.It would be a gross mistake to ignore or to dismiss this outrage and to belittle it by the traditional manipulation that worked before.This time, it is vastly different.When the siren calls out, you can bet your life that change is not coming.It is already here.And we will fight to let it in completely.-----------------------Mark Lopez as posted on Facebook",0
"Everybody is talking about “polar vortex,’ the weather phonomenon that has brought extreme frigid temperatures in the mid and eastern sections of the United States. So is Sarah Palin.In a townhall meeting aimed at debunking claims of global warming, the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate said that the record winter weather currently being experienced by many Americans is proof that “the globe is not getting warmer as claimed by leftist environmentalists.” “As a matter of fact, the globe is becoming colder,” she added.When asked by an audience member what she thinks of the polar vortex, Palin said that environmentalists and citizens alike should do all they can to protect this endangered arctic animal.Apparently, Palin thought that polar vortex is one of the animals found in Alaska, Canada and other places in the arctic region like the polar bear, muskox, caribou and arctic fox.",0
"Opposition forces led by former President Benigno Aquino III and Vice President Leni Robredo gathered on Saturday at the site of the historic 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution in a show of resistance against the Duterte administration over what they described as threats to democracy, among them the brutal war on drugs and the Friday arrest of staunch Duterte critic Sen. Leila de Lima.Although he did not address the crowd, Aquino said the Edsa celebration this year should go beyond “mere remembrance.”“Perhaps this is a reminder to all of us that the fight is not over,” Aquino said, adding that “those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.”Robredo, who also did not address the crowd, said in an interview that celebrating the Edsa event should remind the people of the power they wield.“We should not forget that power is with the people. Whatever we want to fight for, we can do it if we stand united,” she said.SolidarityWearing black to show solidarity with some 6,000 protestors at the People Power Monument in Quezon City, Aquino also rejected allegations by Duterte spokespersons that supporters of the previous administration were part of destabilization moves.“How can we be causing destabilization when we are actually offering to help?” Aquino asked.But the former President denounced the government’s shabby treatment of De Lima, a staunch critic of the drug war, who was arrested on Friday on drug charges based on testimonies by drug convicts.De Lima, Aquino’s former justice secretary, said the arrest was an act of “political persecution” and revenge for her decade-long efforts to expose Mr. Duterte as head of the Davao Death Squad during his term as city mayor.On Saturday morning, some 1,000 demonstrators trooped to Camp Aguinaldo to warn that the crackdown on drugs could foreshadow a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship that was toppled in a bloodless “people power” revolt 31 years ago.“We are taking the matter seriously. We are warning our people about the threat of rising fascism,” said protest leader Bonifacio Ilagan of the Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses in Malacañang.Ilagan, a playwright who was tortured for over two years in a police prison under Marcos’ martial rule in the 1970s, cited the “culture of impunity” arising from the extrajudicial killings because of Mr. Duterte’s total war on drugs.Mr. Duterte, 71, won the presidential election last year on the campaign promise to eradicate illegal drugs by killing tens of thousands of people. Some 7,000 drug suspects have been killed in police operations and under murky circumstances, sources said.Across the city on Saturday, hundreds of Duterte supporters began gathering at Rizal Park in Manila for a planned overnight vigil to demonstrate public backing for the President’s drug crackdown.One of the banners at the site identified its owners as “Friends of Bongbong Marcos,” the dictator’s son and namesake whom Mr. Duterte had introduced as “possibly the country’s next Vice President” during his China visit last year.The younger Marcos had lodged an election protest against Robredo, claiming fraud in the computerized vote.Genuine changeThousands of left-wing activists meanwhile marched on the main highway in Manila to demand “genuine change” promised by the President, calling for the resumption of peace talks with Maoist-led rebels and release of more than 400 political prisoners.Former President Fidel Ramos and former Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, hailed as the heroes of the 1986 revolution, attended a Mass at the main army base in Manila to mark the anniversary, which Mr. Duterte skipped.Earlier on Saturday, riot police had hosed down a group of at least 100 people protesting the drug killings at the US Embassy in Manila, though no one was seriously injured.At La Salle Green Hills chapel in Mandaluyong City on Saturday afternoon, an ecumenical Mass on Saturday to mark the Edsa revolution’s 31st year ended with the “Oratio Imperata” (obligatory prayer) to end extrajudicial killings. The prayer is usually invoked for calamities.The Mass, celebrated by Fr. Jose Ramon Villarin, was attended by the laity and members of civil society groups who later proceeded to the People Power Monument.“Let us express our opposition against violent ways which do not recognize our human rights. At every turn, let us protest all forms of authoritarianism. Let us make a stand for the return of people power, of our faith in our ability to change and better our country through peaceful and humane means,” the De La Salle Philippines president, Brother Jose Mari Jimenez, said during the homily.Blues, greens, yellowsA group of nuns led by Sr. Regina Kuizon of the Association of Major Religious Superiors of Women in the Philippines also read a statement calling for political unity: “Today, there are blues, there are greens, there are yellows, and God gave us a multitude of colors to celebrate … a God who tells us to love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”Several opposition political figures affiliated with the Liberal Party also attended the Mass, among them Robredo and Senators Bam Aquino, Franklin Drilon, Francis Pangilinan and Risa Hontiveros.Civic ignoranceMeanwhile on Friday, constitutional expert Christian Monsod warned students at a forum at the University of the Philippines School of Economics against “civic ignorance” that breeds tyrants.“[If] we do not do anything about it and prefer to live with our frustrations about who is accountable for things that go wrong, someone will eventually come and say, ‘I will solve all your problems if you give me total power,’” the former Commission on Elections chair said.“And we will give it to him. That’s when democracy dies,” Monsod said, paraphrasing the words of former US Supreme Court Justice David Souter five years before US President Donald Trump and Mr. Duterte came into power.“We are told by the present government that the problem of our country is imperial Manila, hence the need to shift to federalism,” he addedBut Monsod acknowledged: “I submit that we have failed in development not because of the Constitution, but because we have not fully implemented it, especially its provisions on social justice and on local autonomy. The Constitution is not the problem, it is part of the solution.”Monsod described Mr. Duterte as an enigma because of “inconsistent messages and behavior, language that the civil society does not accept, inability to dialogue because he is not a good listener and muddled governance because of ad hoc or case-to-case decisions.”Even so, he said he was convinced that the President’s heart “is with the poor.”“His propoor agenda is correct, but the means he wants to use are wrong,” Monsod said, referring to drug-related killings.For all the promise of a new social order that the 1986 Edsa revolution represented, Monsod said it ended in failure. “[As] we went our separate ways with our separate causes, we lost something of the dream of a nation and the significance of interconnected lives,” he said.“You may ask—have we failed Edsa? My answer is yes,” Monsod said.",1
"On President Rodrigo Duterte’s 100 days of office, he distributed equipment tofarmers and fishermen worth P100-million in the Province of Basilan along withAgriculture Secretary Manny Pinol.The machinery included cassava granulation, corn mills, tractors, corn and rice seeds, fertilisers, seaweed farming tools and Fiberglass fishing boats.Aside from the equipment, he was also able to provide interventions that are estimated to be worth P1-billion as he aims to focus on production of food and wiping out poverty on provinces.Upon the distribution, people from Basilan burst into tears as they received the 70 units of the 1,000 Fiberglas fishing boats together with engines, fishing nets, hooks and line.Meanwhile, the farmers were given first of the 7 units of 4-wheel drive tractors which will be used in farming of cassava and corn particularly in places affected by cocolisap.",0
"If they don’t shell out P30,000 for the dropping of a case for possession of a bullet against her stepson, the price would rise to P80,000 if the matter reaches police headquarters, according to the stepmother of an American missionary, who allegedly fell prey to the “tanim-bala” (bullet-planting) scheme at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia).Eloisa Zoleta and her stepson, Lane Michael White, recounted to the Senate Thursday their experience at Naia in September after security officials allegedly found a bullet in his bag.Police officers told them to pay P30,000 for dropping the case against White, even as they pressed them to admit to the owning the bullet.But the pair refused to settle the matter and insisted on White’s innocence.At the time, the family was on the way to Coron, Palawan province, to scout for land on which to build a church.Zoleta said a bullet was found after White’s bag passed through the X-ray machine several times.Nothing was detected when the bag was first checked, but after screening officer Maria Elma Cena allegedly put her hand inside the flap of White’s bag, the bullet was discovered in the next X-ray scan, she said.After they were informed of the discovery, Zoleta asked the screening officers if she should have their flights to Coron moved. They told her it would be an easy matter, a remark that she found baffling if there really had been a violation of the law.“The screening officers said, ‘That’s OK. It would be easy,’” she said, adding that Cena even told her that the flight wasn’t even until 12:45 p.m.“I was thinking that if it was really the law and there was one ammo found in the luggage, shouldn’t their answer be that we wouldn’t be able to go to Coron because they would jail my son? Shouldn’t that be the answer if they were implementing it?” she said.White was subsequently brought to the office of the Philippine National Police, while Zoleta tried to take care of their tickets.Police officer JunioShe said a PNP officer she identified only as “PNP officer Junio” asked her about what had happened. After explaining, Junio told her about paying for the dropping of the case, she said.“Usually we let the possession of such items pass. We just say it’s an amulet. If we negotiate that here, it (will cost you) P30,000. But if it’s passed on to headquarters, it’s P80,000,” Zoleta recalled the police officer as saying.Preacher with no salaryHe also asked about her husband’s job and she informed him he was a preacher who did not receive a salary. The officer also asked about White’s job and she told him he had resigned from his job.Their conversation ended then because Zoleta’s brother called her up, and she never saw the police officer again.White also said a police officer, Rolando Clarin, had told him he could pay P30,000 or face the prospect of jail. But he said the bullet was not his and he did not have the amount.Zoleta said the officers had tried to convince them to own up to the bullet possession.She said another officer had appealed to her to help White, as he was a foreigner and his life could be ruined.PregnantAnd as they were about to head for White’s inquest, Zoleta said Cena came up to her and told her that she could have just admitted to carrying the bullet since she was pregnant, and there was a humanitarian law.“I responded to her, ‘ma’am, why would I admit it?’ I know that’s the easier way out to say it’s ours and I’m pregnant, but I told her we’re Christians. We can’t lie about a small thing just to find an easy way out,” she said.UnprofessionalZoleta also said the screening officers lacked professionalism and courtesy when dealing with them.She also recounted that she started taking videos, upon her brother’s advice, after the bullet was found. Her camera was not hidden and was near her armpit, she said.When the screening officers learned that she had taken videos, they seemed surprised she said. She also recalled that Clarin had warned her not to take videos, and that he would fine her if she did so.Zoleta and White were among the air passengers invited to the Senate, which is looking into allegations that a syndicate planting bullets in passengers’ bags to extort money from them was operating at Naia.OFWAlso present at the hearing was overseas Filipino worker (OFW) Gloria Ortinez, who is now unsure of whether she still had a job waiting for her in Hong Kong.Ortinez had been detained and faced a complaint after a bullet was supposedly found in her bag. The case against her was dismissed, but there is no certainty yet if her employer would take her back.Ortinez also recalled that after the bullet was found, the X-ray personnel brought her to a room that had men in white uniform.Made to sign documentShe said she was asked to sign a document and she initially refused, she was told she would be handcuffed if she would not follow the order. She was not made to read the document, but she eventually signed it, she said.She also said the officers had tried to convince her to admit that she owned the bullet.Finger-pointingSenators took to task aviation officials for “finger-pointing” when asked to provide them the closed-circuit TV (CCTV) footage of the inspection of White’s bag.The footage was necessary for White’s case. The National Bureau of Investigation requested copies, but it has yet to get these.Rolando Recomono, chief of the Office for Transportation Security (OTS), said the CCTV footage was not under his office’s jurisdiction and was with the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA).But MIAA general manager Jose Angel Honrado said it was with the OTS.“Which jurisdiction does it fall under? Janitorial offices?” asked Sen. Teofisto Guingona III, chair of the blue ribbon committee.“How will the victims get justice now?” Guingona asked.Honrado eventually said MIAA had custody of CCTV footage taken at the airport as it was operating the cameras. He also said the OTS had a copy of the footage.MIAA has not provided copies to the NBI as the bureau made the request to the OTS, he said.“This is a clear case of finger-pointing,” Guingona said.Passenger’s sideIn another development, Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano castigated officials for not getting the side of the air passenger, who complained of being victimized by the supposed bullet-planting scheme.Zoleta said nobody from the OTS or the aviation offices got in touch with her, and Cayetano pointed to the promise of transportation officials that they would investigate the allegations.Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya said he believed the complainants were not guilty and had no intent to violate the law.But Abaya also said the investigations were ongoing. The probe has been turned over to the Aviation Security Group, which then coordinates with the prosecutor. This is the judicial process, he said.Cayetano said the case should not enter the judicial process until the side of the passengers, who claim they fell prey to the bullet-planting scheme, was heard.“If they weren’t even asked and they complained, so at that level, there was no due process,” he said.If the passengers had not gone to the Senate, the officials would not have heard their side, he added.",1
"There will be no break for Metro Manila policemen during the holidays.Metro police chief Oscar Albayalde on Saturday said policemen in Metro Manila were not allowed to take a leave during the Christmas season.Albayalde declared a “no break policy” for the five police districts in Metro Manila to ensure a high level of police visibility.District directors were ordered to deploy policemen in Catholic churches to protect the faithful from criminals and terrorists.Albayalde also ordered police officers to strengthen their safety and security measures. He said the police will be on “full alert” during the holiday season.Albayalde’s order is in line with President Rodrigo Duterte’s statement that he will not order the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to stop operations against the New People’s Army (NPA), the armed unit of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) during the celebration of Christmas and New Year.The head of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) called on the public to report suspicious individuals to the police.“We encourage the public to welcome the presence of our police in areas they frequent for prayers or shopping however, report any suspicious individuals or groups so that we can immediately extend police assistance,” Albayalde said in a statement.He warned that police personnel who would be reported for misconduct by civilians will be held responsible by their supervisors.“I reiterate also my previous instruction that all immediate supervisors will be held responsible for the deeds and misdeeds of their personnel,” Albayalde said.According to Albayalde, police inspections in crime-prone areas will be conducted by his office and its “Red Teams” at any given time. He said they would also conduct “Oplan Sita,” an operation against motorcycle-riding criminals.“Likewise, I also ordered the maximized deployment of our Special Reactions Units for Oplan Sita in critical or crime-prone areas,” the police official said.He called on police personnel to celebrate the Christmas season where they are assigned since no holiday break would be given to them.“We will celebrate with the community where we are assigned,” Albayalde said.WITH RJ CARBONELL",1
"Rhode Islanders feel slighted that Bostonians get all the glory for helping spark the American Revolution with the Boston Tea Party. After all, more than a year before any tea was tossed, Rhode Island colonists burned a British ship.Saturday is the 246th anniversary of the day a local ship captain lured the British schooner HMS Gaspee into shallow waters a few miles south of Providence, where it ran aground. A smaller model of a ship will be burned Sunday to commemorate the forgotten act of rebellion.U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse often recounts the story of how colonists waited till night fell, rowed out to the stranded Gaspee, shot the ship’s captain and burned the boat. It’s a cool story about an extraordinary act, said the Rhode Island Democrat. By comparison, he said, Massachusetts patriots mustered the courage to push tea off the deck of a British boat more than a year later.“It’s going to be a long, slow process to try to correct 240 years of the Massachusetts megaphone, but I think it is important to stick up for historic deeds that were done by Rhode Islanders,” said Whitehouse, who spoke about the Gaspee Affair Monday on the Senate floor.Many Rhode Island residents feel similarly aggrieved.Historians say the affair reignited patriotic fervor at a time when it had cooled off, and emboldened Bostonians. The chief historian at the recently opened Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia believes Rhode Islanders have a legitimate point about its importance being overlooked.“There’s a period where there’s hope that maybe things could simmer down, but right in the middle of it, this Gaspee Affair happens,” Philip Mead said. “It’s really a foreshadowing of what will happen with the Boston Tea Party, because both sides react very strongly to each other.”Seth Rockman, who teaches at Brown University in Providence about the Revolution, thinks people should know more about the Gaspee Affair. But the fact of the matter is, he said, it’s not as important as the Boston Tea Party, which set so many more events in motion after it happened in December 1773.“On the one hand, yes, a full accounting of the coming of the American Revolution should probably draw attention to the Gaspee as a significant moment,” he said. “On the other hand, should people in Rhode Island be worked up about it?”The Gaspee was sent to Narragansett Bay in 1772 to enforce trade laws. The colonists were soon fed up with the Gaspee and its captain, Lt. William Dudingston, stopping ships and disrupting trade, especially after rum was seized from local merchant Jacob Greene, said Steven Park, who wrote a book about the affair.The Gaspee ran aground on June 9, 1772. Colonists in Providence heard the news and rowed out to it. Later, no one would tell King George III who set fire to the ship. The Sons of Liberty in Boston politicized the event to resist the British government, Park added.Many historical texts were written in Boston immediately after the war and focused on Massachusetts. The now-famous revolutionary figures schoolchildren learn about weren’t involved in burning the Gaspee.“Even though we might not go so far as to say the Gaspee needs to replace the Tea Party in American consciousness, I think we can agree that those advocating for more attention for the Gaspee are right,” Mead said.The nonprofit Gaspee Days Committee marks the anniversary annually with the model-ship burning and other events in Warwick. The crew of the Gaspee was brought ashore in Pawtuxet Village in Warwick as their ship burned.“I would hope there never comes a day this legacy is not carried on,” said Ryan Giviens, committee president. “Were it written in the textbooks, it would be easier. So as long as it’s not, we’re going to keep spreading the message ourselves.”",1
"Unlike earlier Moro raids, Maute extremists appear to have “upgraded” their weapons, logistics and tactics, making it more difficult for the military to end the two-month battle for Marawi City.“Compared to previous encounters with the Maute group, this one in Marawi is an upgrade,” 1st Lt. Kent Fagyan told members of Congress during its special session on the extension of martial law.The 29-year-old Army officer, who wore an armsling because of a combat injury, was presented to lawmakers by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea upon questioning by Sen. Richard Gordon.“They have many 50-cal. [guns], radio frequency scanners. They have drones and their ammunition appears to be unlimited,” said Fagyan, who led a reconnaissance company of the 1st Infantry Division.Fagyan said he based his assessment on his experience from the three-week siege of Zamboanga City in September 2013, and the Maute group’s raid on Butig, Lanao del Sur province, in November last year.Improved tacticsAside from improved weapons and logistics, the extremists also improved their tactics from when they were just a bandit group in their Butig hometown.“What we’re doing is really difficult. As much as possible, we avoid casualties, but the enemy is good, too,” Fagyan said.They chose an urban target with commercial and residential buildings higher and closer together as compared to other places in Mindanao, he said.From elevated defensive positions, the extremists can pick off soldiers out in the streets, so troops have to make holes in the walls of houses which they then use to sneak through the city labyrinth.“The houses are near each other so we have to observe first if there are enemies. If there’s resistance, we use tear gas,” Fagyan said, adding they had also had to use recoilless rifles and grenades.The extremists were also known to leave booby traps inside a building they had previously held and Fagyan related how he and his men were almost killed when one of his men sat on a bomb rigged in a chair.Fagyan also thanked the public for their support for the military.“On behalf of my colleagues who are still fighting in Marawi, we would like to thank you for helping us because we can feel that we are not alone in fighting the enemy,” he said.“We thank you for sending clothes [and] water. It’s a big help because when you’re in the zone, you can’t eat on time. You can’t sleep because you will be awakened by gunfire here and there,” he added.",1
"The Commission on Population (PopCom) on Monday said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved all 51 contraceptives up for certification and recertification including Implanon and Implanon NXT.Resolution 2017-302 dated November 10 shows that all 51 contraceptives up for certification and recertification have been approved.Among the approved contraceptives were Implanon and Implanon NXT, which in effect would lift the 29-month temporary restraining order (TRO) of the Supreme Court (SC) in the case of Alliance for the Family Foundation Philippines Inc. against then-Health Secretary Janette Garin et al. in 2015.Under a “sunset clause,” the TRO will be lifted if the FDA complies with the mandate of the High Court and certifies Implanon and Implanon NXT as non-abortifacients.PopCom Executive Director Juan Antonio Perez welcomed the approval of the FDA on the 51 contraceptives, saying the decision “could not have come at a better time” as they can soon procure supplies for public use.“This could not have come at a better time as depleted contraceptive supplies will now be augmented by over two hundred thousand implants. Annually, one million women become new acceptors of modern family planning methods,” Perez said in a statement.“The lifting of the TRO will allow the DoH [Department of Health] to start procuring commodities from its 2017 budget. All Filipinos working for women’s health should rejoice in this development,” he added.Earlier this month, Perez said in a news conference that the full implementation of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law (RPRH) is now “on track.”“The FDA will declare contraceptives as non-abortifacients, lifting the TRO. Full implementation of the RH Law is now on track,” he said in the news briefing.The DoH also welcomed the decision of the FDA, saying it has been compliant with the SC and determined abortifacient from non-abortifacient using best available scientific evidence.Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd said the DoH is committed to implement the RPRH Law as it is their job to give Filipino families access to appropriate family planning services.“We assure everyone that the full and strict implementation of the RH Law which President Duterte ordered earlier this year will be fair, even-handed and not adversely affect our people’s health,” Duque added.The PopCom and the FDA are both agencies under the DoH.",1
"“Be faith to your duties and don’t steal.”That was the message of Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle to all public officials during Easter vigil service at Manila Cathedral on Saturday night.“We are calling on the public servants: Be honest. Don’t steal. Don’t betray the nation,” Tagle said in his homily.READ: Tagle’s Good Friday message: Don’t steal; walk with a missionThe Philippines has been rocked by corruption scandals, including charges that senators funneled their pork barrel funds to fake foundations to get hundreds of millions of pesos in kickbacks and accusations of overpricing infrastructure projects involving Vice President Jejomar Binay during his tenure as mayor of Makati City.The three-hour Easter service before midnight leading to Easter Sunday was the culmination of the Catholic Church’s Lenten season, the most important event in its calendar.IN PHOTOS: Christians in Holy Land, across world celebrate EasterHundreds of faithful participated in the vigil, which traditionally begins in pitch darkness.Tagle led the faithful into the newly renovated cathedral with only candles to light their way.Resurrection of JesusAfter nine readings, lights were turned on, signaling the resurrection of Jesus as the choir sang “Gloria in excelsis Deo” (Glory to God in the Highest).Tagle said the resurrection of Jesus was a “great expression of divine and human fidelity.”“We saw God’s faith to Jesus, Jesus’ faith to the Father, the first witnesses to Jesus. The Risen One has shown faith even to those who have sinned against him,” he said.READ: Learn to pray, Tagle tells faithful“The Feast of the Resurrection is a feast of the victory of fidelity. Let us show that we are an Easter beacon through our fidelity,” he said.Tagle invited the couples attending the vigil to renew their vows of fidelity and loyalty to each other, the children to their studies and the workers to their jobs.Year of the PoorHe likewise reminded the faithful of the Church’s teachings and views about the poor.“[In] the Year of the Poor, let us be faithful to those whom Jesus loves the most. To those who are suffering and in need,” he said.In November last year, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines declared 2015 the Year of the Poor in preparation for the visit of Pope Francis the following January.The declaration echoes the Pope’s message when he began his papacy of creating “a poor Church for the poor.”Easter is one of the most beautiful events in the Catholic Church, as it shows “pure divinity,” Tagle said.READ: Pope, thousands brave rain for Easter in St. Peter’s Square“What we are celebrating is pure grace, unadulterated grace,” he said, admitting that he himself is often nervous before presiding over the Easter Vigil.“I am nervous. I ask myself: How can you proclaim pure divinity. We are not worthy. We are humbled by this action of God,” he said.MysteryThe resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead after he was crucified is a mystery even to the Church, Tagle said. He explained that there is no written account of how it actually happened.According to the Gospel of Mark, three women—Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Salome—went to the tomb of Jesus and found it open.A young man dressed in white was inside and he told them that Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified had been raised.The young man told the women to go and tell the disciples that Jesus had risen. They went away full of fear and told no one.The Gospels of Matthew and Luke, both based on Mark, carry elaboration of the basic story in Mark but do not say how Jesus rose from the dead.In the Gospel of John, Mary Magdalene meets the risen Jesus, but the story does not describe the resurrection.With this mystery, Easter brings joy and faith, Tagle said.“What is the character of Easter joy? It is quiet, deep and sometimes it has to go through darkness. In the Gospel that we heard, the women did not see the Risen One right away. It took a while for them to see Him. Easter joy is motivated by faith,” he said.RELATED VIDEOS",1
"Officials of all Regional Peace and Order Councils (RPOCs) in Mindanao met here on Wednesday to harmonize their agenda relevant to ensuring security in the regions.The day- long meeting was presided by Interior and Local Government Secretary Ismael “Mike” Sueno and hosted at the provincial capitol complex here by Sultan Kudarat Governor Pax Mangudadatu, the newly designated RPOC chairman for Region XII or Central Mindanao.Other RPOCs chairpersons and vice chairpersons as well as some provincial governors attended the meeting, which tackled major concerns including cases of prohibited drugs, illegal gambling, terrorism and insurgency.Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Governor Mujiv Hataman, who chairs the ARMM’s RPOC, shared much of recommendations concerning issues on insurgency and extremism affecting his region.ARMM, which covers Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi provinces and the cities of Marawi and Lamitan, hosts the major enclaves of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the Moro National Liberation Front, the outlawed Abu Sayyaf and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, and some jihadist quarters such as the Maute group.“We want to provide safe and secure atmosphere conducive to the region’s residents and investors,” Gov. Hataman said after enumerating some corresponding recommendations.On the emergence of extremism in some parts of ARMM, Maguindanao Governor Esmael Mangudadatu renewed his suggestion for government sanction on all madaris (Arabic and Islamic schools) by way of through screening and accreditation processes.He said all teachers in the madaris system should also be profiled to insure that their lectures would not include ways that encourage extremist ideology en route to jihadist or terror actions.Sueno said the synchronized meeting was aimed at harmonizing measures on how to restrain criminality, or any issue that affects the peace and order situation in Mindanao.",1
"There are those who insistently say move on. Move on from what? From fraud? From moral depravity? From shameless machination? There is also the call for unity. Unity for what? For disregarding deceit? For forgetting manipulation? For erasing prevarication? Amidst the scandalous celebration and raucous cavorting of the so-called victors, there is a great deal of people who grit their teeth in anger and lament the suppression of truth and thwarting the will of the people.Indeed, Robredo's ill-conceived triumph is a pyrrhic victory because her deceit will continue to gnaw at her and family's conscience and will hound and haunt her for the rest of her life. Even before assuming office, she is already hobbled and hampered by the grave accusation of cheating made possible by a yellow regime that will do everything to prevent an avowed enemy from occupying the vice-presidential seat ---- the same scenario that prevented GMA from governing effectively.Unless there is a satisfactory explanation on Robredo's victory, this issue will continuously divide the nation and spook her till kingdom come. The question is, why doesn't Comelec up to now allow a system audit to disabuse our minds of any irregularity and settle the issue once and for all to push the nation forward. This is no longer a contest between two VP contenders but an issue that transcends personalities and weighs upon a tainted electoral process that needs thorough cleansing.As a fellow Bicolano, I'm ashamed and aghast by what Robredo as well as her cohorts have done in desecrating the elections and trampling upon our democratic choices, while hiding behind a yellow cover to perpetrate the duplicity and treachery of Aquino!----------------------Manny Balane as posted on Facebook:https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1279201152114189&id=100000729487853",0
"Government security forces have killed 89 terrorists during more than a week of fighting in Marawi City but the gunmen are still offering strong resistance with stolen weapons and ammunition, the military said on Wednesday.Attack helicopters fired rockets repeatedly on Wednesday into the pockets of Marawi where gunmen from the Maute terror group were hiding among trapped residents, according to an Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporter who was following troops searching houses.The clashes erupted on Tuesday last week when gunmen waving black flags of the Islamic State (IS) group rampaged through the mostly Muslim-populated city in response to a military raid on the hideout of Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, who has a $5-million price on his head offered by the US government.Hapilon, who had pledged allegiance to IS, escaped but he was believed to be still in Marawi, Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla, spokesperson for the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said on Wednesday.The siege of Marawi prompted President Duterte to declare martial law in Mindanao for 60 days and suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus on the entire island during the period of military rule.Death tollEighty-nine terrorists had been killed in the efforts to reclaim the city and find Hapilon, Padilla told reporters.The count included 42 bodies recovered and 47 deaths confirmed by eyewitnesses.The dead after more than a week of fighting include 19 civilians and 21 government forces.Six policemen were “missing in action,” the Philippine National Police reported on Wednesday.Troops have cleared almost 90 percent of Marawi and rescued 960 civilians, but many residents are trapped in the 10 percent of the city that the terrorists control, Padilla said.Security forces will likely meet increasingly strong resistance there, he added.Padilla said he did not know how many terrorists remained, but added that there had been chances for the group to take in new members.“As in previous statements that we have released, the number may have [increased] … because they went to the jail to free [more than a] hundred prisoners. Quite a number of those are definitely with them already,” he said.“And then other than that, there may have been other sympathizers from other areas who may have made their way into the area earlier [in the fighting] and maybe already in their ranks,” he added.30 to 40 gunmenAnother military officer, Lt. Col. Jo-ar Herrera, spokesperson for the 1st Army Division, said 30 to 40 gunmen were fighting government troops in Banggolo, Rada Madaya and Saka Lidok villages.Herrera said around 2,000 civilians remained trapped in those villages, but the military was trying to rescue them.“There might still be around 30 to 40 [remaining gunmen] because the others are lying low, escaping, leaving their firearms behind and mixing with civilians. That’s what’s happening there,” he said.Herrera’s estimate of cleared parts of the city was smaller than Padilla’s, placing it at 80 to 85 percent, including Basak Malutlut village, where the fighting started on Tuesday last week after the failed attempt by troops from the 103rd Brigade to arrest Hapilon.He said the remaining terrorists had occupied vantage points in the three villages from where they could quickly spot approaching government forces.“They are still fighting and are still using high-powered firearms. The battlefield is very dynamic so we don’t have a deadline [for the clearing operations],” he said.The military on Wednesday deployed for the first time SF-260 close air support planes to back attack helicopters and ground troops looking to box terrorists into a downtown area.Stolen weaponsPadilla said the Maute gunmen had kept up the fight with rifles and ammunition stolen from a police station, a prison and armored police vehicle.“They were able to get an armored vehicle of the police. Inside, there is a supply of bullets,” Padilla said, adding that the ammunition was among the stolen items the gunmen were using to resist the forces being poured into the area.The terrorists also reportedly looted a gun store in Basak Malutlut and another in Banggolo as they besieged the city last Tuesday.Padilla said the terrorists opted for urban warfare because arms were available in the city and homes and shops provided ample supplies of food.“Yes, indeed, there was planning involved,” he added.The military has from the outset insisted it has control of the situation, but the slow pace of efforts to retake Marawi has prompted questions about its strategy.That has been compounded by social media images of smiling fighters with assault rifles posing on the captured, US-made police combat vehicle, dressed in black and wearing headbands typical of IS.Another picture showed a bearded man at the wheel of a police van flying an IS flag.The authenticity of the images has not been independently verified and the military has urged the public not to spread “propaganda.”Foreign fightersAs for reports of foreigners fighting alongside Maute terrorists, Padilla said there were indications that some of those killed in the fighting were not Filipinos.The foreigners looked Asian, he said.“With the amount of material that has been coming out and being recovered [from] the areas of conflict, there could be, in this collection of documents and other materials, proof that would indicate the existence of these foreign fighters,” he said.Earlier operations in Mindanao have shown that eight to 12 foreigners have been helping armed groups on the island, he added.Reuters, quoting a Philippine intelligence source, reported on Tuesday that as many as 40 of the terrorists who overran Marawi last week had recently arrived from overseas, including from countries in the Middle East.The foreigners included Indonesians, Malaysians, at least one Pakistani, a Saudi Arabian, a Chechen, a Yemeni, an Indian, a Moroccan and one man with a Turkish passport, Reuters quoted the intelligence source as saying.",1

"ANTI-crime advocates condemned on Monday the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the release from jail of former Palawan Gov. Joel Reyes, the alleged mastermind in the killing of broadcaster Gerry Ortega in 2011.Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) Chairman Dante Jimenez said the appellate court ruled in favor of Reyes despite enormous evidence and testimonies that supported the allegation that Reyes was responsible for Ortega’s death.“We are very disappointed with the decision. But we also know that the decision is not yet final and that the Ortega family could still bring the case to the Supreme Court,” Jimenez said.The CA special division voted 3-2 to dismiss the murder complaint filed against Reyes and ordered the lower court to stop hearing the case.Reyes was released on January 5.Ortega, who was also an environmentalist and a civic leader, was gunned down by a hired gunman on January 24, 2011 in Puerto Princesa, Palawan.Prior to his death, Ortega has been critical of the former Palawan governor and other local officials of the province because of the alleged use of Malampaya funds.Reyes, his brother, former Coron Mayor Mario Reyes, and other individuals were charged with murder.Reyes and his brother went into hiding in 2012.The Reyes brothers were arrested in Phuket, Thailand in October 2015.The CA, in its ruling said the Regional Trial Court in Palawan has no basis to continue with the trial and should stop the hearing of the case.“Why would the CA stop a lower court from hearing the case? They ruled in favor of Reyes when other suspects in the case have been convicted,” Jimenez said.AppealThe VACC found an ally in the Palace, which vowed that the Duterte administration will leave no stone unturned in appealing the appellate court’s decision.“The President remains the chief implementor of the laws. The case was filed by the Executive department, and we have gotten the decision of the Regional Trial Court that there is a strong evidence of guilt against Joel Reyes, prompting the court to deny his petition for bail. As such, we will exercise all legal options to reverse this decision of the CA,” Palace spokesman Harry Roque said.“The government will exhaust all remedies, including filing a motion for reconsideration. I will meet with Solicitor General [Jose] Calida and Justice Secretary [Vitaliano] Aguirre this week to address this case,” he added.Roque, who served as legal counsel in the Ortega case prior to his election to congress as Kabayan party-list representative in June 2016, said President Rodrigo Duterte authorized him to express his comments assailing the CA ruling that cleared Reyes.He said the Supreme Court already issued a ruling that the RTC should determine if there was probable cause so it would be absurd for the CA to issue a contrary decision.“The presentation of evidence by the prosecution and the defense were already done before I was elected to Congress. It is not true that this case [vs. Governor Reyes] is a miracle. It is a travesty of justice. The petition [lodged before the CA] is on whether there is probable cause to charge Governor Reyes. The Supreme Court already ruled on that,” Roque said, referring to the ruling penned by Associate Justice Marvic Leonen.“The decision of the lower court said that the evidence of guilt was strong against former Governor Reyes, that is why I find it alarming that the CA decision overruled a Supreme Court decision, [and that the CA] assumed the judgment of the lower court which had the opportunity to see the physical evidence, see and probe the demeanor of the witnesses,” he added.with LLANESCA T.

"Saying its “ultimate client” is the republic, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) has formally withdrawn as counsel for the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) in the case seeking the demolition of the controversial high-rise Torre de Manila.The withdrawal came amid the OSG’s divergent position with the agency over the legality of the so-called Rizal Monument “photobomber,” which recently prompted NHCP Chair Maria Serena Diokno to get a private counsel, her brother, Jose Manuel Diokno.In a manifestation filed in the Supreme Court on Monday, Solicitor General Florin Hilbay said the OSG could not accommodate the NHCP stand on the matter “without compromising the OSG’s statutory duty to articulate a legal argument that will best serve its ultimate client, the republic.”“…[W]hen an agency, as an immediate client, recommends a position to the OSG that is contrary to interests of the government, the OSG can decline representing said agency,” Hilbay said in the pleading.“It is thus respectfully manifested that the OSG can neither represent the NHCP in this case nor can it collaborate with the NHCP’s counsel,” he said.3 impleaded agenciesThe OSG had represented the NHCP in the case, being among three government agencies impleaded in the Knights of Rizal’s petition for the demolition of the 49-story Torre de Manila, a DM Consunji Inc. project, for obstructing the vista of the Rizal Monument.The two others—the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the National Museum (NM",1
"After a bleak celebration of the New Year’s holidays owing to a massive power shutdown, this capital is no longer groping in the dark.The power supply was fully restored in this capital town on Friday night after the Abra Electric Cooperative (ABREC), in coordination with Governor Ma.

"Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada distributed wheelchairs to senior citizens in select areas in District 3 recently. Estrada said the distribution of wheelchairs is an extra treat for the senior citizens to go around anywhere. “There will be more wheelchairs to come in the succeeding weeks,” he added. Earlier, six Manileños who reached their 100th birthday were honored and gifted with P100,000 each by Estrada at the San Andres Sports Complex. He said the cash handouts from the city government were a token of appreciation for the centenarians’ contributions to society during the prime of their lives. “You have sacrificed much so that the present generation now enjoys the fruits of your labors,” Estrada added.

Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd had three votes.To be shortlisted to the post of Ombudsman, an applicant must win at least four votes from the JBC.The JBC is constitutionally mandated to screen nominees for vacant posts in the judiciary and the Offices of the Ombudsman and Deputy Ombudsman.Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales will step down on July 26 after completing her seven-year term of office.Only six of the seven members of the JBC are expected to vote since Jose Mejia, who represented the Academe, ended his four-year term in the JBC on July 7.The Manila Times sources said Mejia is hoping to return as a JBC regular member to represent the Academe along with retired Sandiganbayan Justice Rodolfo Ponferrada.Mejia is the fraternity brother of Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez in Utopia fraternity while Ponferrada, a Davaeño, was a classmate and fraternity brother of President Rodrigo Duterte in the Lex Talionis fraternity.The President will decide if he will renew the appointment of Mejia for another term or appoint Ponferrada.The esx-officio members of the JBC are Sen. Richard Gordon and Rep. Reynaldo Umali, and Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra. Gordon and Umali share their terms since congress is entitled only to one vote in the JBC.Retired SC Justice Jose Catral-Mendoza is the head of the Executive Committee.

When he was still in the Sandiganbayan, he cleared then Davao City Mayor Duterte from graft charges.Martires is the lone SC Justice applying for the anti-graft body position, and if appointed to the Ombudsman post, he will have to go on optional retirement in the high court.Bello, who hails from Davao, was also a former lawmaker and Justice Secretary.He and Duterte have known each other since their school days in a YMCA dormitory.Another applicant is Atty. Edna Batacan, a veteran lawyer handling Sandiganbayan and Ombudsman cases.

"switching still goes on, with politicians abandoning their home parties to join the so-called “super” majority. This proves the absence of ideological or principled moorings in Philippine politics.I wonder how politicians can switch alliances or allegiances from one end of the political/ideological spectrum to the other end with such ease. Those who switch show not the slightest sign of regrets or remorse.Fish would have a problem switching habitats from water to land or air. Most mammals would be in peril if they moved from land to water. Dinosaurs disappeared from the face of the Earth because they couldn’t adapt to environmental changes.But Filipino politicians have no such problems. They’re so adaptable, they flit from one party or coalition to another without skipping a beat. The dinosaurs would be envious.This proves that ideology or party principles are not a part of the original motivation to join a political party. To gain political power has always been and is the only incentive to become a member.Look at the wholesale transfer of partisans to another grouping. Even high-ranking leaders of parties move. What does that say about their principles and character, and their sworn duty to lead? It’s like the captain abandoning his own ship and crew.It’s questionable but understandable when politicians who espouse no particular ideology or party platforms switch parties. Nothing binds them to their original party anyway, so what’s there to stop them from switching parties?But the observer scratches his or her head when known ideologues do it. How, for example, does someone known for fighting for human rights suddenly move to the side of a leader who doesn’t care at all about human rights? How does someone who had been strident against human rights violations suddenly become a defender of a leader who disregards the importance of individuals’ rights in a democracy and indeed even threatens rights advocates of harm?How easy is it really to move from one end of the spectrum to the other end? No qualms of conscience? No withdrawal symptoms? No shame from the jeers of former colleagues or partisans? No self-indictment? No remorse?Or, is it all because of power and ambition? Does the closeness to the seat of power make up for the feeling of abandoning one’s principles and beliefs? Does the sense of belonging to the inner circle of government compensate for the nagging conscience? Does a Cabinet post, for example, make up for the devil’s barter?Or, is conscience not even a part of the equation at all?“What profits a man if he gains the world but loses his soul?” Is constant public exposure glory enough to sacrifice former beliefs? Perhaps that is what motivates many people to switch allegiances from one’s principles to another set of considerations.It’s a common practice in Philippine politics to switch alliances. That makes it easier for politicians to rationalize their switching of loyalties by saying to themselves: If others can do it, so can I.But’s it’s still hard to imagine or explain for the common observer.***Tantrum Ergo. ABS-CBN’s rail transit reporter pronounces “MRT” as EMR-TEE instead of EM-AHR-TEE and “LRT” as ELR-TEE instead of EL-AHR-TEE. Just like when some people pronounce the department store’s name “SM” as ES(I)M instead of ES-EM. Please, people, stop making pa-cute; I still haven’t gotten over the fact that so many Filipinos now say “TWENNY” instead of TWEN-TEE or “GENNEL-MEN” instead of GEN-TEL-MEN. Pa-cute pa more.",1

"SEN. LEILA de Lima on Monday said she had witnesses who could testify against police “scalawags” allegedly behind the summary executions of suspected drug dealers to cover up their involvement in the narcotics trade.In an open letter in Filipino, De Lima urged Mr. Duterte “to follow the inquiry” of the Senate committee on justice and human rights set to begin on Monday that would detail her allegations against certain officials of the Philippine National Police.“There is an indication that not all drug suspects are really related to, but that they just coincided with, the campaign against drugs,” she said.“There are deaths that are being done by corrupt officials and their cohorts to cover up their heinous participation in the drug trade. They are not pushing forward, and are instead diverting, the direction of the fight against drugs and sabotaging the good intentions of the campaign,” she added.In an interview with the Inquirer, De Lima said the witnesses would include relatives of some of those killed in police operations.“They (the PNP) should admit that there are scalawags in the institution, and our witnesses will be able to say that there are scalawags in the institution,” said De Lima, a former justice secretary and a former chair of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).Emerging theoryOne of the “strong” emerging theories, she said, was that police officers involved in drugs were themselves cleaning out those who could spill their dirt, possibly through hiring vigilantes.“It’s a very strong theory based on what we have,” she said.She said her committee had already started sending summons to resource persons for the inquiry, among them PNP Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa.“I really want them to listen to our witnesses, if they have not investigated these cases,” De Lima said.She said she chose to hear the witnesses first in the inquiry “to set the right tone.”“These are the families, the loved ones of the victims. They’re the ones directly affected,” she said.The witnesses are under the care and protection of the CHR, she said.De Lima has so far scheduled hearings for Aug. 22 and 23, but expects that more hearing dates would be needed.Against bad eggs“Some of my colleagues (in the Senate) are of the assumption that the PNP can do no wrong as an institution. But I’m against the bad eggs of the institution, against the scalawags,” De Lima told Inquirer editors and reporters in a roundtable interview on Monday.She said she felt “undercurrents” of efforts to stop her inquiry, including requirements that her committee first “produce complaints and evidence.”“But I’m not a court of law. This is just an inquiry, and therefore the technical rules of evidence do not apply. Why all of a sudden in all the inquiries all these years they are imposing so many requirements?” De Lima said.Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano, Mr. Duterte’s defeated running mate in the May elections, had earlier made his opposition to the inquiry explicit, saying it was a premature indictment of the entire PNP.More than 700 deaths related to the drug war have been recorded since Mr. Duterte took office—a figure that has drawn calls from the international community for the new administration to respect human rights.The President has himself several times threatened to “kill” drug traders if they continued to destroy the country.‘Root and extent’De Lima, who had earlier vowed to serve as the “fiscalizer” of the Duterte administration, said in her letter that her inquiry was no different from the President’s “search for the root and extent” of the criminal trade.“In ferreting out the truth, our goal is to ensure the success of the campaign against drugs and crime and in drafting the right laws and guidelines to help our law enforcers in the proper conduct of their duties,” she said.During the last years of the Aquino administration, the drug problem escalated, affecting 99 percent of barangays in Metro Manila and 26 percent nationwide, according to the 2015 annual report of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.",1

"Two Senate committees have warned President Rodrigo Duterte against “micromanaging” the Philippine National Police (PNP) after his move to recall a relief order on a group of Leyte policemen allegedly resulted in the officers killing Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. of Albuera, Leyte province, in November last year, purportedly to cover up their involvement in illegal drug activities.The committee on public order and dangerous drugs, led by Sen. Panfilo Lacson, and the committee on justice and human rights, led by Sen. Richard Gordon, said Supt. Marvin Marcos and his men from the Criminal Investigative and Detection Group-Region 8 (CIDG-8) “could have been prevented from doing their dastardly deed” had they been relieved a month before they “silenced” Espinosa.But the two panels stated that the Oct. 15, 2016, relief order issued by PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa on Marcos and his men was rescinded that same day by Mr. Duterte.Espinosa and another inmate, Raul Yap, were shot dead allegedly by Marcos’ men inside the Baybay City subprovincial jail in a predawn operation on Nov. 5, 2016.Confessed drug distributor Kerwin Espinosa, the mayor’s son, had testified in the Senate that some members of Marcos’ raiding team had been under his payroll.“The committees are of the opinion that the President should not be micromanaging the affairs of the government and should place his trust in the sound discretion of all his appointees, including PNP Chief Dela Rosa,” they said in a 34-page report to the Senate on March 7 for plenary approval. The report was later posted on the Senate website.The report said Marcos and his men were involved in the “premeditated” killing of Mayor Espinosa and were guilty of abuse of authority.The committees said Dela Rosa should be given “full authority and control on how he will manage the day-to-day affairs of the organization.”Free hand“He should be given a free hand to decide on how to run the PNP and his decisions should be recognized and respected and should be countermanded or reversed only by the Chief Executive in case of a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion,” the report said.“The committees strongly condemn the killing of Mayor Rolando Espinosa and Raul Yap. Though they have committed violations of our existing laws, the same is to be determined by our courts. Granting that certain freedoms are denied to detainees, including their right to privacy, they are still entitled to the fundamental right to life as guaranteed by the Constitution,” it said.The committees said Espinosa was silenced by “individuals who wanted their participation concealed” and that they happened to have access and means to kill Espinosa “through abuse of their authority.”“They thought they could do away with Espinosa by feigning a legitimate operation,” they said.The senators noted the use of “overwhelming force” by authorities serving the search warrants on Espinosa and Yap on that day, with Marcos bringing in 18 CIDG men and six members of the Regional Maritime Unit as “perimeter defense.”They rejected the explanation of Marcos that they needed such force, noting that Marcos did not even inform his superiors, Region 8 director Chief Supt. Elmer Beltejar and CIDG Director Roel Obusan, about the raid on the cells of Espinosa and Yap.The committees also found it “peculiar” that aside from the CIDG men, “nobody was able to witness what transpired in Cells 1 and 7.”Guards disarmedThey found “appalling” that jail guards and police personnel tasked with ensuring Espinosa’s safety were “disarmed and made to kneel down and face the wall” by the CIDG men during their raid.“That fact alone merits strong denouncement and condemnation as it disrespects and disregards the authority of the jail guards and police officers present, who are supposed to be accorded with respect as fellow public servants,” the report said.The committees also did not give credence to the deposition of Paul Olendan, whom the CIDG men said was their informant, that Mayor Espinosa had drugs and firearms in his cell.Olendan was on his workplace at the time he was supposed to be inside the Baybay jail, which was 100 km away. Olendan had gone missing when the Senate started its hearings on Espinosa’s killing.The senators said they were convinced that Espinosa and Yap had no firearms and illegal drugs in their possession.They noted that a few days before the raid, a thorough search of the cells was done and guards only found cell phones and chargers in Espinosa’s possession.Not only did they plant evidence at the cells of Mayor Espinosa and Yap, but Marcos and his men also took the hard drive of the CCTV cameras in the jail, according to the report, pointing out that jail guards had attested that the cameras were functioning on the day of the raid.Overwhelming evidenceThe report said that Kerwin Espinosa had stated during the Senate hearing that Chief Insp. Leo Laraga (who shot Rolando Espinosa) and Supt. Santi Noel Matira had been on his payroll.It said this “gives sense to all that has happened and explains why Espinosa was murdered.”The committees urged the Department of Justice to expedite its preliminary investigation of Espinosa’s killing since a multiple murder complaint was filed against Marcos and his men by the National Bureau of Investigation as early as Dec. 7, 2016.“Considering the time, not to mention the overwhelming testimonial and documentary evidence presented before the five-man panel conducting the preliminary investigation, they should have already resolved this matter with urgency,” the report said.The committees also asked the Supreme Court to expedite its determination “as to the propriety and liabilities or sanctions, if any” of Judge Carlos Arguelles (for failing to act on Mayor Espinosa’s motion to be transferred to a safer facility); Judge Arcelo Sabarre Jr., of RTC Branch 30 Basey, Samar, and Judge Janet Cabalona of RTC Branch 33 Basey, Samar, (for issuing search warrants upon persons detained in a government detention facility outside and his and her courts’ jurisdiction.)",1

"President Rodrigo Duterte has had enough with the students from the University of the Philippines who chose to ‘walkout’ of their classes than to study.He warned that he would replace the students who joined the ‘walkout’ protest against the current government and urged the people to overthrow him with Lumads who wanted a good education.WALKOUT NA! Join the hundreds of students who have already walked out their classes as we move to overthrow the US-Duterte regime! #EndStateFascism #NoToMartialLaw #OverthrowDuterte pic.twitter.com/IA61bNLZix — STAND UP (@standupdiliman) February 1, 2018In a speech at the indigenous people’s summit in Davao City, President Rodrigo Duterte said that he would give the slots of the student rallyists to the bright lumads who didn’t have the opportunity or funds to study in a prestigious school like University of the Philippines.Lumads are the indigenous people in Mindanao who had lack of access in good education.9 out of 10 Lumad children have no access to education, however 233 alternative schools were provided to give education to them.“Etong mga U.P students na ito na laging nag wo-walkout, kanina nag walkout nanaman sila. Okay, doon sa mga ayaw pumasok sa eskwela, umalis kayo diyan dahil ipapalit ko sa inyo ang mga bright lumads. Tulungan ko silang makapag enroll diyan sa U.P. Madaming Filipino ang gusto ng magandang edukasyon,” President Duterte said.“So sa mga mga pinagpapatuloy ang pag po-protesta, wag kayong mag walkout sa room niyo. Bibigyan ko kayo ng pribilehiyo, wag na kayong pumasok sa eskwela ng isang taon dahil ipapasok ko diyan yung mga Filipino na gusto ng magandang edukasyon. Libre diyan,” he added.Instead of wasting their time in school, President Rodrigo Duterte urged the student activists to stay in the streets and gave chance to the Filipinos who really wanted to study in U.P than to be busy in joining demonstrations against the government.“Diyan nalang kayo sa kalye. Go ahead! Dahil kukuha ako ng mga bago (estudyante), ilalagay ko sila diyan. Pera naman yan ng bayan,” Duterte said.Some students from UP-Diliman walked out of their classes as protest against the policies of the government including Martial Law in Mindanao, War against illegal drugs and Federalism.They called President Rodrigo Duterte a ‘fascist’ and ‘dictator’“In this part of Philippine history, we no longer fear the looming dictatorship of the US-Duterte regime–for it is already happening today. In this time of oppression, silence is akin to allegiance to the oppressors. Tomorrow, we walk out from our classes and we will topple this dictatorship!” UP Office of the Student Regent Facebook page said in their post, one day before the protest.U.P Students also labeled the current government as “Duterte-US regime.” despite of the fact that the current President criticized the longest ally of the Philippines several times and keep praising China and Russia.“Dapat Duterte-Russia-China regime,” one netizen told the activists on Facebook.On February 23, Anakbayan urged the people to join the ‘Pambansang Walkout laban sa pahirap at pasistang diktadurang US-Duterte’.The University of the Philippines has the highest financial endowment of all educational institutions in the Philippines.UP students are known for being critic against the government and leading demonstrations to oppose the policies that they don’t like.That is why critics stereotyped the University of the Philippines as a ‘training grounds for the communists rebels’.Organizers of the said protest is not yet commenting on the statement of President Duterte.",0
"An election watchdog on Saturday denounced the move of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to release supposedly unused vote counting machines (VCMs) to Smartmatic, arguing that the move violates the Protective Protection Order (PPO) of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) on the pending election protest of former senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.Glenn Chong, convener of the Consortium for Clean and Credible Elections and vice chairman of Reform Philippines Coalition, branded as highly suspicious the decision of the Comelec to agree to the recall of 1,356 VCMs which were allegedly not “deployed and/or used” during the elections, since it is being made amid an election contest involving the vice presidential race.“Deployed and/or used connote two things – deployment to the municipalities and deployment to the precincts in cases where the VCMs actually malfunctioned. On the first, if they were not deployed to the municipalities at all, then it is a violation of the protocol which provides that there should be reserved VCMs on standby in every municipality,” Chong said.“If that is the case, the Comelec should be held liable for wasting almost 100 million of the people’s money on machines that they did not intend to use in the first place. On the second, if they were deployed to the municipalities but were not deployed to the precincts, then they are still covered by the PPO since there was in fact a deployment and Comelec has no business agreeing to their recall,” he added.Earlier, the Supreme Court ordered the Comelec to preserve and safeguard the integrity of all ballot boxes, their contents, VCMs and all other election-related paraphernalia – including the automated election equipment and records – in all 92,509 clustered precincts used in the May polls.Chong said he got hold of a letter dated September 27, 2016 by Comelec Commissioner Christian Robert Lim to PET chairperson, Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno, informing her of the poll body’s decision to grant the request of Smartmatic to release the 1,356 VCMs beginning October 26, 2016.Lim said the VCMs were not deployed and/or used during the elections. Hence, they are considered not covered by the PPO.“It bears to emphasize that since the units were not actually deployed and/or used during the said elections, the Commission considers the same as not within the scope of the Precautionary Protective Order (PPO) issued by the Honorable Tribunal. Accordingly, the Commission intends to begin releasing the said VCMs on 26 October 2016,” Lim told Sereno.Accordingly, the Comelec, through Executive Director Jose Tolentino Jr., has invited the parties in the election protest involving the vice presidency to a briefing on the release of the VCMs on October 19, 2016 at 10 a.m. at the JAM Liner warehouse in Santa Rosa, Laguna.Tolentino’s letter, however, failed to mention whether the machines will be opened for inspection.But Chong said given the highly irregular actions of the Comelec in the conduct of the elections, such move is dubious.“Comelec, being a serial violator of our election laws, has been committing highly illegal acts from the beginning. Since 2010, it allowed Smartmatic to get away with at least eighteen blatant violations of its contract. Before the elections, it adamantly refused our request for an inventory of all machines as a guarantee of the integrity of the elections. Then on the day of elections, there was the ‘cosmetic script’ change in the Transparency server during the transmission of votes,” the lawyer said.“It refused all requests to subject the system to a platform and system audit by third party IT experts. Then there was its plan to strip the data from the VCMs despite the issuance of the PPO. Now, they want to give the VCMs to Smartmatic without even subjecting it to inspection. This is too much,” he added.“The syndicate is at play again and this is another attempt to hide the truth,” Chong said.He challenged the Comelec to subject the machines to a thorough inspection by IT experts before their release to ensure that they indeed were not deployed or were not used in any way during the last elections.“If the Comelec has nothing to hide, then they should open the VCMs for a thorough inspection. We should not let them get away with it again. Their nefarious plans should be stopped,” he said.",1
"Two senators on Friday sought an investigation of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II’s purported grant of special privileges to inmates in exchange for testifying against Sen. Leila de Lima at a House of Representatives’ drug inquiry.They noted that the allegations could compromise Aguirre’s credibility as chief of an office that demands fairness and probity.Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian said Malacañang or even the Senate should initiate an investigation of Aguirre’s supposed instruction to jail guards to give high-profile convicts access to communication equipment and special amenities while held at a military jail.“This should be independently investigated by the Office of the President or the Senate. The [office of the] DOJ [Department of Justice] secretary is a very powerful position,” Gatchalian said. “Allegations of undue biases and manipulation can definitely erode its credibility to dispense justice.”De Lima backed the call and urged the administration to end its alleged “deceptions and hypocrisies.” President Duterte, Aguirre and other allies are among those who had tagged De Lima in the drug trade, claiming she took drug money to support her senatorial bid.“This yet again another scandal in this administration should be seriously and thoroughly investigated,” she said.A Dec. 9, 2016, confidential memorandum of the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) showed that a military investigation busted the inmates’ access to mobile phones and internet connection, and use of smart television sets and air-conditioning units.The Armed Forces of the Philippines agreed to hold eight convicts at its custodial facility in Camp Aguinaldo in September at the height of the congressional hearings against De Lima, but set guidelines barring the entry of contraband, including communication devices.The memo, sent by BuCor Legal Office Chief Alvin Herrera Lim to BuCor Director General Benjamin delos Santos, recounted a meeting among the AFP, the BuCor and the Philippine National Police, which was tasked to secure the inmates.Citing the AFP investigation, the memo said “elements of both the PNP and BuCor invoked that they are just following the express instruction of the Hon. Vitaliano Aguirre II to allow the entry of the above-enumerated gadgets in return for the testimony they gave during the congressional inquiry on the proliferation of drugs inside New Bilibid Prison.”Delos Santos forwarded the document to Aguirre himself on Dec. 16, without any alterations or notations on Lim’s memo, as shown in a separate document.But Aguirre on Thursday denied giving such privileges and said the Inquirer report quoting the document was wrong. However, he said he had ordered BuCor officials to inspect the AFP facility and seize contraband if they find any.De Lima cited how Aguirre and other officials involved in making such concession with the inmates may have “concealed or suppressed” the documents as they are “very sensitive as they are explosive.”She noted that neither Aguirre nor Delos Santos had denied the existence of the documents.“Aguirre should answer the question: Did his office receive these documents? If so, what did he do, if any? Why did he order an investigation into the contraband just now? Those documents speak for themselves,” De Lima said.The senator said the documents just showed how the administration was pulling out all the stops just to pin her down on drug charges. Aguirre said earlier this week that state prosecutors were close to resolving drug complaints against De Lima. The senator acknowledged that her arrest might be imminent.“So who are now the real protectors and coddlers of drug convicts, drug lords?” De Lima said.“As I’ve been saying, the President and his men will do anything and everything just to destroy me, including sleeping with the enemies. Their end game is not really war on drugs but war on De Lima! What a bunch of hypocrites! It’s a sham war on drugs!” she added.De Lima has several times denied drug allegations against her, saying it was part to taint her name for publicly opposing the President’s controversial policies, including the bloody war on drugs.On Thursday, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV called on the Commission on Appointments (CA) to block Aguirre’s nomination to his post, as he is set to face the body again on Feb. 15. Trillanes, also a fierce administration critic, had opposed Aguirre’s nomination last week, causing his appointment to be deferred.Sen. Joel Villanueva said Aguirre should “explain it [the incident] and convince every member of the CA that he deserves to be confirmed as the secretary of justice.” He said the opposition of just one member was enough to cause the deferment or rejection of his confirmation.",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte’s vaunted social media machine has achieved such a reputation that even Singapore’s biggest newspaper, the Straits Times, has taken notice.In an opinion piece over the weekend, Straits Times Global Affairs associate editor Ravi Velloor nailed it on the head how die-hard Duterte supporters have successfully changed the dynamics of criticizing the president.“Criticism is met with abuse. An army of online warriors, some of whom are perhaps employed in the booming outsourcing industry, seem to be readily on hand to troll presidential critics, putting a fright into even seasoned commentators,” it read.Velloor was writing in the context of the Duterte administration’s bloody anti-illegal drug war, which in the past three months has claimed 1,840 lives.“People with no links to the drug trade, either as consumers or suppliers, have been assassinated in the process, perhaps to settle private vendettas,” the opinion piece noted.The write up had more sharp things to say about Duterte though, and the current state of affairs in the Philippines in general.“The Duterte-ordered extrajudicial killings, and his gyrations on the maritime dispute with China, have raised a stench for the Philippines that is far more perverse than the haze that used to spread out from Indonesia. If it goes on for too long, it could potentially be a bone in ASEAN’s throat,” it said.",0
"“Until the very end.” That’s how long petitioners are willing to fight for a reversal of the Supreme Court decision allowing the burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.Former Akbyan Rep. Barry Gutierrez, who also serves as lawyer for a group of petitioners, stressed this point on Wednesday before thousands of protesters at the People Power Monument just outside Camp Aguinaldo on Quezon City.“Umaasa tayo na yung siyam na bumoto na payagan ay sana naman kahit konti magbago ang isip nila,” he said. “Pakinggan naman nila ang sinisigaw ng kasaysayan at muling harapin ang katotohanan, ang ating konstitusyon at mahigit 30 desisyon ng Supreme Court na sinasabing si Marcos ay hindi bayani.”(“We are hoping that the nine who voted to allow the burial would somehow change their minds. May they listen to what history cries for and may they again face the truth, our Constitution, and the more than 30 Supreme Court rulings saying that Marcos was not a hero.”)Under secrecy, the Marcoses were able to have the late president buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani on Nov. 18. And yet, the Supreme Court decision was not supposed to be final and executory until 15 days after its announcement on Nov. 8.The burial has since sparked a series of protests.At Wednesday’s protest, Gutierrez urged the Supreme Court to review a motion of reconsideration filed before it seeking void its ruling that upheld the order of President Rodrigo Duterte’s to let Marcos be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.“Ang hinihingi namin: Balikan niyo inyong desisyon. Muling aralin, muling tignan ang argumento. At sa huli, kung magbago inyong isip, anong hinihiling natin?” Gutierrez said.(“What we’re asking for is this: Review your decision. Study it and look at the arguments again. And in the end, if you should change your mind, consider what we’re asking for.”)The crowd, composed mostly of millennials, responded with a resounding “Hukayin! (Exhume).”At one point, they also chanted “Baba ni Imee, panghukay!” – referring to the eldest daughter of the late president.“Hindi naman natin hinihingi dahil gusto natin maging mapaghiganti. Pero sino ba ang nagpumilit na magkaroon ng madaliang paglilibing? Sino ba ang hindi naghintay na maging final ang decision? Sila mismo ang lumabag sa batas, bumastos sa Supreme Court at patago at panakaw na iilibing si Marcos,” Gutierrez said as the crowd cheered.(“We’re not asking for a reversal of the decision because we want revenge. But who insisted on having a quick burial? Who couldn’t wait for the decision to become final? They were the ones who broke the law, who disrespected the Supreme Court, and buried Marcos on the sly.”)Among those present at the People Power Monument gathering were Cabinet members of the Aquino administration – former Justice Secretary Leila de Lima (who’s now a senator), former Interior Secretary Manuel “Mar” Roxas, former Education Secretary Armin Luistro, former Communications Undersecretary Manolo Quezon, and former Social Welfare Secretary Corazon “Dinky” Soliman.Other personalities who attended were Maria Serena Diokno (who had just resigned as head of National Historical Commission of the Philippines) , Economics professor Solita Collas-Monsod, anti-crime advocate Teresita Ang-See, and former Sen. Wigberto Tañada.Also sighted in the crowd were actors Pen Medina with his son Ping, Mitch Valdez, and Saab Magalona. There were also musicians Noel Cabangon and Jim Paredes and the The Cheats and Moonstar 88.The crowd, which organizers placed at 15,000, looked much bigger than the attendance at a similar gathering last Friday. But the Quezon City Police District gave a crowd estimate of only 3,000.",1
"We, the undersigned Faculty Members of the De La Salle University, acting individually, and with reasoned conviction, cognizant of our role in society as champions of enlightenment and in pursuit of our mission to create a haven for critical Christian thinkers committed to serve society, particularly the poor, assert that:? The right to life is a fundamental Christian tenet that finds full meaning when combined with the inherent rights of humans to a decent, safe, and productive existence as well as to an all-round development. Thus, beyond protecting the very important right of the unborn, it must extend to a recognition that a life that is weighed down by poverty, sickness, and social inequality–now compounded by environmental stresses–deprives humans of agency to transform themselves and the world for the common good.? A key dimension of the democratic ideal at the core of our community and country is the promotion of pluralism and diversity. In a society marred by great imbalances of power and wealth, the freedom that comes with choice has become a privilege. Empowering the poor and the marginalized, women in particular, requires opening up opportunities for their self-actualization. In this modern day, it is alarming that death from childbirth continues to claim 4,500 women every year or about 12 every day. Lack of access to quality and affordable reproductive health services and timely information as much as poverty has kept many women from finding their own voice, exercising their basic rights, and taking their place as full members of society.? The current population level, ranged against the level of our physical, environmental, and natural resources, is only one–albeit important–factor to the worsening quality of life of Filipinos. While our population growth rate has declined somewhat below the two percent threshold, it is still higher relative to the increase in the incomes of families in the 7th to the 10th decile groups–the segment of the population with the highest proportion of those living in absolute poverty as well. Here, among these groups, the quality of life is severely compromised due to an increase in population.? Part of a meaningful celebration of life itself is the affirmation of the inherent moral standing of every human being, who has the capacity to make reasoned decisions, guided both by moral and ethical considerations, as well as by scientific truths and conventions. The ability to make moral judgments, however, requires knowledge and information, and for those living in materially constrained circumstances, requires further support from the society. The capacity to provide that support now rests with the State and its instrumentalities.Our belief in the above mentioned premises leads us to express support for the Reproductive Health Bill in both houses of Congress as a much needed step toward the attainment of a just and democratic society which celebrates life at its fullest range and quality. Our support for the RH Bill is grounded on the following convictions:? Enacting the RH Bill into law would strengthen the capacity of the State to assist women and their partners to make informed choices, thereby helping them to become healthy and responsible parents and attain a life of quality for themselves and their families. This is achieved by providing women and their partners, particularly the poor, with information and other forms of reproductive health support, including safe and affordable methods that do not violate the Constitutional provision declaring as illegal abortion and, by implication, the sale and promotion of abortifacient birth control technologies.? The passage of the Bill, and with the active participation of parents and the guidance of the educational and moral leaders of society, will help provide the youth with access to age-appropriate knowledge and information that would equip them to make decisions that would prevent them from having early and premarital sex, unwanted and teen pregnancies, and abortions, and help them become healthy and responsible parents in the future.? The RH Bill is not a panacea to solve the problem of poverty; it is a vital component of the complex set of interventions that all sectors of society, not only the State, should undertake to promote and make successful.? The RH Bill provides only options for individual citizens, and does not contain coercive or punitive mechanisms to compel or penalize persons to act against their own religious beliefs, moral and ethical convictions, and cultural sensibilities. For example, and to respect the religious rights of individuals, a health worker cannot be compelled by the state to disseminate artificial contraceptives, or parents may pull their children out of sex education classes.? The Bill would ensure the allocation of public funds to finance what appear to be personal and individual concerns such as the number and spacing of children a couple should have, or the health and well-being of individuals on issues that may not be seen in the ordinary sense as public health risks. This is consistent with the Christian value of empathy and social responsibility, and of shared commitment to the promotion of a quality of life where a healthy balance between population and its physical environment is achieved that would help ease the burden on our collective social fabric and limited resources.It is for these reasons that we are confident that we are affirming our commitment to a life with quality when we set our signatures herein.Signatories to the Statement As of September 3, 2012NAME OF FACULTY MEMBERS DEPARTMENT/COLLEGE1.

"It was not only for her communist links and past that Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo found herself doing some explaining before the Commission on Appointments (CA) on Wednesday.Taguiwalo was asked by Senate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto III why she had two children but her status was single as indicated in her personal information.“Just on the lighter side, Senator (Franklin) Drilon and I were looking at the personal information about you and you have two children, daughters or sons? But you’re single?” Sotto asked Taguiwalo on her first appearance before the CA labor, employment and social welfare committee.The secretary said she had two daughters.“OK. My life has never been a normal one. I’ve never had a whole mother-father-children kind of thing except when I was growing up in Bacolod,” she said.Underground lifeShe said she graduated from the University of the Philippines in 1970 and from 1972 to 1986 “it had been a life underground or in prison.”“So, my story would be different from the stories of those who have gone through, corporation, etc.,” she said.“In the street language, when you have children and you are single, ang tawag lang ay na-ano lang. Thank you, you have my 100-percent support, Madam Secretary,” Sotto said.Social mediaBut Taguiwalo had a rejoinder for Sotto. “Senator Sotto, I teach women’s studies in UP so we respect all kinds of families and that includes solo parents. Thank you,” she said.After netizens protested on social media Sotto’s exchange with Taguiwalo, the senator apologized to those who may have been offended.A joke Sotto, a comedian-turned-politician, said that he meant his statement to be a joke and that “almost everybody laughed.”Taguiwalo defended her student activist days and her membership in the Communist Party of the Philippines upon questioning by Sen. Panfilo Lacson and Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon.‘Tricky’ questionShe told Lacson he asked her a “tricky” question when the senator asked whether she had renounced violence as a means to show dissent against the duly constituted authority.“As a member of the Cabinet of President Duterte, I renounce violence as it is. I am willing to work with him so we can put an end to armed conflict that has beset our country for many decades,” she said.Hearings suspendedLacson said he would support Taguiwalo’s confirmation.Confirmation hearings were suspended by the committee after more CA members said they wanted to subject her to questioning.Taguiwalo told reporters that she expected that she would be grilled about her past, especially since she was nominated by the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) to the Cabinet.“My boss now is the President. They (NDFP) nominated me but I’m not their appointee. I am the President’s appointee,” she said.",1
"While Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte may have drawn some parallel between himself and Adolf Hitler, Senator Leila De Lima, former Justice Secretary under the Aquino administration, has likened herself to Harry Potter, that fictional darling of awizard created by author J.K. Rowling.The lady senator made this comparison in a recent speech.She has been linked to illegal drug trade inside the New Bilibid Prison (National Penitentiary) during her tenure with the Justice Department. She has denied these allegations.The Adobo Chronicles convened its top editors and writers to try to decipher what De Lima meant when she compared herself to Potter.We couldn’t find any parallel except that De Lima and Potter both wore neck scarves. And stylish eyeglasses.",0
"Widespread flooding in Thailand’s south has killed 21 people, hit rubber production in the region and shut down infrastructure, officials said on Monday, as the military government increased aid to flood-affected areas.Thailand’s wet season usually ends in late November and heavy rain and flooding are rare in January. Unseasonably heavy rain has hit 12 out of 67 provinces, officials said.“We have sent soldiers, police and the Ministry of the Interior to ease the situation,” Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters.The death toll from the floods stood at 21 on Monday with more than 330,000 households affected, according to the Department Disaster Prevention and Mitigation.The department said that the main airport in the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat would remain shut for the foreseeable future. A rail route from the Thai capital Bangkok to Nakhon Si Thammarat has also been suspended.Southern Thailand is a major rubber-producing area and the floods have come at a particularly bad time for farmers, said Uthai Sonlucksub, president of the Natural Rubber Council of Thailand.“This is the worst impact we have had in the area in 10 years. The floods are very heavy. The problem is this year we’ve seen both drought and flooding so it has been disastrous for rubber farmers,” Uthai told Reuters.Uthai said that rubber prices would increase this year because demand is set to exceed supply.“I’ve had orders from China but we aren’t even sure if we can meet these orders because of the havoc the floods have caused,” he said.“If they buy, it’ll be at higher-than-expected prices.”Widespread floods in 2011 killed more than 900 people and caused major disruption to industry, cutting economic growth that year to just 0.1 percent.",1
"can’t count in Roman numerals.There was only one multiple-choice question on the second part of the survey: “Which of the following Arabic numerals correspond to the Roman numerals XLVIII ?” The choices were 28, 38, 48, 58 , 68, and “none of the above.”Thirty percent of respondents answered 28; twenty five percent answered 38; fifteen percent answered 68, and ten percent answered 58. Only 5% answered 48 which was the correct answer. The remaining fifteen percent answered “none of the above” because they didn’t know that the numbers 0123456789 were called “Arabic”numerals. They thought that Arabic numerals referred to the special characters used in Yemen and the rest of the Arab world.Upon learning of the poll results, the National Football League board of governors met in an emergency session to unanimously approve a resolution to change next year’s official Super Bowl name to “Super Bowl 49.”",0
"The Supreme Court (SC) has set a new schedule on the oral arguments on a petition filed seeking the nullification of the Philippine’s withdrawal from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).In its Twitter account, the SC said arguments will be heard on August 28 instead of August 14.The petitions were filed by Senators Francis Pangilinan, Franklin Drilon, Paolo Benigno Aquino 4th, Risa Hontiveros and Antonio Trillanes 4th, and the Philippine Coalition for the International Criminal Court (PCICC).Named respondents were Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, UN Ambassador Teodoro Locsin Jr. and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo.The two petitions argued that the withdrawal violates the 1987 Constitution.The PCICC said the Executive Department cannot invalidate the treaty since it can only be voided by the Senate or the Supreme Court.“Entering into a treaty or international agreement requires participation of Congress, that is, through concurrence of at least 2/3 of all the members of the Senate,” the senators said.The ICC has heavily criticized the Duterte administration’s drug campaign.In March, Locsin officially served notice to the UN through a one-page note verbale the government’s decision to withdraw from the Rome Statute.",1
"Before the 9thAfter the 9thThe InterviewNot for MalacañangI woke up from general anesthesia at 4:00 PM of 09 May 2016. At last, my trusty surgeon finally excised a severe perineal infection that’s been bugging me for weeks. I should have undergone surgery weeks earlier but I chose to postpone it because I had something more important to do.Well, that’s what you get from sitting in front of a PC for 17 hours a day for three straight months. But it’s not like I had any other choice. Big Media was ganging up on my bet, and the least I can do is provide information that The Establishment deliberately ignores.There are lots of people out there who are way smarter than I am. Too bad they’re not on my side.In a desperate bid to bring the frontrunner down, a noisy senator suddenly came up with an exposé , alleging Duterte amassed billions’ worth of ill-gotten wealth. Overnight, hungry wolves from the yellow, orange, and (sky?) blue camps dove in for the kill . Some supporters started doubting him: with such a shocking revelation, who wouldn’t be rattled?I saw major loopholes in what little evidence Trillanes provided. I saw that it was problematic at best , totally fabricated at worst . I had it all in my head and I had to tell everyone about it, but explaining it would take time.I requested my doctor to postpone the surgery and prescribe painkillers for the meantime. And there I was, writing #BangkoSerye , hoping against all hope the people will listen to what I had to say. The pain killers barely worked, and I was writhing in pain almost every other minute, while I faced a real risk of death from septic shock After crusading for almost half a year to get votes for my “manok”, there I was on a hospital bed, unable to vote. I just tried to find solace in the hope that I was able to sway even a few thousand of the five million who got to read my blog that month.Evening of Election Day, I grabbed the remote control and turned the TV on. I saw Duterte leading by a mile. I heaved a gigantic sigh of relief.I told myself, “TP, you’ve done your job. You’ve helped this country. It’s time to get some rest.” After spending tons of money, enduring countless sleepless nights, and suffering heaps of insults from my peers, I felt that at last, I can leave my blog and move on with my private life.But it didn’t happen. There were just too many issues that I cannot ignore: the Hash Code scandal , the tardy SOCEs , the Senate Presidency bitch fight , the shady 700 MHz deal , the list goes on and on.Then an idea struck me: Why not work in Malacañang?With more resources at my disposal plus the extra street cred , I felt that I can do more for this country compared to remaining as a pseudo-anonymous blogger. So I gave it a shot. I submitted my resume to several incoming Malacañang officials. Luckily, one of them noticed me (Secretary X) and his assistant (Secretary Y) invited me for meeting with Secretary X.It was 22 June 2016, I arrived at the designated meeting place five minutes ahead of schedule. That’s just about right. Unfortunately, both Secretary X and Secretary Y were in a very important meeting so he they had to let another assistant, Secretary Z, interview me instead.I am not some self-important bastard. I understand that their meeting is more important that my application. It’s okay.Secretary Z and I sat down, and the interview commenced.As I sat on my chair, I told myself, “Okay, this is it. Kick ass, TP!”Secretary Z asked the first question and I started to answer.As I was in the middle of the sentence, I noticed his eyes started to wander towards someone at my back, which turned out to be a group of presumably Malacañan people. I didn’t take offense, as his courtesy to his colleagues is a good thing.He, however, did this several more times, but nobody was around us anymore, suggesting that I am saying something really idiotic, or he’s plain uninterested in this applicant. But I still gave him the benefit of the doubt. I told myself, “Maybe he’s just stressed out with the inauguration and all that.”Then he asked me, ""Tell me, what can you do for us?""That is the last thing any self-respecting job interviewer should ask because it is not only condescending but also reflective of the interviewer's ineptitude.Secretary Z, the answer to that is in my Curriculum Vitae, the same thing you should have read before this damn thing started.But I kept my cool, and provided the answer he expected.By the end of the interview, Secretary Z still hasn’t given me his full name, so I felt the need to ask.I said, “What’s your name?”Secretary Z simply smiled. He refused to answer.Secretary Z deems that I, a mere earthling, wasn’t worthy to know the poetry that is his name.I am ThinkingPinoy, one of the best dirt diggers in the country today. Luckily for some camps, I am not the vindictive type. Because if I were, then I would have battered a veteran journalist with Magdalo links to a point where she would have said goodbye to her illustrious decades-long career.True enough, I went online and found everything about him in a span of one hour.I personally have nothing to gain and a lot to lose if I work in Malacañang. For the next six years, I will be paid less than half of what I normally get. For the next six years, I will have to live separately from my partner because the salary wouldn’t even cover taxi fare. For the next six years, I will be inside the snake pit that is Philippine Government.Juxtapose that to the quiet, peaceful, private life I had before ThinkingPinoy. The same thing I wanted to have after May 11th. But I told myself, “Screw personal interests. I love my country.”But then, that fateful interview brought me to a realization, a realization that some Duterte supporters, after the unlikely win, have become intoxicated with power. Take Secretary Z, for example. He is just an assistant of an assistant of an assistant secretary, yet he believes his position to be so important that even his name should be considered classified information.Despite being flabbergasted by Secretary Z’s arrogance, I am confident that most people in the incoming Duterte administration have a sincere concern for the common people.Nevertheless, I felt that it’s better if I remained to be an outsider with independent views and opinions. I felt that more than just elucidating complex issues for the benefit of the common tao, I should also use this platform to criticize the Duterte administration whenever necessary. And that includes officials who feel a sense of entitlement, the same kind of people that Duterte himself detests.That is something I cannot do if I work in Malacañang, as it would be a classic case of conflict of interest.After all, even if I support our new president, my loyalty is reserved solely for my countrymen. It just so happens that the interests of my countrymen align with his, for now.I need to stay outside Malacañang so I can still criticize those inside it.And for a second, I wondered, ""Is Secretary Z's 'assholery' attributable to Rappler's grudge against me? (See below)""Regardless, I will not reveal Secretary Z's name. I want him to have the opportunity to change for the better, for this country's sake.But Secretary Z, please remember that you are a public servant.Now, I suggest you start acting like one. ( ThinkingPinoy Did you like this post? Help ThinkingPinoy stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help!",0
"The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed senior government officials to answer the petition of a group of parents who wanted the Department of Health (DOH) to provide free medical services to children inoculated with the Dengvaxia vaccine.In a press briefing, high court spokesperson Theodore Te said the tribunal gave the government officials 10 days to comment on the petition.Impleaded in the petition were Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, Education Secretary Leonor Briones, interior department officer in charge Catalino Cuy, Dr. Lyndon Lee Suy of the DOH National Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and Food and Drug Administration chief Nela Charade Puno.The petitioners, composed of more than 70 parents whose children were vaccinated with Dengvaxia, raised the health risks posed by the dengue vaccine as disclosed by its manufacturer, French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur.“These free medical services shall continue until it would have been determined and declared by competent and medical and/or scientific experts that the threat/s brought about by the Dengvaxia vaccine have been minimized or eliminated,” the petitioners said.",1
"Be on the lookout for “new neighbors” this time of year, the Philippine National Police reminds banks, pawnshops and money remittance centers.It’s usually right before a long vacation, like Holy Week when members of “Daga-Daga Gang” or “Acetylene Gang” move near pawnshops and banks so they could start burrowing their way into the vaults and get the cash, according to the PNP.“Their favorite targets are jewelry shops, banks, pawnshops, and money lending and remittance centers,” said the PNP spokesperson, Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos.“The people in these establishments should check those around them as early as now,” Carlos said.“Has someone moved in recently? Are there new faces around? Check also your drainage system. Do a 360-degree inspection of your establishment because it is during these long weekend (vacations) that these tunnel rats do their digging,” he added.Carlos said local police mobile units and police foot patrols would do their rounds to check if these establishments had been broken into by the Daga-Daga Gang.“We will do this especially from Holy Wednesday until Easter Sunday. We will also deploy them in the villages and subdivisions to check on the houses,” he said.",1
"the Ice Bucket Challenge to benefit the ALS Association. It was a campaign that went viral worldwide, raising hundreds of millions of dollars for ALS research.As Americans begin to file their 2014 income tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced a ruling that only 80% of donations to the Ice Bucket Challenge is tax-deductible. The remaining 20% will be used by state governments to make up for all the water that went to waste as a result of the ice bucket challenge campaign.In California, which continues to experience a severe drought, taxpayers can only deduct 60% of their donation to the Ice Bucket Challenge.Taxpayers who made donations to the campaign are advised to consult with their tax attorneys to avoid being audited by the IRS.",0
"I AM STILL a bit shaky after learning from Inquirer editor in chief Letty J. Magsanoc that Joker Arroyo has “passed on to the highest court in the great beyond,” but I am under orders “to write a personal tribute,” so I write.When an Army general of the Marcos dictatorship slapped me with a P10-million libel suit in 1983 for my Panorama magazine article on human rights violations committed against rural folks in Bataan province, the publication gave me a lawyer, and from the Siguion-Reyna Law Office no less.And then I got a call from Joker Arroyo whom I had never spoken to personally but whom I knew as a tough human rights lawyer and defender of big-name Marcos victims as well as unknown ones languishing in the dungeons of martial rule. I had been familiar with cases documented by the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP), a mission partner of the Association of Major Religious Superiors in the Philippines, and had helped in some of their publications, so his name rang loud.His face was familiar too because he was among those often photographed with bigwigs of the anti-Marcos forces in rallies. He was also in photographs taken at the court trial of Ninoy Aquino that showed the defense team that included him and Sen. Lorenzo Tañada.Could he have a word with me? Joker said on the phone. Could we meet somewhere?Joker came alone to a small restaurant in Quezon City and offered to be my lawyer. Pro bono, of course. I told him that I already had a lawyer, Saklolo Leano of Siguion-Reyna. He said he knew “Sak,” that they would work together to defend me. He was insistent and I couldn’t help wondering why my case meant the world to him. Perhaps because his late sister Nimia was a writer, I mused.Defending women writersJust a little backgrounder. I had been the first writer to be interrogated by the defense department (1980) and later was one of several women writers who went through a series of interrogations conducted by a military tribunal (1983). “National Intelligence Board” was how the military officers called themselves. It was the brainchild of Gen. Fabian Ver, then the Armed Forces chief of staff. I called them the Sanhedrin.And then my case became like a trial balloon. In street-corner lingo, “sasampolan.” That was after our group, Women Writers in Media Now, routed the “National Intelligence Board” at the Supreme Court. We had a battery of human rights Mabini lawyers, with Tañada leading the pack, and Joker was among them.We thought it was over. All of a sudden, Brig. Gen. Artemio Tadiar, commander of the 3rd Marine Brigade, came out of the woodwork to claim he had been maligned by the article. He had become a military attaché somewhere, but a P10-million libel suit was staring me in the face. It was pure harassment.Rosary in his pocketI said yes to Joker defending my case. While saying goodbye after our talk, he pulled out something from his pocket, a handkerchief, I think, and out fell his rosary.The case was filed in Manila. I remember Joker telling me to make myself unobtrusive until bail had been posted, else I’d be handcuffed by the sheriff right there. At the preliminary hearing, Joker and Rene Saguisag clashed swords with then fiscal Jose Flaminiano (Joe Flame, Joker called him).Well, to my chagrin, the Joe Flame filed the case for hearing. I don’t recall the name of the legal maneuver Joker did to make the case hibernate but it did. Thankfully, it did not progress to see me impoverished and in prison because the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution happened.Still, I made sure the case was finally dropped. Joker, President Cory Aquino’s executive secretary, made sure that would happen.I was assigned to do a Sunday Inquirer Magazine cover story on Joker, the executive secretary (“Joker Arroyo Looks Back,” Feb. 24, 1991) for the fifth anniversary of the triumph of people power that saw the Marcos dictatorship crashing down. The Q & A is still quite a read.‘Humanized’Joker sent a handwritten letter dated Feb. 21, 1991, tucked inside a long white envelope with a Post-It on the flap. So old-school, I thought. He sent it through then Inquirer publisher Eggie Apostol.It read:“Eggie was indulgent enough to send me an advance copy. I felt great, being alternately humanized, then made bigger than life, then being combative, then supposedly humble in a stylish play of words and format only you can craft. Thanks really.“I kept reading and rereading it like a priest reads and rereads the breviary in blind faith. And the paper didn’t soil. Has the color any preservative?“Why don’t you, Lorna (then magazine editor), Bullit (Marquez, Associated Press photojournalist) and I meet for Chinese or Japanese, Filipino or Thai, Italian or Spanish lunch? Do set the date a week ahead or whatever. If mater publisher will condescend, it will be nice for her to join and stifle the fun. Most sincerely, Joker. P.S. Your handwriting is the trademark of a school.”A faxed letter, now fading on thermal paper, was his reaction to my feature article on the exhibit of medieval torture instruments and King Ludwig’s castle that I visited in Germany. It continued with a letter to magazine editor Lorna Kalaw-Tirol congratulating her.“Why my interest in this (the Inquirer magazine)? I was editor of the Chinese Commercial News, a pre-martial law Chinese language paper. When the Yuyitung brothers, Quintin and Rizal, owners, were deported in 1970, I took over as editor so the show (newspaper) will go on. Advertising became my concern and was illiterate in Chinese. I was their lawyer.”(The names of the Yuyitung brothers are now carved on the granite Wall of Remembrance of Bantayog ng mga Bayani dedicated to heroes and martyrs who fought, died or were imprisoned during the martial law years, a number of whom Joker had defended.)‘Equipoise’Another note, written on Civil Liberties Union of the Philippines/Free Legal Assistance Group stationery said: “Your answers conveyed unabashed humility and plain grit. Very searing. I just thought I should let you know.” I think it was about an article on me. Printed at the bottom of the stationery were the names Lorenzo M. Tañada, Jose W. Diokno and Joker P. Arroyo. The Mabini brotherhood of lawyers was not yet in existence then.From Joker, I learned the meaning of “equipoise” that he used to describe a trait of Sr. Mariani Dimaranan SFIC, human rights defender and founder of TFDP. After she died and I was writing an article on her, I asked Joker for a quote and he obliged. What a tribute he gave.So many years have passed but the women writers and the Mabini lawyers continued to keep in touch with each other, our way of expressing our appreciation for their stand and struggle to defend the oppressed and see justice prevail. A number of them later occupied elective and appointive positions in government, among them, Joker Arroyo (executive secretary, congressman, senator), Rene Saguisag (senator), Fulgencio Factoran (environment secretary), Augusto Sanchez (labor secretary), but they did not enrich themselves. (Joker, you know why I am saying this.)When we came together to wine and dine, there would be lots of reminiscences, political gossip, teasing, jokes and laughter. We would also speak about painful and crushing incidents in the past. Joker would come with his wry sense of humor but would occasionally give in to cajoling and break open his thoughts even while feigning disinterest in silly, mundane matters.No goodbyesThe second to the last time we lunched with Mabini lawyers Joker, Saguisag and Factoran was sometime in 2013. Joker ordered Chinese food and paid for it. When reminiscing time came, I suddenly remembered and narrated that small rosary incident with Joker when I was an endangered species. What do you know, the three formidable human rights lawyers, food in their mouths, instantly dug into their pockets and brought out their rosaries. Joker, too, had his.No goodbyes, Joker. You left on the month of the rosary. My prayers and sympathies to your daughters and your lawyer-wife Fely.I had written about persons who mattered to the lives of many and to my own, persons who are listed in my book. If I may quote myself, let me say and apply this to you, too: “You will be reborn in my words/ On the pages I write you will rise/ You will die say goodbye/ But I will remember/ I will make you live again in my words.”",1
"President Duterte on Sunday acknowledged that the Ferdinand Marcos regime had left a deep wound in the nation’s soul, but he stood firm on his decision authorizing the burial of the dictator at Libingan ng mga Bayani, not as a hero but as a soldier and former President.“So there was really a deep wound somewhere in the country. But for those who cannot really forgive, that’s the hard part. You just have to live with your grief, and that grief is hate. That is the problem,” Mr. Duterte told reporters after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima.“There are only two criteria [in law to be buried at Libingan]. And the problem is he fits both counts: as soldier and/or president,” Mr. Duterte said.He said the question of whether Marcos, whose body had been preserved in the family mausoleum in Batac, Ilocos Norte province, was a hero was a case of “a word against their word.”In Manila on Monday, former President Fidel V. Ramos joined the chorus of protests against the burial, carried out with stealth by immediate members of the Marcos family three decades after his death while in exile in Hawaii, declaring that move was “an insult to veterans” and a trivialization of the sacrifices of uniformed men.“Why did the sneaky burial happen without you knowing too much about it? Because there was advance planning, call it connivance, led by the Marcos family, together with some local police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines officials,” Ramos told reporters.Because of this, he said, the Duterte administration was “losing support, they are losing friends.”More than an apologyRamos, 88, also addressed criticism by Marcos’ daughter Imee that he himself should apologize for martial law atrocities because he was the chief of the Philippine Constabulary at the time.He said he had atoned for his sins by leading the Edsa People Power Revolution in 1986 that ousted Marcos.“I hope you people remember your history. My apology was more than an apology. In the Christian tradition, you confess and then you atone,” said the former general.Ramos rejected Imee’s claim that she and her siblings were still young during the martial law years and had nothing to apologize for.He said that Imee was one year older than his eldest daughter, who was 18 at that time, and was even elected president of Kabataang Barangay a few years after the declaration of martial law.Asked what should now be done, Ramos said, “The ball is now with the Supreme Court.”Relatives of victims of martial law abuses on Monday petitioned the high tribunal to exhume Marcos’ body.They said they had not been given enough time to appeal the high tribunal’s 9-5-1 ruling upholding Mr. Duterte’s decision to authorize the burial.“How can a plunderer and despot and violator of human rights be given that honor of being buried in the memorial of good men?” said Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, brother of an abducted anti-Marcos labor leader who was never seen again.All about lawMr. Duterte took exception to a newspaper article that noted the irony of the President’s own late mother Soledad Duterte, a leading figure of Yellow Friday Movement in Davao City, having protested Marcos’ rule during the final days of martial law.“You know, I am a public employee. I decide on what is lawful and what is not. I am now called upon or I was called upon to decide whether it would be lawful for Marcos to be buried at Libingan ng mga Bayani or it would be an illegal act,” he said.“My mother’s cause or the causes she fought in her life, that’s hers. But just because she is my mother I cannot state to you that Marcos cannot be buried because according to my mother he was a dictator,” Mr. Duterte said.The President insisted that he had not known about the date of Marcos’ burial at Libingan, which had been marked by secrecy and triggered street demonstrations.“In all honesty, I’m telling you: I knew nothing about it. They only asked me when the appropriate time for me would be. I said, ‘Do as you wish,’” he said.Being a hero not a criterion“I didn’t ask them, and why would I ask? I allowed it already so what’s it to me? What would I get if I have known in advance whether he will be there for the interment on that day?” Mr. Duterte said.He said as much as 98 percent of Ilocandia, or Ilocano-speaking Filipinos, harbored sentiments about why Marcos was being treated “unfairly.”“To me, again, I have only two answers: He was a President; he was a soldier. His name appears on the record, it was recognized, he had a valor medal for his deeds,” said Mr. Duterte, whose campaign platform when he ran in the May presidential election included a closure to the Marcos burial issue.Peaceful, private burialIn a press briefing, Col. Edgard Arevalo, Armed Forces spokesperson, said the military was merely acceding to the wish of the Marcos family to keep the burial peaceful, solemn and private.“It’s not secrecy … its primary consideration is the wish of the grieving family,” he stressed.Arevalo said the burial should not come as a surprise, citing the chronology of events that led to it.He said even the spokesperson of the Supreme Court acknowledged that there was no motion for reconsideration filed in court, thereby removing all or any prohibition with regard to the full implementation of the burial.",1
"Future national bridges in the country should not only be structurally sound but also aesthetically pleasing, according to the Department of Public Works and Highways as it released the Bridge Aesthetic Guidelines on Friday.Through Department Order 49, DPWH Secretary Mark Villar ordered the adoption of aesthetic consideration in all bridge plans and designs and stated the importance of valuing the appearance of bridges.“They should function not as mere utility but also as a significant element in the environment,” Villar said.“With the union of three aspects, namely, science, aesthetics and technology, we will come up with excellent bridge designs that will enhance beauty and character of our future landmark structures,” he added.The DPWH said proposed developments in all historical bridges will be done with approval from the National Historical Commission of the Philippines.“World-class and aesthetically designed bridges are seen to symbolize communities and serve as landmarks while increasing tourism in the country and promoting greater socio-economic developments,” the agency added.",1
" For newly appointed Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu, his first field work here was both a job orientation and a decision-making moment.A military career officer all his life, Cimatu was on unfamiliar territory but did not hesitate to ask the most basic questions, whose answers he would have been expected to know as the country’s top environmental officer.“Please explain to me what MPSA (mineral production sharing agreement) is, and why this company has possession of this land,” he asked his staff on Friday at a dialogue between officials of a mining company and the local government deep in the mountains here.Cimatu was in Palawan to investigate claims that the company, Ipilan Nickel Corp. (INC), had illegally cut thousands of old-growth trees. Days earlier, hundreds of Brooke’s Point residents, led by Mayor Mary Jean Feliciano, had stormed the INC compound to stop the tree-cutting.By then, company workers had cleared over 20 hectares of natural forest in Palawan, a province considered as the Philippines’ last frontier in ecological conservation.WarningIn response to Cimatu’s question, Roland de Jesus, Mining and Geosciences Bureau director, explained the government’s long-established system of entering into agreements with mining companies to exploit public lands for minerals extraction and sharing the proceeds with them. He also discussed the regulations that oversee the whole process.Easing into his role, Cimatu upheld the cancellation of the company’s tree-cutting permit and issued a warning to irresponsible miners about “going around the law.” He added: “You should be man enough to face the consequences if you make a mistake.”During the dialogue, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) found that the company had conducted tree-cutting activities despite repeated notices from the DENR canceling its permit.Cimatu’s predecessor, Gina Lopez, had already withdrawn INC’s permit but the company proceeded with the tree-cutting anyway, claiming that an appeal it had filed allowed them to continue operations.“We will allow mining so long as they follow the law,” Cimatu said later, unaware that his predecessor had taken the same stance.Environment Undersecretary Marlon Mendoza, De Jesus, and Regional Environment Director Natividad Bernardino, who were with Cimatu, took turns grilling the INC officials.As the government convoy tried to reach the area where most of the tree-cutting took place, it found the road blocked by trees that were deliberately felled to slow down the DENR party.Aside from the company’s brazen defiance, Cimatu learned that INC had refused his representative, Bernardino, access to the mine site.Business outlook“I’ve seen enough from the air,” the DENR secretary told reporters. “I saw the area, there really are no more trees. It was very unfortunate that this happened,” he added.INC was one of three mining companies in Palawan that had been sanctioned by Lopez during her short term. With its MPSA expiring next year, the company needs to convince the government to renew its agreement for another 25 years.Regulatory officials said they expect INC to lobby hard for the renewal of its MPSA next year as it was recently bought by major mining conglomerate, Global Ferronickel Holdings, a publicly listed company and the country’s third largest exporter of nickel ore.The INC concession covers close to 3,000 hectares and sits atop the town’s main watershed and rice production farms. Company officials said mining operations would not affect the local water supply.“I’m confident the DENR secretary will listen to our voice, (and our position) that we don’t need this mining company in our town,” Feliciano said.",1
"Three people were killed, while eight others were injured, in a highway accident here Monday afternoon after a wayward trailer truck hit a multi-cab van, police reported Tuesday.The victims were passengers of the multi-cab, which was struck by the Surigao-bound Aluminum Wing Van truck in Purok 1-Cebuano, Barangay Sumilihon, Butuan City, police report said.Police identified the fatalities as Princess L. Cawaling, 20; Ronald E. Balderas, 51; and Alex S. Avila, 33.Initial investigation conducted by the Butuan City Police Office-Station 4 (BCPO-S4) showed that an Isuzu van being driven by Viviano A. Paquibot, 59, was travelling towards Surigao City, while the multi-cab, driven by Seth June D. Aballar, 34, was on its way to Butuan City from Magallanes, Agusan del Norte when the accident happened at 12:10 p.m. Monday.According to an initial report from the BCPO-S4, “the rear tire of the van that was heading to Barangay Sumilihon, suddenly burst, causing it to swerve.”It was at this point that Paquibot may have lost control of the van, which crossed to the opposite lane, hitting the multi-cab.“Both drivers sustained injuries, and other multi-cab passengers sustained serious physical injuries,” it said.Injured were Ricky M. Lomanog, Jade B. Busa, Jessie John R. Balderas, Chona Mae C. de Lapeña, Viviano A. Paquibot, Welmart S.

" Officials of Environmental Practitioners’ Association (EPA) have lauded Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu for issuing Administrative Order 2017-18 which expedites the issuance of environmental compliance certificates (ECCs) back to the directors and regional directors of the Environment Management Bureau (EMB).Officials of the EPA, headed by its president Leslie T. Baun of International Wiring Systems Phils. Corp (IWSPC) and vice president Engr. Rogelio M. Magat of the Clark Development Corporation (CDC), expressed full support to the recent move of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on AO 2017-18.Cimatu issued the AO to authorize regional DENR offices to issue ECCs to requesting firms.During the time of former Secretary Gina Lopez, all ECC requests had to be evaluated by the DENR central office, and not the DENR office in the concerned region.Magat said the directive of Cimatu lifted the burden of project proponents whose applications for ECCs have remained pending at the central and regional offices, adding that ECC applications of some Clark Freeport Zone locators were also delayed by the required centralized processing of ECCs at the EMB Head Office in Quezon City, since February 2017 even for non-environmentally critical projects.Before February 2017, only environmentally critical projects were required to secure ECC at the EMB Head Office while other projects secure their ECCs only from regional offices or through on-line applications.",1
"Despite a record 6.7-percent inflation rate in September and escalating rice prices because of limited supply, three out of four Filipinos still believe that the country is headed in the right direction, the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey showed.The survey, conducted from Sept. 15-23, found that 75 percent of the 1,500 respondents believe the country was moving in the right direction, up 5 points from 70 percent in June.Respondents who said the country was heading in the wrong direction were 22 percent in September, down from 25 percent in June.“The Palace welcomes the results of [this] third quarter survey … [and views] it as a reflection of our people’s continued trust and confidence in the President,” said presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo.The survey results should inspire government officials and civil service employees to do their job better, he added.The SWS survey also showed that President Duterte’s net satisfaction rating was an “excellent” +72 among those who said the country was moving in the right direction, higher than the “neutral” -3 given by those who said the country was headed in the wrong direction.At 89 percent, Mindanao expressed the strongest belief that the country was on the right course, followed by Balance Luzon at 73, Visayas at 69 percent, and Metro Manila at 65 percent.Between June and September, belief that the country was heading in the right direction rose among Class D, from 70 percent to 75 percent, and among Class E, from 70 percent to 72 percent. It fell from 80 percent to 76 percent among Classes ABC.The poll used face-to-face interviews and had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3 percentage points.",1
"President Duterte on Friday raised the possibility that the recent killings of three teenage boys were carried out to sabotage the police.“These are deliberate,” Mr. Duterte said of the killings in a speech at the 17th founding anniversary of Digos, Davao del Sur. The police would shoot people, but would not make the effort to wrap up their victims, he added.“That is not the job of the police … Someone is sabotaging them,” the President said, adding that he does not tolerate unlawful killings.‘Within bounds of law’“We operate within the bounds of the law,” he said.Mr. Duterte added: “I am telling you, one of those killed was my relative. Carl Arnaiz. He was my relative, I want you to know that. Would I allow the police to kill my relative?” he asked.But the President did not say how he was related to the 19-year-old University of the Philippines student.‘Discredit’Arnaiz’s death and that of his 14-year-old companion, Reynaldo de Guzman, who was found dead with at least 26 stab wounds in Gapan, Nueva Ecija, drew public outrage.Mr. Duterte also told Philippine National Police Director General Ronald dela Rosa to be on alert because there was a brewing plan to “discredit (them),” adding that a “massive rally” was being planned.Massive rallyThe Movement Against Tyranny, which has been calling for an end to drug-related killings, is planning a rally on Sept. 21, the 45th anniversary of the declaration of martial law.But the President said he would allow these protests to go on and would order the military to remain in their barracks and the police in their stations.“Give them the space and they can shout all day,” he said.Mr. Duterte also blamed Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno for reportedly saying that suspects should not submit to an arrest without a warrant.“I told her, Madam Chief Justice, don’t teach the people a wrong thing. You have forgotten that there are arrests that can be made without a warrant. The war in Marawi, if somebody shoots at me, should I still run to the court first to secure a warrant? If an NPA rebel was being pursued, should I go to the municipal judge first?” the President said.Mr. Duterte again said that he would protect soldiers and policemen as long as they were performing their duties.Do not resist“The duty of the police is to put you in the custody of government, bring you to the judge that issued the warrant or to the police station for investigation,” Duterte said. “That’s why your duty is to surrender. Do not resist,” he added.At the same time, the President advised law enforcers to take drastic actions against suspects “only if your life is in danger, he resisted, because you have to place him under custody.”In Malacañang, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said that while the Executive, through the PNP, “will cooperate with the Senate investigation” into the deaths of Arnaiz and De Guzman, parents should do their part and watch over their children.‘Questionable activities’“Rogue cops, if and when allegations are proven true, have no place in an institution like the PNP and we need everyone’s full support and cooperation as we continue to cleanse its ranks,” he added.Parents should try to maintain more solid family relationships and must keep their children away from “questionable activities,” Abella said.“(W)arn them again and again, not to even be physically near, not to entertain suspicious activities or even companions,” he added.“Like we said earlier, any death, even just one single violent death is a call for concern, especially with the younger ones,” Abella said.“As we all know, the President is very concerned and deeply protective of the next generation,” he added.",1
"The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) will bring the controversial war on drugs to the country’s more than 42,000 barangays in a bid to curb user demand.PDEA director general Isidro Lapeña said his agency would shift its focus to the country’s smallest administrative unit to reduce the number of drug users.“We have shifted our strategy to the barangay drug-clearing program because this is where the drug problem thrives. This is where the trade happens,” Lapeña said in Davao City.“This affects the people at the grassroots. This is the one that matters actually and so we shifted our efforts [to] the barangay drug clearing program,” Lapeña said.He estimated there are about four million drug users in the country and this large market will always interest drug traffickers.“These four million users translate to a P120-billion drug industry,” Lapeña said.“If that is not reduced, then the P120-billion drug industry will always be something that … drug syndicates will always get into it,” he said.He said the PDEA had a productive year with P82.52 billion worth of drugs seized and 152 drug dens dismantled in the course of 64,397 operations.He also said a total of 3,171 drug personalities were killed in legitimate police operations that also resulted in the killing of 57 policemen.",1
" President Duterte was both jovial and solemn when he appeared at two separate events in Mindanao on Saturday after a five-day absence, quashing speculations that his health had deteriorated.Speaking to reporters after addressing troops from the 4th Infantry Division Advance Command Post in Butuan City, the President made fun of rumors that he was in a coma. Instead, he said he was in his “kama” (bed).“My state of health is what you see is what you get,” he said. “To my countrymen, do not worry too much. Don’t you want it? Maybe in one year, there would be a new President.”“If you can’t find me after five days, that means [I’m] dead, so you swear in [Vice President Leni] Robredo. What’s your problem? There is a Vice President,” he said.He also said that during his absence he traveled for two days “incognito” with his close aide to an undisclosed place in Mindanao.“I traveled like a private citizen to go where I wanted to go,” he told reporters. “I traveled at night because it was sub rosa.”Mr. Duterte was last seen in public on Sunday, June 11, when he attended ceremonies for Marines killed in a fierce gun battle in Marawi days earlier.He missed the Independence Day rites the following day, sparking rumors about his health.“I was really tired. It was not that I snubbed the Independence Day celebration,” he said.The President spoke in a serious tone when he addressed the troops from the 4th Infantry Division in Butuan’s Barangay Bancasi.“I call on you to continue performing your duty to our country, especially as martial law remains in effect in Mindanao,” he told soldiers as the military launched a fresh offensive to dislodge Islamic State (IS)-inspired fighters in Marawi on Saturday.“Remember the valor … of your fellow soldiers who offered their lives for their country.“I am filled with nice feeling, I love you all,” he said. “I am hurt whenever anyone of you gets into a bad fix.”He slammed “politicians” in Marawi, whom he did not identify, for helping the IS fighters bring firearms into the city surreptitiously.“All the while, the Maute, with the connivance of the politicians there, the warlords, were stockpiling,” he added.This, he said, was the reason the terrorist gunmen have not ran out of ammunition, including rifle grenades.“When government fires one, they fire back with five,” he said. “So it was like they have endless supply when Maute rose to fight the government.”The President said the terrorist gunmen had waited for the right time to attack.When the fighting erupted, “the Indonesian forces went down from the hills” backed also by a “conglomeration of Isis from Syria, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Arabs (Kuwaitis),” he said.The President said the fighting was “winding up but at the cost of many soldiers.”Because the government has already lost more than 50 soldiers in the fighting, he said they have to “finish” the terrorists.Mr. Duterte also assured the soldiers that government will provide everything they need.“I am with you in everything,” he said, adding that the soldiers’ needs will be a “priority.”“I will not abandon you,” he said, promising to raise a P50-billion trust fund for education of the soldiers’ children. “I know what’s always on your mind—your family.”“Because you’re always there out in the field, so my thoughts are always with you—how I can improve your lives and protect you,” he said.“I talk from the heart … I have a dirty mouth, but when I say that it is all with sincerity,” he added.All throughout his speech to the troops the President did not utter one cuss word.But it was a different President Duterte earlier that day in Cabadbaran, Agusan del Norte, where he joined the celebrations of the 50th foundation day of the province.He was his usual folksy self, cracking jokes as he spoke about his administration’s war on drugs, the communist insurgency and the nearly monthlong fighting in Marawi.At one point, he called on stage the wife of a former classmate from way back in kindergarten in the town of Candelaria.",1
"I believe that the problem in the Philippines is Politics. The government, national and local, are all doing their best effort to manage the post-typhoon rubbish, yet it is politics that got on the way. Binay distributed reliefs with the VP logo, Romualdez was saying not all people are being reached by relief goods of national government; Mar is unaccepting of the fact that there could have been 10,000 dead when the police official was suspended, PNoy was smiling a lot while being interviewed on TV by the international channel. The evacuees in Villamor as well as the volunteers there mentioned that at one time there was no coordinator to manage the volunteers.Despite of the best intention (good motive), politics here in our country is there to ruin the day.Source:http://getrealphilippines.com/blog/2013/11/sec-mar-roxas-character-exposed-in-interview-with-cnns-andrew-stevens-at-yolanda-disaster-site/comment-page-13/#comment-179436",0
"Typhoon “Hanna” swirled east of Batanes islands on Thursday, sucking in the southwest monsoon that dumped heavy rains over wide areas of the archipelago as far south as Mindanao.The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) warned against possible landslides in Quezon City and Muntinlupa and Marikina cities from rains triggered by Hanna (international name: Soudelor) as it plowed toward Taiwan.Flash floods caused by heavy rains over the past two weeks have killed at least seven people, including four children, in Bukidnon province, the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) reported, according to the Associated Press.The dead in Valencia City included a 6-month-old girl and three other children aged 6 to 9. They drowned on Tuesday but their bodies were retrieved on Wednesday.At 10 p.m. on Thursday, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) located the eye of the typhoon at 595 kilometers east northeast of Basco, Batanes province, with maximum sustained winds of 165 kilometers per hour near the center and gustiness of up to 200 kph. It is forecast to move west northwest at 20 kph.Pagasa said monsoon rains could trigger flash floods and landslides in the Southern Luzon region, Visayas and Mindanao.Weather forecaster Robert Badrina said the typhoon would continue to weaken as it approached Taiwan, passing through the Philippines’ northwestern waters.Hanna had supertyphoon strength that devastated Saipan in the Northern Marianas last week before it weakened as it swept across the Pacific.No landfallThe typhoon is expected to dump moderate to heavy rains within its 700-km diameter although it will not make landfall, Pagasa said.Storm Signal No. 2 was hoisted over Batanes including Itbayat as of 10 p.m. Thursday, while Signal No. 1 remained raised over Calayan and the Babuyan group of islands. It was also raised over northern Cagayan. As of Thursday afternoon, sunny weather prevailed over Batanes.On Friday afternoon, Hanna is forecast to be 290 km northeast of Itbayat, Batanes, and is expected to be 460 km northwest of Itbayat or out of the Philippine area of responsibility by Saturday afternoon.Badrina said cloudy skies with light to moderate rains and isolated thunderstorms were expected over Metro Manila, Calabarzon and the rest of the Bicol region during the weekend.Metro high-risk areasIn an emergency meeting with relief officials, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said officials were preparing for an estimated rainfall of 7.5 millimeters on Monday.He said landslides in some high-risk areas in the metropolis were also possible.The Department of Environment and Natural Resources said landslides could occur at Pansol, Loyola Heights, North Fairview, Greater Lagro, Old Balara, Batasan Hills, Payatas, Commonwealth (Lower Bayanihan), Bagong Silangan and Holy Spirit in Quezon City, Tunasan in Muntinlupa City and Barangay (village) Fortune in Marikina City.“These areas are already saturated and if heavy rains will come on Monday, landslides are possible,” said Raymond Ancog, senior geologist of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau.Zero casualtyCagayan Valley officials on Thursday alerted local governments in the provinces of Batanes and Cagayan to activate their disaster preparedness protocols.“We can’t be complacent,” said Odilon Pasaraba, assistant regional director of the Department of the Interior and Local Government. “Our target is still to have zero casualty.”In a video conference from the Pagasa headquarters, disaster officials from about 20 agencies in Cagayan Valley were apprised of the chances that Hanna would affect the northern areas.Worst-case scenario“The worst-case scenario based on Pagasa forecast is that Hanna will come closest to the Batanes group of islands by 8 p.m. on Friday. We will likely hoist the warning signal there to No. 2,” Pasaraba said.Days of heavy rains also triggered flash floods and landslides in Bohol and Antique provinces. No casualties were reported as of Thursday noon.In Iloilo City, classes were suspended in all levels due to heavy rains caused by Hanna.In Cebu, Bohol, Iloilo and Negros provinces, over 1,000 passengers were stranded after the Coast Guard suspended trips of small boats because of the gale warning by Pagasa.Trips of roll-on, roll-off vessels continued, according to Lt. Cmdr. Ramil Palabrica, Coast Guard commander of the Bacolod Station.The Coast Guard reported that motor tanker Masbate with 21 crew on board was stranded a kilometer from Campomanes Bay in Sipalay City after experiencing engine trouble. Its crewmen were rescued on Wednesday and the vessel would be towed to Cebu.Flooding in BoholTwo days of heavy rains set off floods and landslides in the southern part of Bohol, damaging seven houses and 20 hectares of rice fields, officials said.A landslide on Tuesday morning affected the villages of Pangdan, Tejero, Cambugason and Tubod Monte in Jagna town where at least 11 families were evacuated.Roads were also damaged in the villages of Cambugason and Tubod Monte.Flooding affected Barangays Pagina, Poblacion, Lo-oc, Pangdan and Alijawan with waist-deep floodwater swamping some areas of Poblacion.Knee-deep floodwaters hit Jagna Central Elementary School. Jagna Mayor Fortunato Abrenilla had suspended classes at all levels since Tuesday. Relief goods were given to the affected families.In Alingan, Duero town, also in Bohol, five houses were partially damaged by a landslide on Aug. 1, but did not cause injuries, according to the Red Cross.In San Remigio town in Antique, heavy rains triggered a landslide in the hinterland village of Maragubdub. No casualties were reported, according to the OCD.Authorities evacuated more than 400 families in seven barangays in Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte, after rains swelled rivers and threatened their villages, OCD officials said in Ozamis City. Three houses were damaged in a landslide, but no injuries were reported.–With reports from Maricar B. Brizuela in Manila; Jhunnex Napallacan, Leo Udtohan, Carla P. Gomez, Joel Franco and Nestor P.

"It’s that time of year when The Adobo Chronicles names its “Person of the Year.” Last year, we named actor Jackie Chan our person of the year for having survived persistent news that he had passed away. Talk about nine lives.This year, the publisher and editors of The Adobo Chronicles had a fairly easy job of choosing the winner: Philippine Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas.The “Person of the Year” is awarded to the individual or group that has made the most impact on national and international news. We couldn’t have chosen any other person who has been in the news as much as Roxas has.During the aftermath of the worst typhoon to hit the Philippines, Roxas was seen in ground zero overseeing relief operations and giving aid to residents except those who were loyal to his and President Aquino’s political nemesis, the Romualdezes. When there was a shortage of garlic in the Philippines, he was seen carrying a sack of garlic on his shoulder. When there was rumor about a rice shortage, he was seen carrying a sack of goverment rice on his shoulder. When Metro Manila experienced the worst traffic nightmare ever, he was seen directing traffic in one of Manila’s most congested street intersections. When Metro Manila’s light railway system (MRT) was the subject of intense criticism for its overcrowding, inefficiency and mismagement, Roxas was seen riding the train on non-commute hours.We couldn’t think of a better person deserving of the Person of the Year title. It was a great 2014 for Mar Roxas and the Philippines.And Roxas could just well be the next president of the Philippines!

"I planned to vote for him before because of his no-nonsense approach and actions against crime and criminals in general, so he's the last person I'd expect to make a joke about thinking of committing a crime as barbaric and heinous as rape especially given the fact that he had long years of first hand experience seeing dead bodies of victims of such an act… I've seen the whole video of that speech and listened to the backstory. He had himself get taken hostage at knifepoint risking his life and limb, and he himself lead the offensive using his own Uzi firearm to eliminate the bad guys. Yes, I acknowledge that these are indeed heroic acts on his part worthy of recognition, but I still struggle to find a good explanation for that rape joke.So I've watched the full video of his apology. He told the whole story again and said a lot of things but I didn't get the answer I was hoping for. What he said was he wasn't making a joke, and it was just gutter language uttered out of anger and frustration, and he grew up in a place where people talk that way. Well, I get all that except for the not making a joke bit which sounds like an outright lie to me. It's very clear based on his overall demeanor and the transcripts from the viral video that he was making a joke about it. They can spin it any way they want but it's all obvious on the record that he was making a joke.An honest answer I could've lived with would've been, ""I'm sorry for that joke. It was just my libido talking. I was thinking using my dick and in the process sounded like a dick. I have no excuse for this, I'm not perfect but I'm willing to do the dirty work to keep you all lazy assholes safe and clean."" Something like that would've been somewhat okay instead of trying to justify it… He gave a half-assed apology in general and refused to apologize to a particular entity. He said he's sticking to his guns…I was looking for a little bit of courage in admitting he was wrong and a little bit of humility as these are somewhat traits becoming of a good leader but he has neither…. So I think it's best if he should just stick to his literal guns and continue his work in Davao. It might not be a smart decision to look up to him as a leader after all, and I'm just realizing right now that I might just be one of the many pinoys desperate for change that got bedazzled by the rugged charm of the Duterte brand of justice.

"The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) has assailed President Duterte for his “bullheadedness” in allowing the burial of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos at Libingan ng mga Bayani.“[Mr. Duterte] is determined to squander the historical lessons treasured by the Filipino people. They are being politically disarmed from preventing the rise to power of future dictators,” the CPP said in a statement issued on Saturday.Mr. Duterte’s decision to allow the burial of Marcos at the heroes’ cemetery and the killings of hundreds of poor drug users and dealers have soured initially friendly relations between the President and the CPP.The President, a former student of CPP founder Jose Maria Sison, has appointed leftists to his Cabinet.Peace talksHe has also ordered a resumption of peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines to end one of the world’s longest-running communist insurgencies and bring peace to the countryside.But Mr. Duterte, a friend of the Marcos family, has said he will allow the burial of the dictator at Libingan ng mga Bayani, sparking protests from thousands of survivors of martial law abuses, human rights advocates, current and former legislators and ordinary people linked to the opposition to the strongman.He argues that Marcos deserves to be buried at Libingan because he was a soldier and a President, regardless of any misdeeds.Plan condemnedThe CPP condemned the plan of the Duterte administration to give Marcos a hero’s burial.“By claiming Marcos deserves to be buried with other former soldiers, [Mr.] Duterte is helping perpetuate the historical lies surrounding Marcos’ bogus medals and phony Maharlika guerrilla unit,” it said.By ordering that Marcos be accorded military honors befitting a former head of state, Mr. Duterte is “virtually deleting Marcos’ bloody record as a military despot and the fascist violence, human rights violation, corruption and economic hardships he made the Filipino people suffer through 14 years of dictatorship,” the CPP said.Giving Marcos a hero’s burial “will complete the Marcoses’ political restoration and will complete the whitewash of all the crimes they perpetrated against the people,” it said.Revising historyMr. Duterte, by “flaunting” his alliance with the Marcos family, is helping the “Marcosian scheme to revise history and make the younger generations overlook the colossal plunder and sale of the country’s patrimony, his debt-borrowing spree, his legacy of gross cronyism, his family’s ostentatious lifestyle built upon the poverty of the people, and his martial law’s massacre of freedom and democracy,” the CPP said.The President’s decision to allow Marcos’ burial at Libingan “displays extreme insensitivity to the sensibilities of thousands of victims, families and survivors of martial law,” it said.“He insults the memory of thousands of patriotic Filipinos from all walks of life who gave up their lives at [their prime] to fight for the dictatorship’s overthrow,” the CPP said.RELATED VIDEOS",1
"The 1987 Constitution promulgated during the Corazon Aquino administration abolished the death penalty “unless for compelling reasons involving heinous crimes, Congress hereafter provides for it.”In 1993, Congress passed Republic Act No. 7659, or the Death Penalty Law.In March 1996, the law was amended and prescribed death by lethal injection.Between 1999 and 2000, during the term of President Joseph Estrada, seven inmates were executed as part of his administration’s anticrime drive.The first and last to be executed were rapists Leo Echegaray, on Feb. 9, 1999, and Alex Bartolome, on Jan. 4, 2000. In between, two other rapists and three others convicted of killing a policeman were executed.In June 2006, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo abolished the death penalty. She said the measure had not proven to be a deterrent to crime and had become a dead-letter law. There were an estimated 1,200 inmates on death row at the time.",1

"Apparently, it is not only Scott Walker who is dropping out of the Republican presidential race; all 34 of the remaining 36 declared candidates are quitting, en masse.The first to drop out from the contest last month was Rick Perry, followed by an announcement today that Walker is also stepping down.But after the continued surge in the polls by frontrunner Donald Trump and the impressive showing by Carly Fiorina in last week’s CNN debate, all the others are throwing in the towel.Between Trump and Fiorina, the Republicans are confident that their standard bearer in the general elections will have a good shot at The White House, either against Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.The GOP says that the ideal match would be between Trump and Sanders, because of common hair-raising issues; or between Fiorina and Clinton who are both women.So now, the focus has shifted to the Democratic race.",0
"Six Presidential Guards of President Rodrigo Duterte were wounded in an ambush in Brgy Matampay Marawi, Lanao del Sur on Tuesday, a day before President Duterte’s visit in the province.Reports said that two of the member of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) was in a critical condition in the attack in Marawi.The wounded Presidential Guards have been rescued and brought to the Army’s 103rd Brigade headquarters in Marawi.The people behind the attack is still not identified, but there’s a possibility that the Maute Terror Group who pledged their allegiance with the Islamic State was behind the ambush.The Maute Terror Group is currently attacked by the Philippine Army in Butig.There’s still no updates if President Duterte would still go to Marawi City despite of the ambush.UPDATE: Armed Forces of the Philippines confirmed that six Presidential Security Group personel and two security escorts from the Military were wounded by an improvised explosive device (IED) while on their way to the headquarters of the 103rd Infantry Brigade.Brigader General Restituto Padilla, the AFP’s spokesman told radio DZMM that they recommended to postpone the visit of President Duterte to ensure their commander-in-chief’s securty",0
"ON or before he retires from the service next month, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff Gen. Ricardo Visaya wants the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) totally decimated, a military official said on Tuesday.Visaya said he is optimistic that the military will beat his self-imposed deadline on December 8, when he reaches the mandatory retirement age of 56, according to Col. Edgard Arevalo, chief of the AFP Public Affairs Office.“He is personally monitoring the developments, he is receiving briefings as regards the development on the ground and he is still optimistic that he will be able to beat the [deadline], he will be able to complete what he wanted to do before the end of his term,” Arevalo said.During the 3rd Quarter Command Conference at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City last month, Visaya ordered the 125,000-strong military to use all available war materiel to finish off the Abu Sayyaf.“Let us use all available tools of war in inflicting not just physical destruction but also in rendering a psychological blow against the ASG. Ensure their isolation from their local support system and make the communities resilient against the influence of terrorists,” he told military commanders.Since July this year when government forces started an all-out offensive against ASG strongholds in Sulu and Basilan, Arevalo said the military inflicted serious blow against the extremist group.“[We should not only look at the decimation of the Abu Sayyaf but also at our gains particularly at the support of our people that explains the surrender of a number of ASG members with their firearms],” he noted.From July to October 30, Arevalo said there were at least 70 jihadists killed in Sulu and Basilan.The all-out offensive also resulted in the wounding of 22 ASG members and the capture of 32 others.A total of 34 Abu Sayyaf bandits also surrendered to authorities during this period.On the government side, 15 soldiers were killed while 28 others were wounded in action.",1
"Sen. Grace Poe said on Thursday she planned to ask a family on Guimaras Island to undergo DNA testing to establish their claims she may be a blood relative.“I just learned that I am supposed to have an aunt in Guimaras. I will be happy if that will be true,” she told reporters on the sidelines of a Senate inquiry on an attempted break-in at a radio station in Iloilo City by an alleged drug lord.She said she had not talked to her supposed two sisters and aunt, identified as Lorena Rodriguez-Dechavez. She said that if there was a basis for their claim that they were her long-sought biological family “I would want them to undergo DNA testing, if they would allow it.”Poe was reportedly abandoned and later found in the baptismal font at Jaro Cathedral in Iloilo City in 1968.Reached by the Inquirer, Dechavez said they could undergo the DNA test any time. Dechavez said they have long known that Poe is the daughter of her sister Victoria, the eldest of 12 siblings, who died in 1996 of cardiac arrest.‘Silent all this time’She said Poe was taken from their home in Buenavista town in Guimaras to Jaro District in Iloilo for adoption.“We have been silent all this time because she was doing well. But we came out to defend and help her because her candidacy has been questioned,” she said.Poe said it would a big help if Dechavez turned out to be her aunt, considering the length of time she has been looking for her biological family.Basis for cases“I noticed that we have the same forehead. But there are many Ilonggos which have the same forehead as I do,” the senator said in jest.Questions on Poe’s biological roots have been used as basis for cases seeking her disqualification from running for President in next year’s election.Poe has filed a motion for reconsideration on the decision of the first division of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) rejecting her candidacy.“I know that this quest will not be easy. I’m ready. From what I see, it appears doubtful if the Comelec will decide in our favor. Let us just wait,” she said.RELATED STORIESMole led Grace Poe to take DNA testNo match: Poe’s DNA tests with probable kin3 Iloilo volunteers to undergo DNA test in aid of Grace Poe—lawyer",1
"Two persons found in possession of counterfeit Mighty cigarettes were recently arrested in Barangay Cut-cot, Pulilan, Bulacan.Police identified the suspects as Wilfredo Dimaano, 22, and Laarni Leslie Bautista, 21, who were caught with more than 60 reams of Mighty cigarette variants.A Mighty Corp. representative certified the products to be fake, citing inconsistencies in the packaging.Both suspects were charged with violating Section 155 (trademark infringement) in relation to Section 170 of Republic Act 8293, or the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines, under Case No. III-04-INV-16K-02327.The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has repeatedly warned that any violator caught in possession of any product proven to be fake will incur a penalty of two to five years’ imprisonment and a fine ranging from P50,000 to P200,000.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), illicit cigarettes generally fall under three classifications:• contraband, cigarettes smuggled from overseas without local duties paid;• counterfeit, cigarettes manufactured without rightful owners’ authorization and with deceptive intentions as well as avoiding duties; and•illicit whites, brands manufactured legitimately in one country but smuggled and sold to another while avoiding duties.These illicit cigarettes undercut the government in due taxes and are subject to penalties as prescribed by existing laws.Industry observers said counterfeit cigarettes tempt retailers because they turn in higher profit returns while deceiving non-discerning buyers as the products also carry fake cigarette tax stamps.Last month, authorities arrested two vendors in Isabela for also selling counterfeit cigarettes to add to the string of arrests and seizures by the combined efforts of the BIR, Philippine National Police, Bureau of Customs and National Bureau of Investigation over the past two years.",1
"A fire that razed around 80 makeshift houses of as many families caused the collapse of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) transmission tower on Wednesday in Muntinlupa City (Metro Manila).Supt. Gilbert Dolot, chief of the Muntinlupa City Bureau of Fire Protection, said the NGCP transmission tower fell down because its foundation was weakened by the fire that hit Alabang Viaduct exit in Barangay Alabang.Despite the collapse, no power interruption happened in the city, Dolot added.It, however, posed problems for vehicles traversing the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX).The fire started 12 minutes before 9 a.m. and was put under control around 9:15 a.m.No deaths or injuries were reported.Tez Navarro, chief of the city government’s public information office, said the 80 families were immediately assisted by the local government’s Social Welfare department.Navarro said Mayor Jaime Fresnedi promised to give financial assistance to the victims.Dolot said they are determining the origin of the fire and the total value of damage to property.In a statement, SLEX management apologized to motorists for the inconvenience caused by the fire near the Alabang north-bound exit plaza of the expressway.The north-bound Alabang exit plaza of SLEX was temporarily closed because of the collapsed NGCP transmission tower.",1
"Vice President Jejomar Binay assailed the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of Justice (DOJ) and Office of the Ombudsman for their “stubborn display of political arrogance” when he spoke at a convention of lawyers here on Friday.The Vice President told members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) that the DILG, DOJ and the antigraft body brazenly ignored the order of the Court of Appeals (CA) that stopped the Ombudsman’s order to suspend his son, Makati Mayor Junjun Binay, for six months.“Since when can an opinion and speculation overrule a court order?” Binay asked in his speech at the IBP national convention at a hotel here.“I am, indeed, thankful that all lawyers of note and legal experts, including our IBP president, have struck a blow for the rule of law by asserting the primacy of the temporary restraining order (TRO) over the unilateral interpretations of the two executive departments and the Ombudsman,” he said.Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, whose opinion was sought by the DILG after it claimed to have enforced the Ombudsman’s decision to suspend Mayor Binay for six months, lashed out against critics who contended that the government’s position was without legal basis.Dime a dozen opinions“So-called expert opinions are a dime a dozen these days and that is but right because of the constitutionally enshrined freedom of speech,” De Lima said on Friday in a speech to a conference of the Rotary International District 3800 in Manila.“But that doesn’t mean all these expert opinions are right, especially when they suggest that those who are legally mandated to actually render an expert opinion is wrong to do so,” she said.Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales said on March 17 that the preventive suspension order that she issued against the mayor had been served and implemented by the DILG before the appellate court issued the TRO.The TRO “has become moot and academic as there is no more act to be restrained,” she said.On March 11, Morales ordered the six-month preventive suspension of Mayor Binay and other Makati government officials who were facing an administrative case for the alleged overpricing of Makati City Hall Building II.On March 16, the DILG posted the suspension order at Makati City Hall and administered the oath of office on Vice Mayor Romulo “Kid” Peña Jr. as acting mayor at 9:47 a.m. Hours later, Mayor Binay obtained the TRO.Asked by the DILG about the matter, De Lima said the TRO was without legal force and effect because it was already moot as it came too late in the day.Contempt chargesThe Binay camp struck back by filing contempt charges against De Lima, Morales, Peña, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas and other DILG and police officials.In his speech, the Vice President stressed the need for upholding the rule of law, “without which justice can never prevail nor the stability of the social order be preserved.”“The rule of law provides predictability in the outcome of conflicts arising from transactions in commerce and industry. That is why upholding the rule of law is actually a prerequisite to progress,” he said.The senior Binay was mayor of Makati when the contract to construct the Makati City Hall Building II was awarded to a favored contractor.De Lima rebuts CA justiceSpeaking at the IBP conference on Sunday, De Lima maintained her stand that the CA had no legal authority to stop the implementation of the preventive suspension of Mayor Binay.De Lima reiterated that the TRO had been rendered “moot and academic” by the implementation of the suspension order on March 16.She also cited Section 14 of Republic Act No. 6770, or The Ombudsman Act of 1989, which stated that “no writ of injunction shall be issued by any court to delay an investigation being conducted by the Ombudsman, unless there is a prima facie evidence that the subject matter of the investigation is outside the jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman.”This law opposed what was discussed by CA Associate Justice Magdangal de Leon, who spoke at the convention on the challenges of the appellate practice.De Leon, a senior member of the appellate court’s Ninth Division, said the CA was prohibited from issuing TROs only on decisions or orders of the antigraft office. Since the case involving Binay was for a preventive suspension pending investigation, he said the appellate court could issue a TRO.But De Lima, who heard De Leon’s talk, disagreed. “He was citing jurisprudence. But may I add because it seems to point only to final orders of the Ombudsman,” she told the participants at the start of her speech.De Leon is not handling the contempt petition against the justice secretary.De Lima then went on to cite the Ombdusman Act of 1989 that prohibited any court, including the CA, from issuing a TRO or an injunction to stop investigations conducted by the antigraft office.“The essence of the provision is clearly to let the Ombudsman do its job. It has been difficult enough for the Ombudsman to hold powerful people accountable. Now, let us not make it more difficult by allowing court processes to derail its investigations,” she said.In a news conference on Friday, Binay said ignoring the TRO was tantamount to mocking the court. “It is like they were saying the justices were dumb. It is unfair. It is clear that they are defying the rule of law.”–",1

"The water level at La Mesa dam dropped to its lowest in five years, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration warned Thursday.As of 6 a.m. yesterday, the water level was at 72.68 meters. The dam supplies the water needs of thousands of residents in Metro Manila.Pagasa hydrologist Gine Nievares confirmed that this has been the dam’s lowest water level and the most abrupt drop in five years.“This has been the fastest drop we have recorded. Usually, we would expect the water level to drop around May every year but this has also been the lowest level that the La Mesa Dam has reached,” she told The Manila Times.Manila Water corporate communications head Jeric Sevilla said the company was preparing its deep wells and reducing water pressure to augment water supply.“We do not want to wait for water interruptions to occur, hence, we are preparing deep wells which have not been used before on stand-by…we have also limited the water level entering the East La Mesa treatment plant,” he said in a radio interview.Sevilla noted that if La Mesa’s water level continues to drop and if consumers fail to conserve water, supply interruptions will hit customers in Marikina City, Montalban and San Mateo in Rizal province.Manila Water maintains a 78 or 79-meter water level to cater to its 6.8 million customers in Metro Manila’s east zone, Sevilla said.",1
"Following the killing of a priest and a pastor last week, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) on Thursday called on the government to stop such attacks against members of the church.In a statement, CBCP-National Secretariat for Social Acton, Justice, and Peace (NASSA) Bishop Rolando Tirona said the government should protect churchmen against people, who seek them harm, including government security personnel.“NASSA demands the government to stop its security forces from acts of violence on Church people, who commit themselves to serve and work with the poor towards empowerment and development,” Tirona said.Rather than enemies of the state, Tirona said the government should consider members of the Church as partners in providing service to public.“Church people are only complimenting the government’s task in promoting, defending and fulfilling the human rights of the Filipinos for common good,” Tirona said.CBCP-NASSA issued the statement after the reported death of Fr. Marcelito “Tito” Paez from the Diocese of San Jose (Nueva Ecija) and Pastor Lovelito Quiñones of the King’s Glory Ministry in Mindoro.Paez was killed by unidentified armed men, while Quiñones died during skirmish between military forces and the New People’s Army (NPA).Tirona said the killing of the two churchmen could be considered as attacks against the Church.",1
"When United States President Donald Trump visits our part of the world on November 3-14, he will be attending to many American concerns in the region where it has long maintained a position of leadership and military strength.Near Japan is the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan with its strike force of guided missile destroyers and cruisers. To the south near Singapore is the aircraft carrier USS America with its jet fighters and Marine landing craft. Near Australia is the USS Bonhomme Richard. With these strike forces, the US does not really need any land base in the Pacific.President Trump has said that in this coming visit, he wants to see what he can do about the US trade deficit with China, Asia’s growing economic power, but his main concern is the threat posed by North Korea and the US needs China to help keep this nation in check.The coming meetings in Japan, South Korea, China, and Vietnam on November 3-9 and in Manila for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit on November 10-14 will, in all likelihood, be dominated by the North Korea issue. For this is the one issue that poses a threat to the US in the most basic way— a nuclear attack via an intercontinental ballistic missile.North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un has exchanged outright nuclear threats with President Trump, aside from the most undiplomatic insults. Both North and South Korea would most certainly be devastated in any outbreak of war and Japan has denounced the direct threat posed by North Korea’s missiles passing directly overhead on their way to the Pacific. But Kim says its missiles can now reach the US mainland.President Trump’s threats of “fire and fury” have been met by Kim blasting the US president as “mentally deranged.” For a while in the US, there was a rift between Trump and his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who had been calling for a diplomatic solution.The rest of East Asia and the Pacific have not been directly involved in the (so-far) war of words but if a nuclear war should break out, the entire world would suffer and not just from the radioactive fallout. It is this fear that is at the back of everyone’s mind as the Pacific nations meet this November with President Trump. The series of meetings will end right here in Manila at the ASEAN Summit.Meetings in previous years have been largely goodwill affairs among the leaders of friendly nations, with arms clasping one another in photos. But this one will be facing right in front of it the ominous threat of nuclear war and devastation.",1
"Major players in the construction industry here said there is a shortage of manpower in Davao City, caused by the increasing demand of workers due to the property development boom in the city.Davao Constructors Association Center Inc. (DCACI) president Michael U. Te told a business forum on Tuesday that the demand for workers has been on an uptick, following an aggressive expansion of the real estate industry in the city with that kind of attention it is drawing from big investors.He also said the Duterte administration’s ambitious “build, build, build” program has also helped push the industry growth, citing for instance the bigger budget allocation for Mindanao for the infrastructure projects.However, the executive could not readily provide the figure as to how many workers are needed to fill the industry gap but that some of the contractors are sourcing manpower from different areas in Mindanao to be able to push through with the projects in the city.But for a building worth P50 million, he said they need between 80 and 100 workers.“There is a problem on the workforce,” he said.Manila-based Patrick Lawrence C. Tan, chief executive officer of Global Link MP Events International Inc. who is also organizer of the 8th Philconstruct Mindanao in the city, said there is a shortage of manpower because the population of Mindanao is not big enough to meet the industry requirement for labor force.He said the construction industry is labor-intensive.He said workers do not have to go to Manila anymore to find employment because the city’s demand for workers is already high.“There is shortage, so (construction) equipment becomes very important,” he said.",1
"Officials confirmed on Monday that the theft of a computer at a Lanao del Sur election office in January put the country’s records on 76 million voters at risk in yet another large-scale data breach.The National Privacy Commission (NPC) announced that it had begun investigating the “very concerning” matter and that it had ordered the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to shore up protection of its database of sensitive personal information.But the Comelec downplayed the possibility of an actual data breach as “remote,” owing to the use of the leading AES-256 encryption system.Even as the incident took place in a province that has seen election violence and cheating allegations, the poll body denied the likelihood of the theft having any effect on the results of the 2016 elections.The Jan. 11 robbery in Wao town is potentially the second such breach of voter data, after the March 2016 hacking of the Comelec’s website led to the so-called Comeleak, dubbed the worst-ever breach of a government-controlled database to have exposed the public to identity theft.The Comelec reported the theft to the NPC only on Jan. 28 because the poll body had initially treated it as a simple robbery that happened to target the newest computer at its Wao office.Second large-scale breach“This is already Comelec’s second large-scale data breach in a span of less than a year—a case of a database being breached twice under different circumstances,” NPC Commissioner Raymund E. Liboro said in a statement.Liboro stressed that the loss of personal data was “not only an [information technology] security issue involving firewalls” but also “a governance matter that covers organizational and physical measures to protect data.”The Feb. 3 report of Comelec Executive Director Jose Tolentino Jr. to the NPC acknowledged dire consequences if the robber managed to crack the encryption of the data.“If the robber will be able to gain access to the VRS (voter registration system), and to decrypt the VRS and the NLRV (national list of registered voters) data, the personal data might be used by unscrupulous persons for purposes other than those legitimately intended,” said the eight-page report that was released only on Monday.Yet, during his joint briefing with Liboro, Tolentino maintained that thus far, the “data breach has not been confirmed actually” as “all the data are encrypted.”He said the VRS in the stolen computer was “not in any way connected” to the vote-counting machine. “The only output would be the list of voters,” he explained.The stolen desktop computer contained the NLRV and the VRS for Wao.Tolentino said the NLRV was limited to demographic data—name, birthday and similar personal information—of the country’s roughly 75.9 million registered voters (55.2 million of which are active). But the VRS also captures the biometric data of 58,364 locally registered voters in Wao.Assistant Secretary Allan Cabanlong of the Department of Information and Communications Technology said “technically, you cannot break AES-256 without the key.”But Liboro pointed out that once the stolen data were out there, there would be no way to know if it had been decrypted and used.“Whenever you lose control of data, you can never be 100 percent sure of anything,” the NPC head said. “Precisely, you have lost control of the data.”Still, Tolentino told reporters that the agency had started abiding by the NPC’s subsequent Feb. 13 order to delete the NLRV databases in 1,656 municipal election offices nationwide.The database was used to verify voter registration status. But after the robbery, the Comelec plans to limit access to the NLRV only to 81 provincial offices and the National Capital Region’s office.Quarterly passwordsLikewise, the Comelec on Feb. 14 approved multifactor authentication to gain access to the VRS and NLRV, the use of passwords that expire quarterly and the streamlining of registration forms to remove the need for unnecessary personal data like height and educational attainment.Other measures taken up include limiting the number of personnel who could access data, mandating the regular change of passwords, recording which data have been transmitted electronically and requiring field offices to report to Manila before disposing of unusable computers and no longer useful records.Tolentino said he also issued a recommendation to Comelec commissioners to procure closed-circuit television cameras for all field offices, although at a hefty cost of P63.4 million.The poll body also planned to press the Philippine National Police regional headquarters to speed up the investigation of the theft.Liboro, who was seated beside Tolentino during the briefing, said the theft would be treated independently from the earlier Comeleak, the probe of which was concluded only recently.He acknowledged that the Comelec was “actually instituting policies” in coordination with the NPC, even if it may not have been fast enough to avoid a repeat of the data breach.“We just have to speed these things up because we get overtaken by this kind of events,” Liboro told reporters.In January, the NPC recommended that Comelec Chair Andres Bautista be criminally prosecuted for “gross negligence” over the March 2016 hacking of the Comelec’s website that led to the leak of voters’ personal information.The NPC’s criminal findings have not been forwarded to the proper authorities yet, according to Liboro, because it is being appealed by the Comelec.Several databases hitThe hacking of the Comelec website hit several databases.There was the voter database in the Precinct Finder web application with 75.3 million records, the database in the Post Finder with 1.38 million records, the iRehistro database with 139,301 records, the firearms ban database with 896,992 records (20,485 firearms’ serial numbers) and the Comelec personnel database with 1,267 records.The Post Finder has details, such as passport information, biometrics description, taxpayer number, mailing address, citizenship, name of spouse, profession, height and physical identifying marks.",1

"attempt to distract everyone from a galactic-scale scandal attendance at the recent APEC forum was Among the litany of gaffes and dubious “gains” presented by President BS Aquino as results of hisattendance at the recent APEC forum was a minor point whose irony likely has flown over most of the heads of typical Pinoy news consumers:Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said the Philippines wanted to learn from the “best practices of Chile” in terms of taxing their mining industry. “Chile is the world’s largest exporter of copper and a few years ago they revised the scheme of taxation of their mining industry that is one that recognizes the volatility of mining prices. So this is one that we would like to study,” Purisima added.Just to be clear, this means that several weeks after the issuance of an Executive Order spelling out a “mining policy”, an E.O. that took about 18 months to produce and which has as one of its main objectives the improvement and rationalization of government revenue from mining, the Administration has decided it would actually “like to study” the topic of mining taxes.",0
"Republican Senator Lindsey Graham today officially endorsed Hillary Clinton to be the next president of the United States.The former presidential candidate from South Carolina surprised both Democrats and Republicans with his announcement as he made a scathing criticism of GOP frontrunners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, as well as Democrat Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s main rival for the Democratic nomination.Graham compared the choice between Trump and Cruz “like being shot or poisoned.” He added, “It scares the hell out of me. Donald Trump, I think, is the most unprepared person I’ve ever met to be commander in chief, and when it comes to Sen. Cruz, he’s exhibited behavior in his time in the Senate that make it impossible for me to believe that he could bring this country together.”At the same time, Graham called Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, a self-identified socialist, “by far the most liberal person to ever offer themselves as a candidate in a serious fashion for president of the United States.” In Bernie’s world, the big banks are out to get you and rich people are screwing the system so you don’t have a chance,” Graham said.When Graham suspended his presidential campaign, he endorsed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush who now has also quit the race.With Clinton being the only other remaining presidential candidate Graham did not mention or criticize, it goes without saying that he is endorsing her.It’s “crossing the aisle” in Washington, Graham style!",0

"In their last moments before Moro rebels mowed them down, the ill-fated members of the elite Special Action Force (SAF) phoned and texted relatives and friends, pleading for help, asking them to tell their superiors that they had been surrounded and that they needed reinforcements.Some appealed for cell phone loads. Another trooper, apparently fearing his hour had come, joined his mother on the other end of the phone and prayed the rosary with her.Sen. Ralph Recto recounted to the Inquirer the last moments of the SAF commandos before they were killed, and proposed that the Senate invite their bereaved relatives to a proposed Senate probe.Recto said the SAF commandos’ widows, mothers and other loved ones could provide added insights on what really transpired during the SAF operation to arrest a Malaysian terrorist hiding in Maguindanao province.Sen. Grace Poe, who will hold an inquiry on the debacle next week, said this could be done.Recto said that in the hours before they perished, several of the police commandos, through their cell phones, asked their relatives to transmit their pleas for help to their superiors.“There were many who were pleading with their friends, relatives to convey to their higher-ups their need to be reinforced and extracted, which unfortunately did not happen,” Recto said in a statement.Praying the rosaryMany of the relatives told Recto they were in constant touch with the commandos until the latter’s cell phones ran out of battery or they had used up their phone loads.“The embattled SAF men were talking and texting their relatives. Some of them had asked for cell phone load from their relatives,” he said.One SAF member who seemed to have sensed that his situation had become hopeless, was joined in praying the rosary by his mother, Recto added.Recto said he learned all these during his visit to the wake of the slain operatives in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, on Thursday.He also noted the narration of some relatives that they had received text messages from the commandos at 2 or 3 in the afternoon of that Sunday, contradicting reports that the firefight had ended at noon.‘Black box’Recto said the text messages of the SAF forces and their conversations with their relatives were “the nearest that we have to a ‘black box,’” referring to the device that records what transpires in an airplane.“You want to piece together the picture on the ground at that time? Then we can get it from the persons they last talked to. It may not be the whole picture, some may just provide snapshots, but it will help investigators draw the scenario at that time,” Recto said.He said the last words of the slain SAF men would be known through their text messages or in the stories they told their loved ones.“We need honest words, unblemished by political bias. That can take place only between the closest of kin,” Recto said.Originally posted: 10:01 PM | Tuesday, February 3rd, 2015RELATED STORIESPNP probe body to look into why over 300 SAF men failed to rescue 44 SAF menRoxas meets SAF 44’s kin but has no answers",1
"Two freight trains collided and derailed shortly before midnight, injuring four people and igniting a fire that forced nearby residents to evacuate, authorities said Monday.Nearby residents were evacuated “out of an abundance of caution after the crash was reported at 11:14 p.m., Lexington Fire Lt. Jessica Bowman told The Associated Press. Bowman said she couldn’t confirm what substance had spilled and was burning, but the people were allowed to return home once safety risks were ruled out.Police told the Scott County School superintendent, Kevin Hub, to open schools as emergency shelters, and buses were sent to the neighborhood to collect people without transportation. Hub said he could see smoke billowing from the scene and they were prepared to receive hundreds of people. The Red Cross even arrived with snacks. Shortly after many residents arrived, they were able to return home.Bowman said she had no information about the four injured and their conditions. The crash remains under investigation.At Lemons Hill Elementary, Christina Griffin said she was asleep when neighbors called her around 11:30 p.m. to say they needed to evacuate. As she and her son were leaving, an officer warned them to get out of the neighborhood, she said.Betty Boyer had just laid down when she heard what she thought was something exploding.“We thought, what the hell was that? Was it a train? Was it a trailer? We didn’t see any smoke,” she said. Then she then got a call from her son in Missouri asking if they were being evacuated. He’d apparently received a message from a friend who saw the accident on Facebook, she said.She grabbed her purse and a pillow and headed over to the elementary school.“I’m supposed to be up at 6 a.m. in the morning to go to work,” she said. “That ain’t happening.”",1

"Occidental Mindoro Rep. Josephine Sato on Sunday supported Sen. Panfilo Lacson’s call for Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III to investigate allegations that members of the Commission on Appointments (CA) were bribed into rejecting the nomination of Gina Lopez as environment secretary last week.“I believe inaction will be a disservice to our people and to our country. Any allegation that undermines the integrity and independence of the CA must be taken seriously,” said Sato, a CA member like Lacson.Malacañang on Sunday defended President Duterte after Lacson chided him for making a “sweeping assault” on the Commission on Appointments.Mr. Duterte said that “lobby money” was involved in the rejection of Lopez’s nomination to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).An environment advocate, Lopez incurred the ire of big mining companies after she ordered in February the shutdown of 23 of the country’s operating mines allegedly for ruining watershed areas. She also canceled 75 mineral production sharing agreements.Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said that what Mr. Duterte said merely highlighted the existence of certain vested interests in the appointment of officials.“This, however, does not in any way diminish the integrity of the Commission on Appointments,” Abella said in a statement.Guidance from PresidentLacson turned the tables on Mr. Duterte on Sunday as he surmised that the lawmakers who voted to reject Lopez had sought guidance from the President.The senator noted that several CA members, like Senators Manny Pacquiao and Juan Miguel Zubiri, were known to be close allies of the President.“There are members close to the President who have a direct line to him. I’m almost sure they first asked him [on what to do with Lopez],” Lacson said on dzBB.Lacson was among the 16 CA members who voted on Wednesday to reject the President’s nomination of Lopez, a member of the family that owns the broadcast giant ABS-CBN.Eight of the 24-member commission, including opposition Senators Franklin Drilon, Francis Pangilinan and Bam Aquino, voted for the confirmation of Lopez’s appointment.But Lacson lashed out at fellow CA members who stood up during the commission’s plenary session to make public their support for Lopez, saying this was a violation of the commission’s amended rules that required secret balloting.Lacson said the action of some of his colleagues practically unmasked those who were against the nomination of Lopez.Citing the result of the secret balloting, he said some of the lawmakers who had claimed in the media that they supported Lopez actually voted to reject her.He argued that while some senators voiced out their support for Lopez during the plenary session, they did not formally oppose the CA decision to reject her nomination.In a statement, Sato said she did not question Lopez’s passion for the environment and her vigorous campaign against irresponsible mining.Rule of law disregardedBut Sato said the tendency of Lopez to use her “prerogative over established rules and regulation, and ignore due process [was] an utter disregard for the rule of law and [showed] a lack of understanding of the function and role of the executive department.”As a result, Lopez “inadvertently gave illegal loggers, irresponsible miners and environmental criminals a loophole or a workaround through legalese and technicalities to the detriment of affected communities and the marginalized sectors,” the congresswoman said.Sato said Lopez had also set aside civil service rules when she hired 55 “consultants” and officials.",1
"Everyone is so focused on the same-sex marriage case now before the U.S. Supreme Court that a recent high court decision on heterosexual marriage went practically unnoticed.On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a decision by the 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco banning the marriage of two heterosexual couples.The case stemmed from a lawsuit filed by a gay couple challenging the marriage between the heterosexual couples in Alpine County, California. The county has a population of 1, 1775 (as of the 2010 census), making it the least populous county in the state.In the lawsuit, Smith & Smith vs. Alipine County, the gay couple sought to invalidate the marriage licenses of two heterosexual couples who were married at Markleeville City Hall. The gay couple, John and Paul Smith (no blood relation), argued that the county cannot grant marriage licenses to the heterosexual couples because it does not extend the same right to gay couples. “It violates the state constitution, particularly the provision for equal rights and protection,” the lawsuit argued.The gay couple won the lawsuit but the decision was challenged by the county, elevating the case to the 9th Circuit Court, which subsequently upheld the original local court decision. The county then filed an appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court.The Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 in favor of the gay couple. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Breyer to form the majority ruling. Roberts penned the decision.While the LGBT community considers this a huge victory, it now means that all same-sex marriages will also be invalidated and banned until the Supreme Court issues a decision this summer on the pending case that would pave the way for federal recognition of same-sex marriage.The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments starting April 28, whether all 50 states must allow gay and lesbian couples to marry, positioning it to resolve one of the great civil rights questions in a generation.",0

"AMID criticisms hurled against him over his supposedly misogynistic behavior, President Rodrigo Duterte has tried to appease his critics by saying he believes women are competent and capable, but could not stand “threats and intimidation.”In his remarks in Davao City on Thursday night, Duterte said he still trusted the capabilities and competence of women, but stressed that some jobs were not for them.“We get used to fist fights, scrimmages, and shooting incidents. And we grew up with a sort of a mindset that sometimes is prone to violence,” the President said.“Women are prim and proper. With just one look of their mothers, they will melt. And you will make them cops? It’s not that I don’t believe them. I believe in the woman, their competence and capability but not in all aspects of life… It’s not appropriate,” he added.Duterte made the remark after women activists launched a social media campaign using the hashtag #BabaeAko to lash out at his derogatory remarks against women.The President earned the ire of women activists over his controversial remark that he would not appoint a woman to the Ombudsman or the Supreme Court.Women activists, including former social welfare secretary Judy Taguiwalo, called on women to “fight back” against Duterte.On Wednesday, Special Assistant to the President Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go came to Duterte’s defense, saying the President’s style of self-expression “has always been taken out of context.”Contrary to what others believe, Duterte has “high respect for women,” he said.Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr., meanwhile, said the President’s statement was “a mere play of words.”“PRRD’s (Duterte’s) statement reflects his growing frustration over the continuous and non-stop tirades against his administration by the ousted chief justice and the ombudsman,” Roque said in a statement on Wednesday.",1
"Communist rebels led by Jose Ma. Sison and representatives of the Aquino administration have signed what was described as an “interim peace agreement” that may serve as a stepping stone to a permanent pact with the incoming Duterte administration.Members of a government delegation, sent by President Aquino in 2014 to The Netherlands to hold back-channel talks with leaders of the communist-led National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), gave the Inquirer a copy of the document, titled “Joint Agreement on the Resumption of the Formal Talks on the Peace Negotiations between the GPH (Government of the Philippines) and the NDFP.”The document bore the signatures of Sison and top NDFP negotiators Fidel Agcaoili, Vicente Ladlad and Danilo Borja, and members of the “secret” government delegation—Hernani Braganza, Jaime Aristotle Alip, Efren Moncupa and Francisco Lara Jr.A member of the government delegation said many officials involved in the talks were surprised that Sison signed the document, adding that the acknowledged founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) has not signed any document resembling an agreement with the Philippine government following the collapse of peace talks under then President Corazon Aquino.The delegations said the document, signed on Dec. 8, 2014, was a strong indication that the NDFP was not only willing to enter into a peace agreement but was also ready to embrace a life of peace for communist rebels, both armed and unarmed.READ: Joma Sison: Duterte victory good for national unityFrameworkAccording to the document, the parties agreed to:Reaffirm the 1992 agreement, called The Hague Joint Declaration, between the government and the NDFP, which became the framework for the start of formal peace talks, and specified that no conditions must be imposed on either party to start the talks.Accelerate the pace of formal peace talks by forming smaller “reciprocal working groups” that would hammer out political and constitutional reforms, end to armed hostilities and what to do with members of the CPP armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA).Draft and sign an agreement on “truce and cooperation” that would immediately lead to a cessation of fighting and would last depending on a timetable to be determined by the government and NDFP negotiators.Give priority, during the duration of the truce, to negotiations on a Comprehensive Agreement on Socioeconomic Reforms, which would list down the measures needed to achieve social justice, like a new land reform program and programs to bring about industrialization.Immediately convene working committees on social, economic, political and constitutional reforms that would give flesh to general agreements on social justice, economic equality and human rights. According to the document, the NDFP and back-channel negotiators set January 2016 as the target completion date for agreements on these issues.Virtual pactCopies of the document have been furnished President Aquino and the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process. The latest recipient of a copy of the document is Rep. Silvestre Bello III, who has been named by presumptive President-elect Rodrigo Duterte as head of the peace panel that would negotiate with the NDFP.According to a delegation member in the 2014 talks, the document is virtually a peace pact which needed only official imprimatur.“This is it,” said the member, who requested anonymity for lack of authority to disclose details of the 2014 talks.Another delegation member, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said what set the 2014 interim agreement apart from previous agreements is that NDFP “made a lot of concessions.”“They were not even calling for the release of all (rebel suspects), only those involved in the peace process,” said the member, who had taken part in talks with the NDFP under previous administrations.He said that while there was mention about the US government’s classification of the NDFP, CPP and NPA as terrorist organizations during the back-channel talks, this was not even discussed in the drafting of the interim agreement.“They (NDFP leaders) did not demand it (to be removed from the US terror list),” said the delegation member.READ: Joma Sison welcomes Dureza, Bello as gov’t peace adviser, negotiator with CPP-NPAAnother breakthrough in the 2014 negotiations, he said, is an agreement to hold marathon discussions to fast-track the peace process. “Like a conclave,” he said, referring to the process of electing a Pope.He said there would have been a “national, indefinite ceasefire” had the interim agreement been followed quickly by a formal signing.There was also an agreement to hold discussions by the smaller working groups simultaneously to fast-track the process. “Everything would be tackled in one fell swoop,” he said.The interim agreement has been shown to military officials, according to the source. “They were OK with it,” he said. “They did not revise anything.”The 2014 talks were described as a success compared to previous government attempts to restart formal discussions with the communist leaders.The delegation led by Braganza laid the groundwork for its trip to The Netherlands by talking first with communist leaders in the Philippines, among them NPA leaders based in Mindanao.Five tripsIt took five trips to The Netherlands before the interim peace document was signed, according to the sources.The back-channel talks took so much time that “so many Marlboros (cigarettes) had been puffed,” said one delegation member referring to how the negotiators spent break times.While the document signed by Sison and other NDFP leaders may be still a step away from a formal pact, it should be used by the incoming government negotiators as a take-off point. “This is already a good deal,” said one of the delegation members.“All that is needed is to make this formal,” he said.READ: CPP-NPA prepares list of nominees to posts in Duterte Cabinet",1

"Lawmakers on Wednesday rejected the nomination of Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. after ruling that he lied to them about his American citizenship.By rejecting his nomination, the Commission on Appointments (CA) effectively fired Yasay, throwing the Philippines’ diplomatic leadership into turmoil at an important time for the country, which holds the rotating chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).Sen. Panfilo Lacson, chair of the CA’s foreign relations committee, said President Duterte could not reappoint Yasay.Acting secretary to be namedMalacañang said Mr. Duterte would name an acting foreign secretary.Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the Office of the Executive Secretary would communicate with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) by 8 a.m. Thursday.“Announcement will be forthwith,” Abella said.The DFA spokesperson, Assistant Secretary Charles Jose, said the department would wait for Mr. Duterte’s appointment of an acting secretary.It was unclear on Wednesday what steps the government would take against Yasay for concealing his US citizenship as he served as associate commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 1993 to 1995 and as chair of the body from 1995 to 2000.Yasay also unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Senate in 2001 and 2004, and for Vice President in 2010.He was the first Duterte nominee to be rejected by the CA.In an extremely rare move, the CA unanimously voted to reject Yasay’s nomination following tense confirmation hearings in which he admitted to misleading the lawmakers.“He was not telling the truth. He was not being forthright in the question-and-answer portion of the (confirmation) hearings,” Lacson said.Yasay, appointed by Mr. Duterte at the start of his administration eight months ago, told the initial hearing on Feb. 22 that he had never been an American citizen and that he had never held a US passport.But the Inquirer, citing documents that contradicted Yasay’s declaration, reported on Feb. 27 that Yasay was granted American citizenship in 1986.The documents also showed that Yasay formally renounced his American citizenship at the US Embassy in Manila on June 28 last year, just two days before Mr. Duterte appointed him to head the DFA.Apology and admissionIn a television interview on Monday, Yasay admitted he once carried a US passport, but said he had returned it along with his naturalization certificate.He said he renounced his US citizenship in 1993 and that the document he filed in Manila last year was only for confirmation and reiteration of his renunciation.On Wednesday, Yasay faced the CA again and was grilled over the documents that showed he was granted US citizenship in 1986.He insisted that he never lied about his citizenship but apologized for “inadvertently misleading” the commission.His last stand collapsed when Mindoro Rep. Josephine Ramirez-Sato asked him to answer categorically yes or no whether he once became an American citizen.“I wish I could answer that question with a yes or no, but as directly as I could in answering that question, I have always admitted that I was granted US citizenship. That’s my answer,” Yasay said.“I was granted US citizenship [on] Nov. 26, 1986, but it’s my position that that grant of US citizenship at that time was void,” he added.Yasay held that he was “ineligible and disqualified” to become a US citizen because he had no intention to reside in the United States, a view that he stated in an affidavit that he handed to Sato after the initial hearing on Feb. 22.On Wednesday, he told the lawmakers that his US citizenship was void because the US Immigration and Nationality Act “provides that anyone who has preconceived intent to abandon his residency at the time of application is disqualified to that grant.”“Am I to believe you can lose [your] American citizenship by your own personal preconceived intention that you will not permanently reside in the US?” Sato asked Yasay, reminding him that he swore allegiance to the United States when he took his oath as a US citizen.“For lack of a better term, you fooled the USA when you applied for citizenship with a preconceived intention not to reside permanently in the US and abandon your citizenship in that country. Were you truthful in your oath [to] that country?” Sato asked.Replying, Yasay admitted there was a “misrepresentation on my part for not divulging that.”Vote to rejectSan Juan Rep. Ronaldo Zamora moved to end the questioning of Yasay, and the 15 committee members withdrew behind closed doors to vote whether to reject or confirm his nomination.Later, on the floor, Lacson announced the body’s unanimous decision to reject Yasay’s nomination.“Let this be a reminder to everyone present in this hall, that by definition, an oath is a solemn declaration, accompanied by a swearing to God or a revered person or thing, that one’s statement is true or that one will be bound to a promise,” Lacson said.“The person making the oath invites punishment if the statement is untrue or the promise is broken. The legal effect of an oath is to subject the person to penalties for perjury if the testimony is false,” he said.",1

"Beware of the “toxic whispers of deception,” Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David warned, adding that under a climate of impunity prevailing in the country these days, whispers have gained the power to kill.“It takes just a [police] asset’s whisper to lead the death squads to their targets,” David said on Saturday at the Philippine Conference on New Evangelization (PCNE).“It takes just one neighbor’s whisper to get the whole barangay conditioned into accepting that killings are justified,” David told thousands of PCNE attendees at the University of Santo Tomas.On Thursday, the Caloocan bishop slammed the death squads behind the latest killings in his diocese, which included Jennifer Taburada, a widow who had led a support group for families of victims of extrajudicial killings.David said it was being spread in whispers in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan, that the widow had it coming, as she supposedly had a relationship with a drug peddler to support the needs of her two children—Princess, 13, and Prince, 11. Taburada’s husband, Ryan, was killed by vigilantes last year.Name on watch list“If looks can kill, whispers can kill, too. Nowadays, it takes just a whisper to put a name on the drug watch list,” he said.David said “deceptive whispers” were being used “to condition people into believing that the priests who were murdered recently got what they deserved.”In May, President Duterte presented a matrix, which claimed that Fr. Mark Ventura, who was shot dead by gunmen right after celebrating Mass in Gattaran town, Cagayan province, had illicit affairs with at least eight women. The President claimed that the women were the “wives, daughters and paramours of big-time businessmen and politicians.”“Murder is murder, whatever the motive was behind Ventura’s killing,” David said, adding that people who knew Ventura had vouched for his integrity.Fox as exampleThe bishop also cited the impending deportation of Australian missionary Sister Patricia Fox that, he said, was based on whispers that she was supporting leftist groups out to destabilize the government.The imposition of martial law in Mindanao, David said, was being justified as well by whispers that terrorists were plotting to overthrow the government.To counter such dangerous whispers, David urged the public to emulate the ways of Jesus and Mary who spread “life-giving whispers.”“The next time you engage in whispering, stop for a while and ask which template you are following—the serpent’s toxic whisper or Mary’s and Jesus’ life-giving whisper? It’s okay to whisper, just make sure you follow the right template,” he said.",1
"Iranian protesters attacked police stations late into the night on Monday, killing at least 13 people as security forces struggled to contain the boldest challenge to the clerical leadership since unrest in 2009.Videos on social media showed an intense clash in the central town of Qahderijan between security forces and protesters who were trying to occupy a police station, which was partially set ablaze. There were unconfirmed reports of several casualties among demonstrators.In the western city of Kermanshah, protesters set fire to a traffic police post, but no one was hurt in the incident, Mehr news agency said.Demonstrations continued for a fifth day. Some 13 people were reported killed on Sunday in the worst wave of unrest since crowds took to the streets in 2009 to condemn the re-election of then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.The protests have put pressure on the clerical leaders in power since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. President Hassan Rouhani made a televised call for calm on Sunday, saying Iranians had the right to criticize but must not cause unrest.In the central city of Najafabad, a demonstrator opened fire on police with a hunting rifle, killing one and wounding three others, state television said.Earlier, state TV said armed demonstrators on Sunday had tried to seize police and military bases but were stopped by “strong resistance from security forces.” It gave no further details and there was no independent confirmation.State TV had reported that 10 people were killed in protests on Sunday. On Monday, that death toll rose when the deputy governor of the western Hamadan Province, Saeed Shahrokhi, told ISNA news agency that another three protesters were killed on Sunday in the city of Tuyserkan.Hundreds have been arrested, according to officials and social media. Online video showed police in the capital Tehran firing water cannon to disperse demonstrators, in footage said to have been filmed on Sunday.Protests against economic hardships and alleged corruption erupted in Iran’s second city of Mashhad on Thursday and escalated across the country into calls for the religious establishment to step down.Some of the anger was directed at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, breaking a taboo surrounding the man who has been supreme leader of Iran since 1989.“The government will show no tolerance for those who damage public property, violate public order and create unrest in society,” Rouhani said in his address on Sunday.Unsigned statements on social media urged Iranians to continue to demonstrate in 50 towns and cities.The government said it was temporarily restricting access to the Telegram messaging app and Instagram. There were reports that internet mobile access was blocked in some areas.",1
"Natural-born Filipinos who lost their Filipino citizenship through naturalization in a foreign country may re-acquire Philippine citizenship by virtue of Republic Act 9225. Re-acquiring Philippine citizenship under the said law does not require a person to renounce allegiance to any other country.Dual citizens enjoy many benefits including the right to own real estate in the Philippines.Now, in an unprecedented move never before seen in the international community, the Philippines is offering triple citizenship under Republic Act 9994.In addition to being both a Filipino citizen and a citizen of the foreign country in which he or she has been naturalized, dual citizens can now enjoy the benefits of senior citizenship.From free movies to discounts at restaurants, hotels, supermarkets and transportation venues, senior citizens can now enjoy the fruits of their hard work.

"THE SUPREME Court on Tuesday ordered the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to issue voting receipts as a verification mechanism for the electorate in the May 9 elections, the first time the poll body was compelled to issue printouts of voters’ choices since automated counting in the country began in 2010.In a unanimous ruling, the high court ordered the Comelec to use the voter verification paper audit trail in voting machines, which will issue a receipt to each voter after casting his or her ballot.The ruling came just two months before Election Day.“The Commission on Elections is ordered to enable the vote verification feature of the vote-counting machines, which prints the voter’s choices,” the high court said in the dispositive portion of its ruling.All 14 justices present at Tuesday’s en banc session issued the order in granting the mandamus petition that senatorial candidate Richard Gordon and his party Bagumbayan-VNP Movement Inc., filed on Feb. 22, which said that such “physical record” of a voter’s selections was necessary to ensure a transparent and credible election.Only Associate Justice Arturo Brion was unable to vote as he was on leave.In its decision, the high court said the Comelec may issue “guidelines to regulate the release and disposal of the issued receipts to ensure a clean, honest and orderly elections,” including mechanics on the storage of receipts.To stay in precinctThe court said the poll body should ensure that “after voter verification, receipts should be deposited in a separate ballot box and not taken out of the precinct.”The high court has yet to release the full ruling and only came out with the dispositive part of the decision at a press briefing Tuesday.The Comelec was unable to answer Gordon’s petition as it missed the inextendible Feb. 29 deadline within which to respond. The high court last week junked the poll body’s plea for additional time.The poll body had decided against using the verification mechanism, saying it might extend voting hours and the receipts might be used in the illegal practice of vote-buying.In his plea, Gordon said the receipts were necessary to give voters “the opportunity to verify that the choices indicated on the paper record correspond to the choices that the voter has made in casting the ballot.”Reacting to the Supreme Court decision, Gordon said the ruling was not just his victory, but that of the citizens whose votes would be a lot safer now.“Democracy and transparency won today,” he said a statement. “The vote is a little bit more protected now. They have a piece of paper now to show their choices,” he said in a separate phone interview.The people now have a better chance of having clean, honest and credible elections.“Thanks to the Supreme Court, which is truly the last bastion of justice and democracy. The decision demonstrated that government agencies, like the Comelec, will never be allowed to run roughshod over people’s rights and will never get away with flagrant violations of the country’s laws,” he said.",1
"Communist rebels waging one of Asia’s longest insurgencies said on Tuesday that a peace pact was likely not achievable before 2019, in a blow to the Philippine government’s hopes of securing a deal this year.Ahead of fresh peace talks starting in Italy on Thursday, the communist-led National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) also warned that its forces on the ground were urging an end to a ceasefire as they had become frustrated with the government’s “broken promises.”“The NDFP goes into the third round of formal talks in Rome determined as always to persevere with the peace talks but increasingly troubled bythe other party’s sincerity,” the communists’ chief negotiator, Fidel Agcaoili, said in a statement.National democracyThe communists have been waging their “national democratic revolution” since 1968 to overthrow a capitalist system that has created one of Asia’s biggest rich-poor divides.At least 30,000 people have died in the conflict, according to the military.President Duterte, who describes himself as a socialist, has made ending the rebellion one of his top priorities.In a statement on the Jan. 19-25 talks in Rome, presidential peace adviser Jesus Dureza said Mr. Duterte “instructed the government panel to work for an early settlement of the issues as he calls on the nation to provide support to the efforts to ultimately bring peace in the land.”Mr. Duterte launched the peace process soon after he took office in June last year and installed three communists in his Cabinet.Temporary ceasefireBoth sides agreed to a temporary ceasefire during the first round of talks in Norway last August. The talks are being facilitated by the Norwegian government.The Philippine government said then it was aiming for afinal peace deal within 12 months.But Agcaoili said the communists would need at least two more years after negotiators agreed on a series of economic and political reforms before even beginning “serious discussions” on a final peace pact.Those economic and political reforms have yet to be agreed, and are meant to be discussed in Rome.Charter referendumAgcaoili told the Inquirer that there could be a referendum on a new Constitution that would incorporate the changes toward a federal form of government with all the safeguards on civil liberties, national sovereignty and against political dynasties.He said a final peace agreement would be signed once these things were in place.Familiar grievances that derailed peace efforts under previous Presidents appear to have returned to haunt the current negotiations.The communists have long demanded that hundreds of jailed communists be released before they will consider making major concessions in the talks.Mr. Duterte released 18 top leaders to kickstart the peace process but the communists, are demanding another 434 rebels be freed immediately.Last month, the President said he did not want to release the rebels straight away, describing the negotiations as a “poker game.”Aces in prison“My aces are in prison,” he said, referring to the jailed communists. “If I released themall my cards would be lost. There would be nothing else to talk about.”The government’s chief negotiator, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello, gave a more upbeat assessment of the peace process.He told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Tuesday that the government was still sticking to its time frame to secure a peace deal of between nine and 12 months from the start of the talks in August last year.Bello said he had told the communists it was to their advantage not to delay, or they would risk not being able to finalize a peace pact before Mr. Duterte’s six-year term ended in 2022.In his statement, Dureza was more cautious, saying the government “views with optimism, although with managed expectations, positive outcomes in the forthcoming resumption of peace negotiations.”Peace talks agendaHe said the talks “hope to tackle the still unfinished discussions” on a proposed bilateral ceasefire and the releases of prisoners.Also to be discussed are socioeconomic reforms, constitutional and political reforms, end of hostilities and disposition of forces, he said.“These issues, although difficult, are surmountable with both sides sharing common aspirations for peace,” Dureza said.Agcaoili said the prospect of a permanent ceasefire was “growing dim” because of the prisoner issue. He also accused security forces of violating the current temporary ceasefire.But Bello said he would still push for agreement on a permanent ceasefire.“The prisoners’ issue has no bearing on the signing of a bilateral ceasefire,” he said.The government estimates the communist New People’s Army (NPA) has about 4,000 fighters, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s.But the NPA remains particularly active in rural areas of the archipelago, where its fighters are well known for extorting money from local businesses. Their regular deadly attacks on police and military forces also occasionally reach into urban areas.In 2002, the US Department of State designated the Communist Party of the Philippines and the NPA foreign terrorist organizations.",1

"The House of Representatives on Tuesday adopted constituent assembly (Con-ass) as the mode for amending the 1987 Constitution for a switch to federalism.By a voice vote, the 293-member chamber approved Concurrent Resolution No. 9 “to constitute the Congress of the Philippines as a constituent assembly for the purpose of proposing amendments to, or revision of, the 1987 Constitution.”Lawmakers from the Makabayan bloc led by Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao and ACT Teachers Rep. Antonio Tinio tried to stop the vote and loudly voiced objections.But the presiding officer, Deputy Speaker Gwendolyn Garcia, dismissed the objections and put the measure to a vote.The ayes drowned out the nays, though a considerable number of lawmakers also voted in the negative.Lawmakers foreverEarlier on Tuesday, a number of House leaders tried to clear the way for limitless terms for members of the envisioned parliament in the proposed federal government.Among the proponents is the chair of the House constitutional amendments committee, who opened discussions on a draft Constitution that is based on the output of four subcommittees that have consolidated federal models in the past several weeks.The panel headed by Southern Leyte Rep. Roger Mercado began debating the salient features of the subcommittees’ proposals that borrowed from models suggested by the PDP-Laban Federalism Institute and Resolution of Both Houses No. 8, a draft Constitution proposed by two House members.A final draft of the proposed Constitution will be submitted to Congress once it sits as a Con-ass.The subcommittees recommended that the President, along with members of parliament, be given a five-year term with one reelection, serving no more than two consecutive terms.But the discussion set off proposals from members of the House panel to do away with term limits altogether.Contentious debateDavao Oriental Rep. Corazon Nuñez-Malanyaon, who headed a subcommittee on government structure, said there was a contentious debate among the members during the deliberation on term limits.“I remember there was a heated discussion on this. There were those proposing there should be no term limits while others wanted only two consecutive terms,” she said.To which Ako Bicol Rep. Rodel Batocabe objected: “What [do we] fear? What is the thing we would like to avoid?”Mercado, the committee chair, said: “[Nothing]. It’s just that based on our experience, there was a time our elected officials with terms of four years had no term limit. Here we are now to make proposals for consequent amendments in order that these things be reconciled.”He then said he was in favor of dispensing with term limits for lawmakers.Quirino Rep. Dakila Carlo Cua, chair of the House ways and means committee, agreed, saying he, too, believed term limits should be removed.At present, House members have three-year terms and are allowed no more than three consecutive terms, while senators who serve six years are limited to two successive terms.Alejano not comfortableIn a press briefing, Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano said he was not comfortable with the proposal.“We all know that the faces of politicians are all the same … No term limit is good if the people elect only those who are qualified, but our people are still far from that stage,” he said.“I really don’t know how this will work because the likely scenario is that politicians will be in power until [they die],” Alejano said.Ifugao Rep. Teddy Baguilat Jr. said he was open to discussing the prospect of doing away with term limits with the caveat that such a provision should not benefit incumbents.“It should be made clear that this [would] not apply to us,” he said.",1
"The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and the China Coast Guard (CCG) will implement an agreement establishing the Joint Coast Guard Committee (JGCC) for maritime cooperation between them.The agreement was signed on October 20, 2016 and witnessed by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.Felipe Judan, Department of Transportation undersecretary for the maritime sector, in his keynote address during the inaugural meeting between the PCG and the CCG last month, said mutual understanding, cooperation and friendship between the two coast guards would contribute to further strengthening of bilateral relations between Manila and Beijing.At the inaugural meeting, both sides recognized the significance of coast guard diplomacy.The JCGC adopted implementing guidelines of the agreement and the Terms of Reference of working groups put up to assist in the work of the committee.Both sides agreed to cooperate on preventing and combating drug trafficking and other transnational crimes and on search and rescue (SAR), environment protection and emergency response through, among other modalities, information exchange and pragmatic empowerment activities unique for the PCG and the CCG and enforcement agencies.They also established a hotline to facilitate communications in agreed areas of cooperation.Both sides agreed too to conduct bilateral exchange activities in 2017, including high-level visits, maritime operations and related exercises, vessel visits and capacity-building.The CCG invited PCG officials to visit China at an appropriate time this year.",1
"BAGUIO CITY– This city has recorded a downtrend in the number of young mothers in the last three years, city health officer Dr. Rowena Galpo said Tuesday.Galpo said that in 2015, they have recorded 610 young mothers, aged 15 to 19, who gave birth in the city. In 2016, the figure went down to 578 and in 2017, there were 327. The numbers represented that of actual residents of Baguio.Based on the 2017 national teen pregnancy statistics, the Cordillera region ranked second with the least number of teen pregnancies. This was an improvement from the 2013 survey, when Cordillera topped the list of regions with the most number of teenage mothers. Baguio city accounted for most of the incidence.Galpo said following the 2013 survey and to address the problem, the city mayor issued an administrative order creating the adolescent and youth development council composed of various government and non-government agencies.The council, she said, trains health staff to handle adolescent fertility cases and also upgrades barangay health centers into adolescent-friendly facilities to make them a “tambayan” of teenagers. There are also adolescent reproductive health programs now institutionalized, which include distribution of contraceptives to teenagers, especially those engaged in sexual activities.She however reiterated that while contraceptives are available, they are promoting abstinence as the best method of preventing teenage pregnancy.Marlene de Castro, Executive Director of the over 30-year old Baguio Center for Young Adults (BCYA) that focuses its programs on improving the life skills of young people, said the continuing consolidated effort of various sectors could have contributed to the decreasing trend in teen pregnancies in Baguio.She mentioned information and education campaign in different schools that focuses on delayed sexual debut, promotion of Reproductive Health and the availability of “condoms”.She also mentioned the establishment of friendly health service facilities.De Castro said there is a continuing challenge to make teen moms abstain and delay further sexual activities through follow-up interventions and family planning programs.“We are hoping to prevent young mothers from becoming recidivist teen moms,” she said.Bernardina Tabin, assistant local civil registry (LCR) in the city, said there were 9,867 live births registered with their office in 2017. Out of the number, 966 were born of teen mothers aged 15 to 19 years old. This number included those from out of town, who gave birth in the city.Dr. Maria Alice Torres, who handles the city health office’s maternal and neonatal child health and nutrition, said the city’s programs is focused on making the youth shy away from sexual activity at a young age. She explained that the risk is high for young mothers to develop hypertension, aside from having premature labor.“Their uterus are not yet matured and has difficulty to hold on to enlarging fetus,” she said.She also said that the youngest so far to give birth in the city is 13 years old.In a study conducted by the Philippine Population Institute of the Philippines and Demographic Research Development Foundation in 2013, it was found that one in every Filipina teen aged 15 to 19 are already mothers. About 2.6 percent of Filipina teens with the same age had become pregnant with their first child while 13.6 percent have begun childbearing.",1
"Malacañang is pleased that former Palawan Governor Joel Reyes is back in police custody following his surrender to the Sandiganbayan last Monday.The anti-graft court earlier cancelled Reyes’ bail and ordered his arrest in connection with graft conviction for a mining permit case.“Very good.

"thanks to 30 million Filipinos who have Internet access, not to mention multiple email accounts. That’s almost a third of the Philippines’ total population of about 100 million.The Miss Universe organization knows how passionate Filipinos are when it comes to their beauty queens and that they will do everything they can to ensure their candidate’s victory. The organization, however, feels that online voting results may not totally reflect the true merits of the competition, equating the results to a “hometown decision.”Because of this, the Miss Universe organization announced that the Philippines has been banned from online voting in this year’s pageant to be held November 9 in Moscow, Russia. It said Internet votes emanating from the Philippines will be automatically blocked.The announcement angered Filipino netizens who felt that the ban would diminish the chances of the Philippine candidate, Ariella Arida, in winning the Miss Photogenic or fan favorite award.Despite the ban, beauty pageant experts and enthusiasts have placed Miss Arida in the initial circle of favorites to win the title, which would potentially give the Philippines its third major beauty title this year, following the victories of Megan Young as Miss World and Johanna Datul as Miss Supranational for 2013.",0
"Police have stepped up their hunt for suspects in the massacre of a family of five in San Jose del Monte City Tuesday morning.Sr. Supt. Romeo M. Caramat Jr., acting Bulacan police chief said Wednesday a Special Investigation Task Group has been organized to focus on the case.Estrella Carlos Dizon, 35, her children Donny, 11; Ella, 7, and Dexter Carlos Jr., 1 year old, her 58-year-old mother Auring Dizon, were found dead with stab wounds in their house in North Ridge Royal Subdivision, Barangay Sto Cristo, San Jose Del Monte City.Caramat said he was instructed by Gov. Wilhelmino M. Sy-Alvarado to step up the manhunt for the suspect or suspects in the massacre.Alvarado also offered a R100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the suspect or suspects.“Justice must be served immediately for the victims of this gruesome crime. This senseless killing must not go unpunished,” he said.Earlier, San Jose Del Monte police chief Supt. Fitz Macariola announced that Mayor Arthur Robes had put up R100,000 as a reward.Macariola also said investigators have invited several persons of interest for questioning.Police learned that Dexter Carlos Jr., the husband of Estrella, arrived in their house at around 8:45 a.m. Tuesday after working the night shift as a security guard in Makati City.When no one responded to his call to open the gate, Carlos climbed over it. From a small opening he saw his mother-in-law sprawled on the floor inside the house, lifeless and without lower garments.Carlos ran to the back of the house where he found the naked and lifeless body of his wife.When Carlos got inside he found his three children locked up in a room, all dead.Macariola said Estrella and her mother could have been raped.As of Wednesday afternoon, police had ruled out robbery as a motive in the killings. Macariola was waiting for the result of the examination carried by a scene-of-the-crime team from the Bulacan PNP Crime Laboratory.There were no signs that the killer forced his way into house.",1
"There were no fireworks at President-elect Rodrigo Duterte’s victory party on Saturday, as pyrotechnics are banned in Davao City. But who needed them when Duterte himself was there?“You sons of bitches, I will really kill you,” Duterte warned drug dealers in a speech to 200,000 supporters celebrating his electoral victory at Crocodile Park.The crowd cheered as the first expletive of the evening exploded from the mouth of the trash-talking city mayor, who will be inaugurated as the Philippines’ 16th President on June 30.“If you destroy my country, I will kill you. If you destroy the youth, I will kill you,” Duterte warned drug dealers, drawing more cheers from his supporters who started gathering at the park at 1 p.m. to hear him.He aired the same warning during the campaign, and it helped him win the votes of 16.6 million Filipinos fed up with rampant crime in the country.On Saturday night, he restated his anticrime program, encouraging the public to help him fight criminals and urging armed citizens to shoot and kill drug dealers who would resist arrest and fight back in their neighborhoods.“Please feel free to call us, the police, or do it yourselves if you have guns, you have my support,” Duterte said.He warned about an extensive illegal drugs trade in the country that involved even police.If a drug dealer would resist arrest or refuse to be taken to a police station and would threaten a citizen with a gun or a knife, “you can kill him,” Duterte said.“Shoot and I’ll give you a medal,” he added.Bounty raisedEarlier, Duterte announced bounties of P3 million for drug bosses.On Saturday, he announced that he was raising the bounty to P5 million for every drug boss. “But he has to be dead,” he said.He also offered smaller bounties for drug dealers down the rung of crime syndicates.Duterte also asked three police directors based at Philippine National Police headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, to resign for involvement in crimes that he did not specify.He threatened to humiliate the three police officials in public if they did not quit. He did not disclose their names, though.Duterte said dismissed cases against policemen would be reviewed to flush out law enforcers who get away by disappearing until there were no more witnesses against them and asking judges to dismiss the cases against them.Clean up PNPIn Quezon City, Chief Supt. Wilben Mayor, spokesperson for the PNP, said the police supported Duterte’s anticrime program and assured the President-elect that there was no place for rogue policemen in the service.“We will work hand in hand with the incoming administration to strengthen and enhance this policy and ensure that those involved will be prosecuted and separated from the service,” Mayor said.Malacañang said it was the prerogative of the incoming President to clean up the PNP but reminded Duterte that even the war against drugs and corrupt policemen required due process.“Any action against corruption needs to follow due process in accordance with law,” Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said on state-run radio.Duterte also cited corruption in public education, the sector that receives the largest chunk of the national budget.Problem with K-12“But there’s a problem now, there’s an aberration created by K-12,” he said, referring to the Aquino administration’s flagship program that added two years to the basic education cycle to meet international standards.He said many parents could not afford the additional burden and thousands of teachers were “marginalized” by the new system.Duterte promised to build more schools.“If there are 35-50 students in a barangay, then you will have a national high school. No need to walk 20 to 30 kilometers to go to school. I will bring the school to your place,” he said.UnderspendingDuterte also said he expected government agencies to fully spend their budgets, a dig at the outgoing Aquino administration’s underspending that slows down economic growth.“Use it all up. Whether you underspend or overspend, it means there was corruption. If you spend less, it means you did not do your job. At the end of the day, when there’s an audit, there shouldn’t be an expense of a peso more or a peso less,” he said.“If you spent more, you’re stupid. If you spent less, you’re also stupid,” he added.Losses from corruptionAs for money, he said the government would have all the money it needed if only it would get all the taxes collected.But, he said, the government loses P300 million a day because of corruption at the Bureau of Customs.The government loses another P200 a day—a “very conservative” estimate—because of corruption at the Bureau of Internal Revenue, he said.He said the losses at the customs bureau could be used for land reform.The money, he said, could be used to finance the acquisition of land for the beneficiaries of the land reform program. It could also be used to buy farm implements, fertilizers and other equipment needed by farmers.Duterte also hit out at crop conversion for the benefit of multinational companies.“We have a problem with rice. We have given so much to the multinationals. They are planting banana, pineapple, coffee, and it is a corporate endeavor that only big firms can afford,” he said. “So we have run out of land to plant [rice].”Duterte also promised to make health his “No.1 priority.”“I will commit all the earnings of Pagcor (Philippine Gaming Corp.), which run into billions, to hospitals for medicines and hospitalization,” he said, drawing applause from the crowd.

"The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has released guidelines for the distribution of cash assistance, worth P5,000, for families displaced from the predominantly Muslim city of Marawi which has been besieged by a terror group since May 23.In a statement on Wednesday, Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo said the assistance would be released in two tranches. The first will be distributed earlier to help families observing Ramadan to procure appropriate food for the month-long religious holiday and the second will help in transportation costs.“We have decided to provide each affected family with P1,000 apart from the family food packs and all the other food donations that we are receiving on their behalf. The families can use the money to buy food that is more suitable for them when they break their fast at sunset,” Taguiwalo said.During Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. The DSWD, in its statement, recognized that the usual contents of their family food packs—six kilos of rice, three cans of corned beef, three cans of sardines, and six packs of ready-to-drink coffee—are not suitable for the Muslim holiday.“As for the remaining P4,000, it will be released to each family when it is already safe for them to return to Marawi. We are also preparing other actions to help them when they resume their lives in their communities—other DSWD programs will be made accessible to them,” Taguiwalo added.",1

"The United States Congress may not have the guts to ban assault weapons — thanks to the powerful gun lobby (NRA) — but it doesn’t have any problem outlawing selfie sticks because of “security concerns.”A selfie stick is an extendable monopod used to take photographs by clamping a cell phone on the far end of the device, allowing the user to capture special moments and a wider view that otherwise wouldn’t be possible because of the normal short range of the arm.Theme parks such as Walt Disney World Resort and Six Flags already ban selfie sticks for safety reasons while some sports and concert venues prohibit their use for “nuisance” issues and for interfering with other spectators’ enjoyment or view.A group of Republican congressmen have taken the issue several steps forward by drafting a bill that would completely ban the use of selfie sticks in all public venues in America including zoos, parks, concert halls and sports stadiums. It will also make it illegal to have a selfie stick in carry-on luggages on airplanes, trains and buses.“Selfie sticks are deadly as baseball bats,” one GOP congressman told The Adobo Chronicles, “and we owe it to our citizens to ensure that they are protected from unscrupulous individuals who may use the device to kill or injure someone in moments of rage or mental instability.”The proposed bill, which has the backing of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, directs the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to come up with licensing procedures and strict regulations limiting the possession and use of selfie sticks to proven responsible citizens with above-average IQ, no criminal records, and no unpaid back taxes.",0

That crown, of course, belongs to the real winner, Miss Philippines Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach.But lo and behold, Gutierrez may get to wear the crown in the near future and keep it until the next Miss Universe is chosen.The reason? Wurtzbach is dating People magazine’s “sexiest doctor alive,” Mikhail Varshavski. The couple confirmed in their respective social media accounts that they are, indeed, seeing each other. In fact, Wurtzbach changed her Facebook profile to “In a relationship.”Remember, the official rules of the Miss Universe Pageant, one of which says that “if for any reason the new Miss Universe cannot fulfill her obligations, the first runner-up will become Miss Universe.?” That first runner-up would, of course, be Gutierrez.So Gutierrez is hoping that Wurtzbach and Varshavski decide to get married soon which would then disqualify the Filipina beauty from continuing her reign.

"proximity to or identification with the President (or his or her political party or allies) appears to be the dominant consideration, not the applicant’s judicial thoughts or philosophy.President Arroyo personally knew me when she appointed me to the court as I sat in her cabinet as her labor secretary. In varying degrees, she also knew or had links with her other appointees. In the case of President Duterte, media was rife with speculations that his first two appointments to the court would come from his alma mater, San Beda. This expectation did indeed come to pass. His appointees, of course, are both worthy and well qualified for the position of associate justice.As a result perhaps of this peculiarity in the Philippine appointment process, our justices are not identified with any clear judicial philosophy or ideology and no clear ideological delineation exists in the court among the justices. If the justices’ voting inclinations can be forecast at all, the identification is confined to specific cases or issues rather than to the justices’ general liberal or conservative views. For this reason, it was not unusual to hear me speak out on the controversial aspects of constitutional, labor and ethics cases as these had been my special interests while I was with the court.Two SC positions will soon be vacated by the retirement of JJ. Bienvenido Reyes (in July, 2017) and Jose Mendoza (in August, 2017). The media and the rumor mills shall also soon be abuzz with speculations on who will replace them. People should realize though that, as in the past, exposure to the court’s adjudicative tasks has its way of changing a new justice’s approaches and outlooks; only time will tell how these appointees will handle the cases and issues that will confront them in court.Another dimension of a new appointment is the effect the newcomer will have on internal relationships within the court, a matter largely outside the public’s view but which is, nevertheless, a very real influencing factor in the court’s operations and decision making. Issues such as the loss of the court’s vote on SC applicants, developments similar to Jardeleza, as well as the uneven treatment of justices, leave marks that can lead to informal alignments as effective as the liberal and conservative divide. Again, only time will tell how the Court leadership will handle these submerged realities.jadb.legalfront.mb@gmail.com.",1
"Patrol boats of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources have practically been abandoned due to poor maintenance while some are being misused for tourism purposes to the consternation of the Commission on Audit (COA).In its 2017 annual audit report for BFAR, COA chided the agency for maintaining poorly its patrol boats which are supposed to be utilized for surveillance of fishing activities in the country.COA asked BFAR to address the problem by conducting periodic monitoring of the local government units’ use of patrol boats and provide adequate budget for the immediate repair of the deteriorated units.State auditors disclosed that 14 Fisheries Management patrol vessels for monitoring, control and surveillance, seven had non-operational navigational and communications equipment.Procured in 2001, the boats’ current state threaten the safety of BFAR personnel who are assigned to conduct and monitor surveillance operations in the high seas.“Any distress signals cannot be received/sent as the VHF/UHF all mode transceivers were not operational. In case the operating auxiliary machinery had bogged down during the operations, their mission will not be pursued as there were no available units available,” auditors reported.COA also pointed out that the failure to spend on the boats’ maintenance would only put to waste the loan payments made by the government.The status of 43 patrol boats purchased from 2009 to 2011 have also been assessed as auditors stressed that this has been procured under the United States’ Public Law 480 program.It was gathered that US funded the acquisition of the boats for the purpose of aiding the local government units’ food security.However, five of these boats were used for tourism activities, aside from their original purpose of enforcing fishery laws and conducting coastal resource management activities. The COA did not identify which LGUs had misused the boats.Auditors said this was “contrary” to the memorandum of agreement’s provision requiring the beneficiary LGUs to use the boats “exclusively” for activities related to fishery laws, coastal resource management and disaster relief operations.It was also discovered that the problems with four LGUs— Dipaculao, Aurora; Alegria, Cebu; Badian, Cebu; and Tagum City, Davao del Norte— is that they could not use the boats for the intended purpose due to lack of funding for operation and maintenance.The Dipaculao and the Alegria municipal governments even turned over the boats to the Aurora Pacific Economic Zone and Freeport and the Cebu provincial government since they could not be used.",1

"The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Thursday urged communist rebels to accept the proposed localized peace talks because this is their last chance to peace.“The important thing here is this is an offer that we are providinag to them. It’s an offer, so it’s a matter of take it or leave it,” Col. Edgard Arevalo, Armed Forces spokesman, said.He insisted that the localized peace talks would succeed “despite what the communists are claiming that they are divided on this issue because [the localized peace talks] will not necessitate that we will have to talk with the commanders themselves or any of them in a higher level or upper echelon.”Arevalo lamented that the government had done its best in talking peace with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), New Peoples’ Army and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP).“We have tried many times but failed as many times as well. We have observed these, and we have validated this many, many times that they do not really mean peace,” he added.Should the communist rebels not accept the localized talks, Arevalo said they would have to flex their muscles against the NPA rebels.He boasted that 7,416 NPA rebels have surrendered to the government.Those who surrendered would be enlisted under the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP), a government program for the former rebels. Under the program, former rebels will be given protection for three years by the AFP, P15,000 cash, livelihood assistance worth P50,000, and firearms renumeration of between P45,000 to P90,000.President Rodrigo Duterte had set conditions for the peace talks to continue. He said peace talks should be held in the Philippines, a move opposed by self-exiled Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria “Joma” Sison.",1
"Alarmed by the “increasingly visible human footprint” on climate change, a House of Representatives leader is considering filing a “carbon tax bill” that would curb carbon emissions, and allocate funds for the development of renewable energy (RE) sources.Camarines Sur Rep. Luis Raymund Villafuerte, chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, cited the need for Congress to pass new legislation that would help curb global warming, citing increasing evidence of man-made climate change.“The President’s new stand on climate change is a clear signal for the Congress to move ahead with the approval of laws that would penalize man-made carbon dioxide emissions through taxation,” he said.“This is one of the most viable measures that would accomplish a two-pronged goal: First, help the country comply with its international commitments to curb global warming; and second, fund clean energy production processes,” he added.Presidente Duterte finally decided to honor the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, which came into force on Nov. 4.Some 200 countries committed to significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to keep global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius.Citing the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report at the recent international climate change talks in Morocco, Villafuerte noted that 2011 to 2015 was the hottest five-year period on record, and that evidence show the cause of such extremely high temperatures was man-made.He asked the Duterte administration to consider imposing a carbon tax and include its imposition in its multi-year comprehensive tax program, the first package of which was already endorsed to the Senate and the House of Representatives last September.Villafurte said he is planning to file the carbon tax bill, but he would first weigh the pros and cons of such measure and its impact on developing economies like the Philippines.",1

"After three emotion-filled hearings, the Senate committee investigating the proliferation of fake news on the Internet concluded its proceedings today by declaring the Philippine Daily Inquirer and Rappler as sources of fake news.Committee Chair Senator Grace Poe announced that she and her colleagues have come to this conclusion after resource persons invited to testify at the hearings presented uncontestable evidence to prove that the two news sources are perfect examples of fake news.Among the evidence provided to the Senate committee included Inquirer’s ‘killing’ of Indonesian death row inmate, Filipina Mary Jane Veloso who was convicted of drug charges. Inquirer reported that she was executed, but Veloso remains alive to this day.Also presented was Rappler’s Pia Ranada’s report that President Duterte had appointed Nikki Prieto-Teodoro as the new DSWD Secretary to replace Judy Taguiwalo whose appointment was rejected by Congress.In her concluding statement, Poe thanked the resource persons for their truthfulness and courage in helping the committee get to the bottom of fake news on social and mainstream media.All’s well that ends well.",0
"even expressing willingness to cut short his tenure in office in the event that a new Constitution is ratified that would usher in a new and better system of government,” he said.“The remarks, therefore, of Mr. Jose Ma. Sison that PRRD would declare a nationwide martial law to ensure his stay in power is downright ludicrous,” he said.Panelo bewailed that Sison has raised the “martial law bogey” for more than a year now as part of his psywar campaign against the Duterte administration. Sison is the founding chair of the Communist Party of the Philippines.“All his forecasts have fallen flat on the ground. This just shows that Mr. Sison, who has spent almost three decades of high living in Europe, simply lost his marbles and is already out-of-touch of the political realities in the Philippines,” he said.He also reminded Sison that martial law could be proclaimed only when the conditions outlined by the Constitution.“President Duterte has articulated in numerous occasions that he would not impose martial rule unless so required by the command of the Constitution,” he said.Panelo said Sison has also lost the leadership of the communist cadre amid the suspension of the peace talks.He noted that the rebel group’s hardcore leaders have not enforced the pre-conditions agreed upon for the resumption of peace negotiations.“With the lack of support from these leaders who are now woke of their unfair relationship with him, he is now left with just issuing rehash statements from the safe and comfortable environment of his exile,” he added.President Duterte placed Mindanao under martial law on May 23, 2017 following the attack of the Maute terror group in Marawi City. The martial law proclamation has been extended until the end of the year to suppress lawless violence and rebellion in Mindanao.The military is expected to start to assess the Mindanao situation to determine if it will recommend the lifting or extension of the martial law in the south.",1
"Satisfaction with how democracy works in the country declined in June, nine months after it reached its highest level, according to a recent Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey.The majority (61 percent) of Filipinos also prefer a democratic over an authoritarian form of government, the survey says.In face-to-face interviews, 80 percent of 1,200 adult respondents nationwide expressed satisfaction with the country’s democracy, down 6 percent from its highest level of 86 percent in September 2016.The survey, conducted from June 23 to 30, also found that 61 percent preferred democracy over any other form of government, while nearly one in every five (19 percent) said that “under some circumstances, an authoritarian government can be preferable to a democratic one.”Another fifth of the respondents said it did not matter whether the country had a democratic or a non-democratic regime.People’s preference between democracy and authoritarianism is a different issue from the degree of satisfaction with how democracy works, and is probed by a separate question, according to SWS.The independent survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.Satisfaction with the country’s democracy was also variously recorded at 70 percent in October 1992 and July 1998, and 68 percent in June 2010. SWS said the surveys followed the presidential elections of 1992, 1998 and 2010.The result of the latest survey actually matched the 80 percent recorded in June 2013 following the May 2013 senatorial elections. Satisfaction with democracy was among its lowest, at 44 percent, in June shortly after that year’s presidential election.SWS said the democracy rating had been over 60 percent since June 2010. In 31 surveys between October 1999 and June 2009, however, it went beyond 50 percent twice.The term “satisfaction in the way democracy works” originated from the Eurobarometer surveys and is also used in Latin American and Asian barometer projects, according to SWS.The results of the 2017 Eurobarometer survey of 28 European Union member states showed an average of 55 percent of Europeans were satisfied with the way democracy worked in the European Union.",1

"Typhoons and flooding as a result of climate change will damage more houses in the Philippines by 2085 as seven cities are seen vulnerable to the rise in sea levels, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Friday.In a report, the Manila-based multilateral lender warned that unabated climate change will “severely affect future growth, reverse current development gains, and degrade quality of life” in the region, citing the results of its new joint report with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) titled “A Region at Risk: The Human Dimensions of Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific.”In the case of the Philippines, the cities of Butuan, Davao, Iloilo, Caloocan, Malabon, Manila and Taguig will be most exposed to one-meter sea-level rise, the ADB said in a fact sheet, citing that “coastal and low-lying areas in the region will be at an increased risk of flooding.”“Losses from tropical cyclones in the Asia and the Pacific by 2085 include a 17-58 percent increase in direct housing damage in the Philippines if no adaptive measures are taken,” the ADB added.According to the ADB, “more intense typhoons and tropical cyclones are expected to hit Asia and the Pacific with rising global mean temperatures.”In the report, the ADB noted that “the Philippines is particularly vulnerable to natural hazards,” which usually results into migration.Citing recent studies, “natural disasters are expected to cause further displacement from rural to urban areas, as has already occurred in the past,” the ADB said, although “displacement after natural disasters in the Philippines is usually localized as people want to stay as close to their homes as possible.”Including the rest of Southeast Asia, the region was “projected to be one of the most affected regions by heat extremes,” according to the ADB.“Southeast Asia is particularly vulnerable to flooding, since there is a concentration of low-lying populated deltas. Already, the number of record-breaking rainfall events has significantly increased over the last decades.,” the ADB said.",1

" The wife of Puerto Princesa Vice Mayor Luis Marcaida III said the illegal drugs and firearms found in their house by police during Monday’s raid might have been planted by unknown suspects.Following the arrest of her husband, Luis, on Monday morning, Monette Marcaida said the evidence might have been left by four armed men who barged into their house around 3:30 a.m., or right before the raiding team arrived.“They told us to lie down. They were wearing bonnets. That was before the village captain and the media were there,” a tearful Monette told reporters.She said the unidentified men forcibly entered the house and herded them to the second floor where they were told to lie face down on the floor.The vice mayor was arrested at his house in Barangay Bancao-Bancao early on Monday in a raid led by Supt. Enrico Rigor of the Philippine National Police Drug Enforcement Group (PNP-DEG).The raiding team was armed with a search warrant issued by Judge Reynaldo Alhambra, executive judge of the Manila Regional Trial Court.Found in the house were 30 sachets of suspected “shabu” (crystal meth) hidden behind Marcaida’s portrait on the ground floor.Rigor denied Monette’s claim, saying the team arrived in the house around 4 a.m. to serve the warrant on Marcaida.“If there is only a security camera (that could have recorded the events), that would help us know if the allegations are true or not,” Rigor said.In a press conference following the raid, Rigor said that aside from the packs of shabu, the police team also found a .22 caliber rifle, a .38 caliber revolver, three rifle grenades, a fragmentation grenade, 5.56 mm ammunition, four .45 caliber pistols and magazines.Also retrieved was a box purportedly containing P280,000 in cash and a piece of paper that had the name of a judge and another person Rigor identified as a Mr. So. Rigor did not identify the judge.Rigor said the note indicated payments of P35,000 that were supposed to be made to the judge and a separate payment of P50,000 to So.“Instinct reveals that we have to investigate this (payments) further,” the police officer said.Rigor said his team would question the people linked to the money found in the vice mayor’s possession.Supt. Ronnie Bacuel, officer in charge of the Puerto Princesa City police, said Marcaida was a “high-value target” on the regional PNP’s drug list.Marcaida is involved in a legal dispute with Mayor Lucilo Bayron over the city’s mayoral post arising from a dismissal case against the latter. The case is pending in the Office of the Ombudsman.",1
"(First of three parts)Sicogon, an island in Iloilo province, was not the popular tourist destination it once was in the late 1970s and early 1980s.But to property developer Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and landowner Sicogon Development Corp. (Sideco), the island had the makings of a world-class tourist destination with one hitch: 334.6 hectares of Sicogon were still classified as agricultural and occupied by 216 agrarian reform beneficiaries.A settlement with the farmers in 2014 allowed the two companies to get the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to approve the conversion of the property to nonagricultural use on May 29, 2016, the waning days of the Aquino administration.As a result, the island is now being developed into a commercial and tourism hot spot of hotels, malls and residences, complete with a 1.2-kilometer airstrip.Sicogon is just one example of converted agricultural lands that have since been turned into bustling hubs of activity, whether they be for residential, commercial, industrial or institutional purposes.Between 1988, when the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) took effect, and 2016, a total of 97,592.5 hectares of agricultural land—the size of Metro Manila and Cebu City—were approved for conversion to nonagricultural purposes, according to the DAR.The figure does not include pending applications for conversion, agricultural land reclassified by local government units and illegally converted land.The rampant conversion of prime agricultural land, partly driven by rapid urbanization, population growth and speculation, has led to conflicting land uses.Two-year banThe DAR hopes to address the problem when it proposed a two-year ban on the processing of applications for land conversions last September.If Malacañang approves the ban, the DAR will review all conversion applications made from June 15, 1988, to June 30, 2016, to account for “rampant and unchecked conversions of prime agricultural lands,” states a copy of the second draft executive order.The ban would apply to all awarded lands under Republic Act No. 6657, or CARL, and other similar laws, according to Agrarian Reform Secretary Rafael Mariano.“Essentially, the moratorium seeks to determine the status of agricultural lands, whether they have been developed according to their five-year development plan and its impact on agricultural production,” Mariano said.Under CARL, land reform beneficiaries or landowners can apply for the conversion of agricultural lands into other uses if after the lapse of five years from its award the land stops being economically viable, or the area has become urbanized, and the land will have a higher economic value for residential, commercial or industrial purposes.Of the approved conversion applications in DAR regional offices over the past 28 years, 80.6 percent of the land is in Luzon, with the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon (Calabarzon) that lie on the fringes of Metro Manila, taking up more than a quarter of the total. The Visayas accounted for 7.8 percent and Mindanao, 11.6 percent.DAR regional offices approved a total of 40,308.8 ha while the national office approved 57,283.7 ha. Regional offices handle conversion applications involving 5 ha and below, while the national office handles applications involving more than 5 ha.Calabarzon and Central Luzon produce big volumes of palay and other crops, lending credence to fears that conversion of prime agricultural lands could undermine food security.Urbanization, population growthThe Philippines has roughly 30 million ha of land, of which 9.7 million are considered agricultural.Rapid urbanization and population growth are major drivers of land conversion, according to Agrarian Undersecretary Luis Pañgulayan.The need for housing and employment as well as the need to spur economic growth and investments have led the state to tolerate massive conversion of agricultural lands into other uses outside Metro Manila.Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Bulacan provinces all posted higher population growth rates than Metro Manila and the country between 1990 and 2015, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).Satellite images of Metro Manila from 1988 to 2014 also showed that the urban sprawl nearly doubled. Built-up areas, or intensive-use lands that are mostly covered by structures, extended from 424 square kilometers to 704 sq km, well into bedroom communities, such as Bacoor City (Cavite); San Pedro City (Laguna); San Mateo, Taytay and Antipolo City (Rizal); and Marilao in Bulacan.Bacoor’s population rose 276 percent between 1990 and 2015; Sta. Rosa’s by 273 percent; San Mateo’s by 207 percent; and Marilao’s by 293 percent, PSA data show.Incidentally, the provinces surrounding or near the capital have the highest land conversion rates since 1988.Such was the case with Batangas province, where the DAR approved on Feb. 1, 2016, the conversion of 27 ha as additional area for a solar farm in Calatagan town. Solar Philippines Commercial Rooftop Projects now has the largest solar farm in the country with 160 ha, on which rice, corn and other crops used to be planted.Urban land constraintsAn expected surge in conversion applications in the Visayas and Mindanao as they, too, become more urbanized, was also key to his decision to propose the ban, Mariano said.The DAR noted that Negros Occidental and Misamis Oriental, known for vast sugarcane and coconut plantations, respectively, were among the top 10 provinces with the biggest number of conversions.If not properly addressed, the rapid urbanization across the country could pose major challenges to land management and economic growth.This could lead to “congestion diseconomies” in which a lack of coordination between urban growth and land development could drive prices of land and demand for housing higher, according to a study on urban land constraints by Makiko Watanabe, senior social development specialist at the World Bank.Watanabe presented the study at a conference on sustainable land governance in Manila on Feb. 8.Agrarian reform beneficiariesIn Sicogon, the farmers, who initially opposed the joint venture project of ALI and Sideco, relented after their homes were destroyed in 2013 by Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan).The agrarian reform beneficiaries entered into a compromise deal with ALI and Sideco in November 2014. The companies agreed to set aside P114 million for resettlement housing on a 30-ha property and livelihood projects, and donated 40 ha for “scientific” farming.It is cases like this that the DAR would like to reevaluate should a conversion moratorium push through.Mariano said his office would create a task force to spearhead a program review, monitor the lands of approved conversions and determine whether any of these need to be revoked. It would also seek out each farmer-beneficiary to ask the all-important question: Did their lives improve?Pañgulayan said that over the course of CARL, 4.7 million ha of land had been awarded to 2.7 million farmers. “The question of Secretary Mariano is where are these beneficiaries now? Are they still tilling the soil?” he said.“Historically, the farmers have paid for the land that they are supposed to get now. They shed blood, sweat and tears for the land through generations,” Pañgulayan said. “It belongs to them.”",1

"DELIVERIES of merchandise to shopping malls during the Christmas season will only be allowed from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. as the government seeks to address traffic problems that tend to escalate during Yuletide.The new circular takes effect November 1 to December 31.Thomas Orbos, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) officer-in-charge and general manager, issued Memorandum Circular 16 series of 2016 (MC 16-2016) dated October 27 directing shopping mall operators to conduct deliveries only from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.Perishable goods such as food and ice cream are exempted from the delivery rule.MC 16-2016 noted the need “to implement effective and sustainable measures to effectively address the expected traffic problems during the Christmas season for the convenience of the public.”Mall operators are also instructed to submit traffic management plans to the MMDA for mall sales and promotional events two weeks before the scheduled event.Starting November 1, mall-wide sales during weekdays are prohibited but sales at certain department stores and store outlets inside the malls may be allowed “but it must not be without announcement, advertisement or tarpaulin.”Shopping malls must also adjust their operating hours to between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. starting November 1, an hour later than the regular open hours of 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.Besides the regulation of mall deliveries and operating hours, the no-window hour policy under the Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program, or the number coding scheme, takes effect on November 2.Coding hours will run from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and cover more areas, which include all radial roads (R1 to R10) and circumferential roads (C1 to C6) in Metro Manila, as well as Alabang-Zapote Road in Muntinlupa City and Samson Road and A.

"The number of maritime kidnappings hit a 10-year high in 2016, with waters off the southern Philippines becoming increasingly dangerous, the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) said on Tuesday.While the overall number of pirate attacks has declined in recent years, the IMB said 62 people worldwide were kidnapped for ransom at sea last year compared with only 19 in 2015 and nine in 2014.“The kidnapping of crew from ocean-going merchant vessels in the Sulu Sea and their transfer to the southern Philippines represents a notable escalation in attacks,” the IMB said in a report.Avoid Sulu SeaIt urged shipowners to avoid the Sulu Sea, which lies between eastern Malaysia and the Philippines, by routing ships to the west of Borneo island.In a string of incidents in the Sulu Sea last year, groups of armed men said to be either from or linked to the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group ambushed ships and seized crew for ransom.The Abu Sayyaf group is based on remote and mountainous southern Philippine islands.Their leaders have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) jihadi group in Iraq and Syria, but analysts say they are more focused on lucrative kidnappings.Noel Choong, head of the IMB’s Kuala Lumpur-based Piracy Reporting Center, said groups linked to terrorists were carrying out the kidnappings, particularly off West Africa and in the Sulu Sea.Attacks fallDespite the rise in kidnappings, the number of overall pirate attacks continued to fall due to better policing and ships taking more precautions.A total of 191 cases of piracy on the high seas were recorded in 2016 compared with 246 in 2015.World piracy has been on the decline since 2012 after international naval patrols were launched off East Africa in response to a spate of violent assaults by Somali-based pirates and others.The number of cases has also plummeted off Indonesia thanks to more efficient patrols.“The continued fall in piracy is good news but certain shipping routes remain dangerous, and the escalation of crew kidnapping is a worrying trend in some emerging areas,” said Pottengal Mukundan, director of IMB.Kidnap hot spotsIn addition to the Sulu Sea, the Gulf of Guinea was a kidnap hot spot, with 34 crew taken in nine incidents last year.The number of all pirate attacks off Nigeria rose from 14 in 2015 to 36 last year.Peru, which had a clean sheet in 2015, saw 11 pirate incidents last year, 10 of them at its main port of Callao.",1
"Despite a court-ordered freeze on his bank accounts, which seems to bolster the corruption allegations against him, Vice President Jejomar Binay on Sunday said he would still run for president in 2016 because it would be risky to entrust the Philippines to leaders “without experience and competence.”Binay was obviously referring to Senator Grace Poe whose popularity with voters has put her at the head of the Aquino administration’s search for a presidential candidate in next year’s elections.President Aquino and Poe met two weeks ago to discuss the senator’s role in the elections. On Saturday, Poe, who topped the 2013 senatorial election, said she was looking up to the President for guidance in her role in shaping the future of the Philippines.In a statement issued on Sunday, Binay said he wanted to “bring experience and competence” to the national leadership.Binay told The Adobo Chronicles that the female senator is not fit to be president because “she has no experience in graft and corruption, money laundering, illegal transactions and other qualifications presidential hopefuls should have.” “The people’s choice for the next president is clear; Binay is the guy,” he added.",0
"“Principle.” A fairly simple word, isn’t it. Three syllables and about nine letters long. However, what’s sad is that it’s meaning is lost on a lot of us Filipinos. Thing is, it may sound simple but to put it into practice is something else entirely.So just what are “principles”?Well, to have principles means sticking to one’s guns. It means that when you make a decision, you’ll stick with it to the end and if you make any mistakes, you’ll own up to them when called out on it. It also means that when you find yourself in an advantageous position but think you did not earn it fairly, you will willingly give it up because you know for yourself that you did not deserve it.Principles also tie in with one’s sense of honor. Having a sound set of principles and following them through regardless of your situation, marks one as truly honorable. For instance, you find yourself competing in a contest that you soon realize is rigged, instead of continuing and winning, you either stop playing or, even when you do win, you step down and declare that you are unworthy of the title. Alternatively, if you play for a team in a competition and your team loses, you congratulate the other team and stick with yours until perhaps eventually, you manage to secure a win.Unfortunately, the idea of principles and the way they’re supposed to work in this country is entirely a different story. Like everything else, from concepts, to actual objects and people, everything is tainted with the dysfunction of our culture. It’s why we all too often end up with avaricious religions, twisted ideologies, tyrannical authority figures and, of course, people who can’t even be taught to follow simple instructions and cry like babies when called out on it.Now we have a vice president who seems too afraid to stick to her guns. Did she cheat her way to her title? Well, that’s not for me to judge. However, given the questionable way her votes seemed to fluctuate throughout the election process, the suspicion of electoral fraud does indeed have some basis. Unfortunately, her utter refusal to allow for any recount pretty much sums up the kind of person she is. So it doesn’t matter if you cheated as long as you win, eh? It doesn’t matter if you come off as a possible pawn of an elitist political faction as long as your opponents don’t win, eh? It doesn’t matter if said elitist political faction is a staunch opponent of the man you married as long as you get what you want, eh?Then we have this boxer-turned congressman-turned senator who says he was with the upcoming president all along. Yes, this is the same guy who approved the BBL and then changed his mind later when he actually read the thing and realized that it included one of the places he governed over. You know, for all your Bible-thumping and attacking the LGBT community, you never seem to bother with the wisdom written in the Good Book, do you? It’s always about convenience with you, isn’t it? When you want to shirk your political duties, you say you have practice and when sportsmen want to examine you for fairness, you up and say you have political duties?",0
"The prosecution asked the Sandiganbayan’s First Division has to reconsider its ruling dismissing the graft case filed against former Pampanga Gov. Manuel “Lito” Lapid and several others in connection with the alleged anomalous purchase of fertilizers in 2004.The court on September 30, 2016 threw out the case because of the “unjustified” delay in the investigation of the case by the Office of the Ombudsman.But the prosecution said the time consumed to investigate the complaint was “reasonable.”“With all due respect, the Honorable Court erred in its finding that accused Lapid, Aquino-Abubakar, Aquino and Vasquez’s constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases have been violated,” the prosecution said in an 11-page motion for reconsideration.Lapid’s petition to dismiss the case was adopted by private respondents Ma. Victoria Aquino-Abubakar, Leolita Aquino, and Dexter Alexander Vasquez.The anti-graft court was urged to give particular regard to the facts and circumstances peculiar to the case.“Fertilizer scam cases consist of complex issues, voluminous documents, various respondents and various witnesses mostly of poor farmers, where tedious investigative efforts were applied in the immediate disposition of the preliminary investigation of these cases,” the prosecution pointed out.According to the court, the Office of the Ombudsman’s preliminary investigation took three years and a month. The complaint was filed in 2011 but a case was only filed against Lapid and the other respondents last year.In dismissing the complaint, the Sandiganyan said ”no plausible explanation was given to justify the delay” in the investigation.In its motion for reconsideration, the prosecution said: “Extraordinary complication should have been considered such as the degree of difficulty of the questions involved, several number of accused and witnesses offering evidence of anomaly, coupled with the several extensions filed by them are events that effectively stymied the normal work activity or disposition of these cases. To be exact, the last pleading filed by the accused was in July 2014. The Information was filed on 04 November 2015.”“Based on records, accused were given ample time to refute the complaint against them. Despite the original period given to file their appropriate pleadings several extensions were asked and given to them by the Office of the Ombudsman. Such that, to fault the Office of the Ombudsman and include the period spent for the allowance on extensions asked to file their counter-affidavit and other several motions for the production of documents and the like is unfair for the prosecution,” it added.State prosecutors also dismissed as unfounded the claim of Lapid, Aquino-Abubakar, Aquino, and Vasquez that their right to speedy trial was violated.“It was not shown how they suffered from the alleged violation of their right to speedy disposition of the case. Their claim is baseless and, to our mind, completely imaginary,” they said.“As regards the Honorable Court’s ruling that the delay is prejudicial since the defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately the events of the distant past, it must be stated that both the accused and the prosecution stand equally prejudiced if their material witnesses cannot be located or fail to remember the relevant events as a result of further delays in trying these cases,” the prosecution added.The Ombudsman had alleged that the fertilizer was purchased without public bidding and that procurement rules were violated when direct purchasing was resorted to “despite the availability of a suitable substitute offered at a much lower price in the locality.”The fertilizer was allegedly sold at P1,250 per liter when its real value was supposedly only P150 per liter, according to the Ombudsman.",1
"Count them as papal blessings.This year’s Catholic Mass Media Awards (CMMA) anniversary on Wednesday savored the memory of Pope Francis as many of the winning stories in different mass media categories centered on his phenomenal visit to the Philippines in January.One of the five awards garnered by the Inquirer during the 37th CMMA ceremonies was best news coverage for the newspaper’s reportage of the fourth papal visit in the Philippines.The CMMA cited the awardees in the print category for having “the most inspired and thought-provoking images, stories, essays and articles that have moved and possibly changed many lives for the better.”Francis’ visit was the first major news event this year that the Inquirer covered in full force, with its different platforms delivering an integrated report.The Inquirer reportorial team for the visit included Lito B. Zulueta, TJ Burgonio, Christian V. Esguerra, DJ Yap, Leila B. Salaverria, Jocelyn R. Uy, Tina G. Santos, Nestor P. Burgos Jr., Connie E. Fernandez and the Inquirer Visayas Bureau.3 other finalistsZulueta, Inquirer Lifestyle editor for arts and books, was the only Filipino print media representative on the papal plane, Shepherd One. He was with the Vatican Press Corps throughout the Asian tour.The Inquirer coverage of the Pope’s visit to the Philippines bested three other finalists in the best news coverage category. One of the finalists was another Inquirer entry, the coverage of the so-called Benhur Luy Files by Nancy C. Carvajal.Carvajal’s work featured articles on the documents submitted to the Senate blue ribbon committee by the National Bureau of Investigation in the committee’s probe into the pork barrel scam.Top news photographOther Inquirer awardees include photographer Lyn Rillon, who won the top award in the news photograph category for her work “Wall of Hope.”“Wall of Hope” refers to the colorful therapeutic wall mural that adorns the lobby of Philippine Children’s Medical Center in Quezon City, where kids at the outpatient department wait for treatment.Seven of the eight other finalists in the news photograph category were all from the Inquirer.Rillon was also nominated for her “Real Men Do Cry,” while Raffy Lerma was a finalist for his photos, “Dark Day” and “Sign of Independence.”Also named finalists in the same category were Joan Bondoc for her “Bringing Light to Darkness” and “Fathers’ First Embrace”; Niño Jesus Orbeta for “Sleeping it Off,” and Rem Zamora for his photo, “As Far As the Eyes Can See.”Other Inquirer winners“The Peacemakers,” a special report on peace initiatives in conflict-torn Mindanao by Fernando del Mundo, chief of the Inquirer investigative team, bested four other finalists in the best special feature category.The Inquirer’s Gilbert Daroy was unopposed in the best editorial cartoon category. He won the top prize for his work, “Pope Francis breaks the ice between the United States’ Obama and Cuba’s Castro.”Daroy’s other work, “Justice Secretary De Lima’s Dilemma on Napoles Affidavit Implicating Senators and Congressmen,” was also nominated as a finalist.Queena Lee-Chua’s “All in the Family” column in the Inquirer tied with Francis Kong’s “Business Matters” column in the Philippine Star for the top prize in the best business column category.Inquirer columnist Randy David’s “Public Lives” was one of the five finalists in the best opinion column category.Pope John Paul II awardThe CMMA Pope John Paul II Award was given to the Papal Committee on Documentation and Coverage.That award, named after Pope John Paul II, who was renowned as a great communicator, was given to a group or a person who utilized the mass media in promoting evangelical service.“The Varsitarian,” official student publication of the University of Santo Tomas, won a special citation for its special edition on Pope Francis’ apostolic and state visit to the Philippines.According to the Varsitarian website, the special issue featured articles putting the papal visit in historical context and discussing the significance of Francis’ rise to the See of Peter. The graphic-rich publication also outlined preparations made by the university, the Church and the government for the visit.TV specialsRival networks ABS-CBN and GMA 7 also received awards for their papal visit coverages.GMA 7 won the best special event coverage award for its “Ang People’s Pope Sa Pilipinas,” while ABS-CBN News DocuCentral received special citations.ABS-CBN’s “Ako at ang Santo Papa” received the citation for TV special.DocuCentral’s “Ang Mabuting Pastol: Pope Francis sa Pilipinas” shared the special citation for TV special coverage with “Thank You sa Malasakit: Pope Francis sa Pilipinas,” ABS-CBN’s marathon coverage of the visit.‘God’s good news’The theme for this year’s CMMA is “Communicating the Family: A Privileged Place of Encounter with the Gift of Love” based on the message of Pope Francis for World Communications Day on Jan. 24.During the award ceremonies, Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle urged members of Filipino families to communicate with one another.“Let us not wait for tragedy to strike. In our everyday existence, let us communicate to one another. Let us communicate to our members of the family. Tell them ‘You are good news. You may not be perfect, we are all wounded in this family but you are God’s good news to us,’” Tagle said.284 finalistsFor this year’s 37th Catholic Mass Media Awards, the CMMA Foundation received a total number of 803 entries in 60 mass media categories in print, radio, television, advertising, music, the Internet and student CMMA.Of these, 284 made it as finalists.The CMMA was established in 1978 by the late Jaime Cardinal Sin, then archbishop of Manila, as the means by which the Church pays tribute to those who “serve God by means of the mass media.”Other awardees for the papal visit include ABS-CBN’s TV ad on the apostolic visit titled, “Thank You sa Malasakit, Pope Francis,” which won best public service TV ad.The song “We Are All God’s Children,” the official theme of the papal visit sung by Jamie Rivera got back-to-back awards—best inspirational song and best music video.

"Restoring the death penalty remains a priority of the Duterte administration, despite the Vatican’s pronouncement that it is “inadmissible” in any circumstance.“It is still a priority of this administration to restore the death penalty for serious, drug-related offenses,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a press briefing on Friday, a day after Pope Francis approved a change in Catholic catechism that had previously accepted capital punishment as a “last recourse … [to] effectively defend human lives against the unjust aggressor.”The new teaching in Catechism No. 2267 now says there are other ways to protect the common good, and that the Church should commit itself to working to end capital punishment.According to the new text, “the Church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person.”The Church acknowledged that it had “long considered recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority and following a fair trial … an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.”But it added that “[t]oday, there is increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes.”Pope Francis has long opposed the death penalty, saying that the execution of a human being is fundamentally against the teachings of Christ because, by definition, it excludes the possibility of redemption.Feeds vengeance“It doesn’t give justice to victims, but it feeds vengeance,” the Pope said in June 2016, arguing that the biblical commandment “thou shall not kill” applies to the innocent as well as the guilty.The death penalty was abolished in the Philippines in 2006 but President Duterte has been actively pushing for its restoration despite resistance from the Senate.Roque said the decision now lay with the Senate, but that the President would try “gentle persuasion” to convince the lawmakers of the need for the death penalty.In a text message to reporters on Friday, Senate President Vicente Sotto III said he would “try to find some kind of a compromise,” to convince his colleagues to support the death penalty bill.Sotto earlier said senators would be more likely to support the bill if the death penalty only targeted high-level drug traffickers.But in a separate message to reporters, former Senate President and Duterte party mate Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III categorically said the Senate “won’t reimpose the law.”Sen. Francis Pangilinan, meanwhile, reiterated the stand of the Liberal Party (LP) in opposing the restoration of the death penalty.“We do not see it as a deterrent to crime,” the LP president said.Heinous crimesThe Senate seemed “somewhat divided on the issue,” Sen. Sonny Angara said.Although the House passed a bill reviving the death penalty for major drug offenses in March 2017, it has remained at the committee level in the Senate.At the House of Representatives, Buhay Rep. Lito Atienza said he “welcomes the Pope’s pronouncement,” and hoped the government would stop pushing for the return of capital punishment.Allowing the death penalty violates the Constitution and the government’s treaties with the United Nations, Atienza said, adding that proponents of capital punishment “transcended God who created human life.”Under the 1987 Constitution, the death penalty shall not be imposed but Congress may pass a law prescribing death for heinous crimes.The Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country, has a history of invoking and suspending capital punishment.Four months after the declaration of martial law in September 1972, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos ordered the execution of notorious drug lord Lim Seng to serve, Marcos said, as a deterrent against the growing drug menace.Between 1946 and 1965—the year when Marcos became President—35 people were executed for crimes committed with “senseless depravity” or “extreme criminal perversity.”From 1971 to 1972, several laws were passed and presidential decrees issued that made hijacking, drug offenses, car theft, subversion, illegal possession of firearms, arson, embezzlement and illegal fishing capital crimes.In 1987, former President Corazon Aquino abolished the death penalty “unless for compelling reasons involving heinous crimes, [and] Congress hereafter provides for it.”Lethal injectionIn 1993, Congress passed Republic Act (RA) No. 7659, which reimposed capital punishment. The law was amended in 1996, prescribing lethal injection for those convicted of heinous crimes.Between 1999 and 2000 during the term of then President Joseph Estrada, seven inmates were put to death as part of the administration’s anticrime drive.In June 2006, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed RA 9346 and abolished the death penalty, saying it had not proven to be a deterrent to crime.Although more than two-thirds of countries around the world have abolished or suspended judicial killings, the human rights organization Amnesty International has recorded at least 2,591 death sentences in 53 countries and nearly 1,000 executions in 2017 alone, excluding those unreported in China.",1
"‘Pagss cargo company, “a comprehensive cargo handling and storage service company established in 1987. This company, second only in size to Miascor, has an extensive warehouse space for cargo storage, professionalized handling services, and a full component of customs personnel, with highly competent and personalized service.”PAGSS President Janet Cordero dismissed the Miascor employees’ allegations. “I don’t want to comment, we want to concentrate now on our work.”Luigi Avancena, Miascor consultant, said the company has been given an extension until April 15 this year to close its ground-handling service, from the original deadline of March 31.He said the Miascor management is talking to other ground-handling services to accept some of the soon-to-be dismissed employees. He said the other ground service providers are: Dnata, Skylogistics, Macro Asia, and PairPagss.”“Miascor continues some of the remaining services such as catering, mechanic, airline services, and several more,” Avancena added.He said the company continues to offer below–and above–the wing services. Its core businesses are in ground handling, cargo handling and warehousing, and in-flight catering.The company’s portfolio also includes a wide range of ancillary services such as fixed base operations (FBO), into-plane refueling, manpower deployment, general sales agency (GSA), and training.Although Miascor would not give its actual number of employees, airport sources said it has about to 8,000 to 9,000 personnel, with about 40 airline clients.“It is currently the leading aviation services company in terms of market share for its passenger, ramp handling, and in-flight catering services.”",1
"After leading other Duterte supporters in “slut-shaming” Sen. Leila de Lima for her affair with her driver during a House hearing in November, House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez now finds himself the target of irate netizens and possible disbarment for his very public extramarital relationship.Even the most popular teleserye was sidelined this week when House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez justified his philandering with quotes that would be remembered long after he exits the political arena.“Eh sino ba ang walang girlfriend?” he said in one interview. “Hindi ko ’yan tinatago. Kahit si President Duterte inanounce ’yan sa China (Well, who doesn’t have a girlfriend. I’m not hiding it. Even President Duterte announced it during his China visit).”Alvarez, 59, is married to Emelita Apostol Alvarez, the current head of the Congressional Spouses Foundation (which also made news recently when the Speaker asked the group to vacate the House complex, citing lack of space).The official, a staunch Duterte ally, has long been estranged from the mother of his four children. He also admitted having sired eight children in all, two of them from a first marriage, and two from other partners.Alvarez, a lawyer, expressed readiness as well to face a disbarment case arising from his extramarital relationship.“Go ahead, no problem with me,” he said when reminded that he could get delisted from the roll of attorneys.On Friday, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) issued a statement reminding lawyers to maintain “the highest standards of morality, behavior and professionalism.”“As members of a noble profession and as officers of the court, lawyers are held to a higher standard than most and these standards are seriously enforced by the Supreme Court and by the IBP as the mandatory organization of lawyers,” the IBP statement read.Due processIf a disbarment case should be filed against Alvarez, the IBP assured that he would “be granted the full measure of his right to due process but these shall be the same standards against which his actions shall be measured.”Alvarez could be disbarred for violating Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which prohibits lawyers from engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct; and Rule 7.03 of Canon 7 of the same Code, which prohibits them from engaging in any conduct that adversely reflects on their fitness to practice law.The Code also forbids them, whether in public or private life, from behaving in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession.The Speaker could also be penalized or dismissed from office under Article 334 of the Revised Penal Code, which states that “a husband who committed concubinage, or keeping a mistress in the conjugal dwelling, having sexual intercourse, under scandalous circumstances, with a woman not his wife, or cohabiting with her in any other place, shall be punished by prision correccional in its minimum and medium periods.” This means a prison term of from 6 months and one day, up to 4 years and 2 months.In a Supreme Court decision in 2003, a man having an illicit relationship with a woman not his wife was, within the purview of Section 46(b)(5) of Subtitle A, Title I, Book V of Executive Order No. 292 or Administrative Code of 1987, (engaged in) a “disgraceful and immoral conduct.”Under Rule IV, Section 52A(15) of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, an immoral conduct is classified as a grave offense which calls for a penalty of suspension for six months and one day, to one year for the first offense. A second offense can mean dismissal from office.Irate postsAside from possible disbarment and dismissal from office, Alvarez has been the subject of irate posts on social media as netizens recalled him leading other Duterte supporters in “slut-shaming” Sen. Leila de Lima for her extramarital affair with her driver, Ronnie Dayan, during the House hearing on the senator’s alleged drug links.“Here is a woman pretending to be clean, pretending to be a crime-buster, a graft-buster, a self-proclaimed righteous individual—we need to show the people her true character,” Alvarez said of De Lima last November.The Speaker, however, denied being selective in his stand on morality. “I castigated her for her involvement in drugs and not for her love life,” he said of the De Lima hearing.Netizens also castigated Alvarez for saying his extramarital affair did not cost the government anything.Pictures of him with his girlfriend, since identified as Jennifer Maliwanag Vicencio, inside a chartered plane with other Duterte officials, soon flooded social media, with netizens asking: “Who’s spending for her fare on this official trip?”Others snarled: “So this is where our taxes go!?”AltercationThe Speaker’s complicated love life surfaced when, early this week, he filed a complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman against longtime friend and patron, Davao del Norte Rep. Antonio Floirendo Jr., saying that his family corporation had benefitted—to the government’s disadvantage—from a 25-year lease of over 5,000 hectares from the Bureau of Corrections.The estate is used as a banana plantation by the Floirendo-owned Tagum Agricultural Development Company, Inc.In response, Floirendo’s girlfriend, Cathy Binag, said the Floirendo-Alvarez feud started at the Masskara Festival in Bacolod City late last year when she had an altercation with Vicencio.Binag, who manages a restaurant in Davao City, identified Vicencio as Alvarez’ mistress.Since being named however, Vicencio has “disappeared” from Facebook, having changed her name. But photos of herself, her children, and the supposed “powder room of her mansion” can still be viewed under the names of her Facebook friends. The photo was posted in 2013.",1

"A week after typhoon “Ompong” (international name: Mangkhut) tore through the country, 11 roads in five provinces remained closed to traffic as the cost of damage to public infrastructure reached P2.74 billion.The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) noted this on Friday as it recommended to President Rodrigo Duterte the declaration of a state of calamity in four regions battered by Ompong.The President’s declaration is needed to trigger measures that would keep prices of basic goods low in the affected areas and make available to the country a standby World Bank loan facility for rehabilitation efforts.National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) Undersecretary Adoracion Navarro told a press conference on Friday that the NDRRMC backed the government economic team’s request to the President to declare a state of calamity in northern Luzon, Cagayan Valley, central Luzon and the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR).Latest tally: 95 deadIn its latest tally of Ompong-related casualties nationwide, the Philippine National Police recorded 95 deaths, 69 injured and 54 missing as of Friday.Most of the casualties were from CAR, the hardest-hit region where 79 people died, 42 were injured and 50 were missing.During the NDRRMC’s special meeting on Thursday, the council “established that conditions necessary for the declaration of a state of calamity in Regions 1, 2, 3 and CAR are present,” Navarro said.According to Navarro, two of five conditions must be met before a state of calamity can be declared. In the case of Ompong’s aftermath, four conditions were present, namely, impact on livelihood, infrastructure, crops, as well as disruption of power and water supply.The Department of Public Works and Highways said the 11 road sections would remain impassable to the public as clearing works were still ongoing.11 roads closedIn Benguet, roads still closed to traffic are Kennon Road, Baguio-Bontoc Road (Busa and Tiging sections), Baguio-Bua-Itogon Road (Sitio Goldfield and Sitio Kiangan sections), Acop-Kapangan-Kibungan-Bakun Road and sections of Banaue-Hungduan-Benguet Boundary Road.The Abra-Ilocos Norte Road in Abra and sections of the Apayao-Ilocos Norte Road in Apayao were also still closed to traffic.The Mount Province Boundary-Calanan-Pinukpuk-Abbut Road (Mabongis Bridge) and the Balbalan-Pinukpuk Road (Maling section) in Kalinga were still impassable while the Baliwag-Candaba-Sta. Ana Road (Bomba Bridge) and the Candaba-San Miguel Road have not been repaired or cleared of debris.The Department of Environment and Natural Resources warned on Friday that landslides could still happen in Itogon, Benguet, even with the halt in mining activities in the area.Environment Undersecretary Benny Antiporda said the site where the landslide occurred in Itogon was within a geohazard zone. He said the landslide could not have been caused by mining.Rescuers have recovered 46 bodies from the buried bunkhouses that had sheltered small-scale miners and their families. The bunkhouses were used by the mining company Benguet Corp. until 1991, when it stopped operations in the area.",1
"Goodbye metal fencing, hello glass walls: Paris authorities are building a permanent security belt around the Eiffel Tower, replacing the current fencing around it with more visually appealing glass walls.The company operating France’s most-visited monument says see-through panels are being set up at the north and south ends of the site. Each panel, made from over 6-centimeter (2.36-inch) thick armored glass, measures 3 meters (nearly 10 feet) high and weighs 1.5 tons.In all, 450 glass panels will compose the two walls north and south of the monument.Two graphic grids have been erected on the two other sides of the site and bollards against vehicle ramming attacks will be set up all around.French soldiers and police will keep patrolling outside and inside the area, as they have done since the deadly November 2015 attacks in the French capital.The glass walls being installed allow visitors to admire the views from the nearby Champ-de-Mars gardens to the other side of the Seine River that cuts through Paris.The renovation, which will also embellish the gardens beneath the tower, is part of a 300 million euro ($350 million) project announced last year to modernize the 129-year-old tower that has become the most recognized landmark in Paris.The security renovation should be completed by September.“When you are on site, you see that the 3-meter high walls, compared to the scale of the monument, are absolutely not visible,” said Jose Luis Fuentes, an architect at Dietmar Feichtinger Architects, which is in charge of the project. “It will really look as if the square (under the Eiffel Tower) was open.”Between 6 and 7 million people visit the Eiffel Tower every year.",1
"This ""open letter"" was found making the rounds on social media:* * *Dear Sirs:I just wanted to make some comments on the reporting of the CNN International crew here in Manila, regarding the relief efforts for the victims of super-typhoon Haiyan (which we locally call typhoon Yolanda).First, full disclosure: I am a retired Filipino executive and computer person. I was born in the Philippines and spent all my life here (save for some very short overseas stints connected with my career). I have worked with a large local Philippine utility, started up several entrepreneurial offshore software service companies (when outsourcing was not yet in vogue), and also served as the Philippine country head for a multi-billion dollar Japanese computer company. This diverse work background allows me to always see both the local and global point of view, and to see things from the very different standpoints of a third-world citizen, and a person familiar with first-world mindsets and lifestyles.I appreciate CNN's reporting, as it brings this sad news to all corners of the world, and in turn, that helps bring in much needed charity and aid. The tenor and tone of CNN's reporting has not been very palatable for a local person like me (the focus seems to be on the country's incompetence). But I shrug that aside, as there is probably some truth to that angle. And in reality, what counts now is that help arrives for the people who need them most; recriminations and blame can come later. Last night, I listened to a CNN reporter wondering about the absence of night flights in Tacloban, in the context of the government not doing enough to bring in relief goods. It was like listening to newbie executives from Tokyo, London or the USA with no real international experience, yet assuming that their country's rules and circumstances applied equally to the rest of the world. That was the proverbial last straw: I knew I had to react and call your attention to a few things (with some risk, since these topics are not my area of competence):1. The airport in Tacloban is a small provincial airport: when you get two commercial Airbus flights arriving simultaneously, you are already close to straining that airport's capacity. Even under normal operations, the last flights arrive in Tacloban at around 6pm, partly because of daylight limitations. Considering that the typhoon wiped out the airport and the air traffic gear, and killed most of the airport staff, you basically have nothing but an unlit runway which can handle only smaller turbo-prop planes. You can only do so much with that. I would assume that our Air Force pilots are already taking risks by doing landings at dusk. Take note that in the absence of any working infrastructure, the cargo will have to be off-loaded from the plane manually, while it sits in the tarmac. If you do the math, I wonder how aircraft turn-around's can be done in a day? How many tons of supplies could theoretically be handled in one day?2. The Philippine air force has only three C130 cargo planes (I am not sure if there is a fourth one). This is supposedly the best locally-available plane that is suited for this mission: large enough to carry major cargo load, but not too large to exceed the runway limitations. We do not have any large helicopters that can effectively move substantial cargo. I am happy to read in the newspapers that the USA is lending another eight C130 planes. I am not the expert, but I would suspect that even with more planes, the bottleneck would be in capacity of the airport to allow more planes to land and be offloaded, as discussed above.3. A major portion of the road from the Airport to Tacloban City is a narrow cement road of one lane in each direction. With debris, fallen trees, toppled electric poles, and even corpses littering the road, it took time to clear the airport itself, so that they could airlift heavy equipment needed to clear the roads. Then it took even more time to make the roads passable. Listening to our Interior Secretary on CNN, he disclosed that the Army was able to bring in 20 military trucks to Leyte. Half of them were allocated to transport relief goods to the different villages in the city, and the rest were assigned for clearing, rescue and other tasks. With very little local cargo trucks surviving the typhoon, I guess this would be another bottleneck. Again, I assume that if I do the math, there is only so much volume that can be moved daily from the airport to the city.4. The Philippines is an archipelago. Tacloban City is in Leyte island, which has no road link with the other major cities/islands. The only external land link (the San Juanico bridge) is with the neighboring island of Samar, which was equally hard hit by the typhoon, and which is just like Leyte (in terms of limited transportation infrastructure). The logistics of getting relief, supplies and equipment to Tacloban is daunting. Not too long ago, my company put up a large chunk of the communication backbone infrastructure in Leyte province. It was already a challenge to get equipment onto the ground then. This has always been the challenge of our geography and topography. What more now, when the transportation/communication systems are effectively wiped out in Tacloban?5. There is an alternate land/sea route from Manila to Leyte: down 600 kilometers through the Pan-Philippine highway to the small southern province of Sorsogon, taking a ferry to the island of Samar, and then 200+ kilometers of bad roads to Tacloban City. I was told that some private (non-government) donations are being transported by large trucks through this route. So many trucks are now idle in Matnog town down in Sorsogon, waiting for the lone ferry which can carry them across the very rough San Bernardino Straits to the town of Allen in Samar island. The sheer volume probably is over-whelming. Again I do not have the exact numbers, but my educated guess is that the low-volume Matnog ferry needs to transport in a few days what they would normally do over one or two months.6. The government administrative organization in Tacloban is gone. Most local government employees are victims themselves. This adds to the problems of organizing relief efforts locally. Even if augmented with external staff, the local knowledge and the local relationships are hard to replace. In some other smaller towns (where the death toll and/or damage has not been as bad), local governments are still somehow functioning and coping. They are able to bury their dead, set up temporary makeshift shelters, organize and police themselves. Short term, they need food, water and medical supplies to arrive; medium term, they need assistance in clean-up, reconstruction and rebuilding. But Tacloban is in a really bad condition. What can you expect from a city that has lost practically everything?I am told of the comparison with the Fukushima earthquake/tsunami, where relief supplies arrived promptly, efficiently, and in volume. I think there is one major backgrounder that CNN staff fail to mention: that Tacloban is not Fukushima, that it is not Atlanta. And the Philippines is not Japan, and certainly not the USA. Even before the typhoon, this region was one of the less developed in the country, with limited infrastructure. There was only a small airport, limited trucking capacity, a limited road system, and a small seaport servicing limited inter-island shipping. And with the damage from the typhoon, that limited infrastructure has been severely downgraded. It is easy to blame the typhoon. But the truth is: Tacloban is a small city in a third-world country. If you had to bring in that volume of cargo in that short window of time in pre-typhoon Tacloban, it would already have been a challenge. It is easy for a first-world person to take everything for granted. The reality (or sometimes, the advantage?) of growing up in a third-world country is that you do not assume anything, you take nothing for granted, you are grateful for what little you have (and you do not cry over what you do not have).I understand and sympathize with the desperate needs of the victims. Every little bit counts. The smallest food or water package can make the difference between life and death. I think every Filipino knows that. And that is why I am very happy with the national display of compassion and civic duty. Everyone, even the poorest, even the prison inmates, is donating food and money. People are volunteering their time. All the local corporations are helping. In the Philippines, Christmas is the most important holiday, and the annual company Christmas Party is probably the most important company event for most employees. Yet in very many companies in Manila, employees have decided to forego their Christmas party, and instead divert the party budget to relief/aid.From what I see on TV, the situation on the ground is not pretty. I do accept that efficiency needs to be improved, that service levels have to go up. I do acknowledge that our country's resources are limited, that our internal delivery capabilities may not be world-class. I do understand that there may be ineffective policies/processes and even wrong decisions made by government. But what I cannot understand is the negative tenor of CNN reporting. I suspect that CNN reporters are viewing this through the eyes of a first-world citizen, with an assumed framework of infrastructure and an expectation of certain service levels. I suspect these are expectations that we would have never met, even in the pre-typhoon days.Or perhaps it is a question of attitude: a half-empty glass rather than a half-full glass. At my age, I have experienced and lived through earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and at least twenty really bad typhoons (but admittedly, none as bad as Yolanda). From my experience, what we have now is not just a half-filled glass, I personally view it as probably at least 75% full (meaning, I think this is a big improvement over past efforts in past calamities). But please do not fault us for being a third-world country. Please do not explicitly or implicitly attribute everything to our incompetence, what might be due to other factors (such as those that result from limited resources or infrastructure, or those conditions that God or nature seems to have chosen for us). Our people are doing what they can, so let's give them a break. More so in these difficult times, when suffering is high, emotions are feverish, and tempers are frayed.It breaks my heart to see my countrymen suffering so much. I will do my share, whatever I can do to help. I will bear insults and harsh words, if this is the price for my people to receive the aid we need. I make no excuses for my country's shortcomings, but I just wish that some positive slant (the many small tales of heroism, the hard work of our soldiers, the volunteerism and compassion of the typical citizen, etc) would also be mentioned equally. I just needed to let you know how this particular Filipino reacts to your reporting, and I suspect there are many, many other folks who feel the same way that I do.For whatever the limitations, I still sincerely thank you for your coverage, and the benefits that it will bring my countrymen.Source:https://m.facebook.com/aireen.navarrokhauv/posts/10153544176195565",0

"Malacañang said President Rodrigo Duterte was pleased with the rehabilitation of Boracay, adding the bold move of shutting down the island for six months was “a lesson of political will.”“Boracay is a lesson of political will, as exhibited by PRRD (Duterte) and yet, it is also a lesson of neglect, misfeasance and malfeasance by responsible persons in office,” Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said in a statement on Saturday.“The cesspool that was Boracay would not have happened if political will was exhibited by those in authority and if only officials of the island paradise, as well as the stakeholders, operated following the law and the rules and regulations of pertinent government agencies,” he added.Panelo said the public should take these lessons to heart so Boracay can be recognized as a world-class beauty.“It has to take the strong and decisive leadership of the President to put things in order and we should all learn from these lessons so that Boracay will become an attraction not only in this country but in the world,” he said.“We commend the different departments for the evolution and development of Boracay, as well as the patience and cooperation of everyone,” he added.Boracay was closed in April this year after the President declared it a “cesspool.”It was reopened on October 26, although the government said the rehabilitation of the island would be completed by the end of 2019.",1
"Editor’s Note: Starting June 25, the Inquirer will run on its print, online, and social media platforms a series of stories, reports and commentaries on the socioeconomic impact – positive and negative – that President Duterte has made in his first year in office. The articles will focus on how the former Davao City mayor has coped with the challenges of the presidency in five major areas that Filipinos consider most important in their lives: peace and order, traffic, economy, governance and foreign policy. This evaluation of the administration’s achievements and shortcomings will take into account what Mr. Duterte had promised to do during last year’s presidential campaign, his June 30 inaugural speech and his July 25 State of the Nation Address.In trying to find peace for the country, President Rodrigo Duterte has likely discovered over the past 12 months that there is a world of difference between being head of state and being city mayor.Dennis Quilala, a University of the Philippines professor, said Mr. Duterte must have realized that dealing with communist rebels and Moro separatist groups was more complex on the national stage than at the local level.“I think the President has learned that the way he handled these groups in Davao City is quite different from handling them at the national level,” Quilala, who specializes in peace and conflict studies, told the Inquirer.Peace talks are where conflict is resolved",1
"Newly appointed National Food Authority Administrator Jason Aquino is facing serious disciplinary sanctions that could lead to his early exit from office over his repeated defiance of lawful orders of the NFA Council.Cabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco Jr., also the ex-officio chairman of the NFA Council, said willful disregard by Aquino of the council’s decision to extend rice importations under the Minimum Access Volume (MAV) scheme has put the country’s food security at risk.“The NFA administrator has actively refused to implement the lawful orders of [council] and directives of the [Cabinet Secretary] to publish and has even released a press statement countering the [council’s] decision that the MAV [scheme] has been extended to March 31,” Evasco said in a statement.“Instead, what were posted were extensions only for India and Pakistan, when the council explicitly granted extension to all sources of origin,” he added.Evasco reminded Aquino that it is not for him as NFA administrator to decide whether an extension of MAV is proper, let alone which sources should be granted the extension.“It is a decision, which the NFA Council has to make as a collegial body. We [council] have made a decision, and we made it very clear, it is extended up to March 31,” he said.The NFA is one of the 12 agencies that has been placed under the direct supervision of the Office of the Cabinet Secretary pursuant to Executive Order 1.The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said Aquino “is compromising the country’s food security, and showing his penchant for creating more debts at the expense of the NFA.”Aside from the Cabinet Secretary as chairman and the NFA administrator as vice chairman, the other members of the NFA Council are the governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the chairman of the Development Bank of the Philippines, the president of the Land Bank of the Philippines, the Finance secretary, the Trade secretary, the NEDA and a farmer sector representative.Of the 10 members of the council, nine were present during the February 27 meeting and voted for the extension of MAV importation scheme to March 31 from the original deadline of February 28.Aquino and the NFA management did not attend the meeting.“Aquino by using my name has cancelled the first two NFA Council meetings, thus the council was compelled to convene the third time meeting last February 27, during which he deliberately absented himself,” Evasco said.He noted that the council has thumbed down Aquino’s proposal to import buffer stock via government-to-government transaction in lieu of the purely private sector-led importation through the MAV scheme that is intended to boost industry stocks.“The difference between the two is, when you import via [government-to-government], the NFA would again incur debt, while MAV importation is paid for by the private sector. Besides, [according to] NEDA, in two months the country’s harvest season will begin,” Evasco said.Aquino, in a letter to Evasco, said extending the MAV importation by a month might open the floodgates to rice smuggling.Reacting to Aquino’s letter addressed to Evasco, Edwin Paraluman, farmer sector representative to the NFA Council said, “His fear of smuggling is extremely unfounded. A new law, Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act of 2016, is already in place and is harsh enough to emasculate illegitimate traders. And it is the Bureau of Customs’ job, not the NFA’s.”“It seems to us that he [Aquino] does not have even the slightest understanding of his office and is even undermining the [council’s] authority… causing serious prejudice to the country’s food security. We are afraid he is not fit for the job. He must be dealt with accordingly,” Evasco said.JAMES KONSTANTIN GALVEZ",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday defended his decision to put the Bureau of Customs (BOC) temporarily under military control, saying there was “no law and order” in the corruption-plagued agency.Speaking about illegal drugs and the national security situation in Malacañang, the President said he did not order the military to take over the functions of BOC employees and that he did not appoint soldiers to civilian posts, as this is prohibited by the 1987 Constitution.“When I called in the Army to help the BOC, there was no designation, there was no appointment and there was never instruction for them to take over the functions of the employees,” he said.‘Floating status’The PResident said the only ones he placed on “floating status” were the chiefs of offices and section chiefs.The employees in those offices and sections would continue working, he said.The President ordered a temporary military takeover of the BOC last month amid a scandal involving the smuggling into the country of “shabu” (crystal meth) worth P11 billion through Manila International Container Terminal (MICT).The President reassigned Customs Commissioner Isidro Lapeña to the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, a Cabinet post, and replaced him with Rey Leonardo Guerrero, a former chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.Lapeña was removed from the BOC after denying for weeks that shabu had been smuggled through MICT.But results of a reexamination by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) of four magnetic lifters believed to have been used to conceal the shabu proved undeniable, forcing Lapeña to acknowledge the possibility of the drug smuggling.Last year, shabu worth P6.4 billion also slipped past the BOC at the Port of Manila, setting off a congressional investigation that pressured Lapeña’s predecessor in the agency, former Marine Capt. Nicanor Faeldon, to resign.In his speech on Tuesday, the President said the smuggling of illegal drugs into the country had been raised to the level of national security threat.“Every administration, there’s always a shipment of drugs. But these ex-military men, because I trust them, the problem is the shipment slipped past them,” the President said, referring to Faeldon and Lapeña, a former police official.He said the uncontrolled smuggling of drugs through the ports was a law and order problem.“That is part of the law and order situation. It has nothing to do with designation or appointment of any person. I’m just trying to control crime,” the President said.",1
"As students threaten to stage more walk outs from their classes, the University of the Philippines in Diliman is preparing to implement a new policy that would penalize those who waste taxpayer money.Sources close to the Board of Regents say that a new memo is awaiting signature. It states that students who are caught walking out of their classes will be blacklisted and will be asked to refund the government-portion of their tuition and other fees.So, a student who is on full scholarship could be returning as much as P37,000 which represents tuition and other fees per semester.For those on partial scholarships or beneficiaries of socialized tuition, they will be asked for a reimbursement based on the percentage of taxpayer money spent on their education.Other U.P. campuses throughout the country are reportedly considering a similar move.",0

"THE Department of Education has yet to decide if it will allow the distribution of condoms in schools but if the plan of the Department of Health is implemented, only those in junior and senior high school will be getting the free rubber, Education Secretary Leonor Briones said.Briones has sought “top level” talks with the DOH to discuss the plan.“That is a very sensitive issue. Hindi sila tatayo diyan sa pinto at bawat pumasok ay bibigyan kagaya ng mga nagbibigay ng mga leaflets sa shopping center, hindi ganun. . . At hindi ka magdi-distribute kung walang counselling, kailangan may magpapaliwanag (You just don’t stand on school gates and hand out condoms to students who enter just like those who distribute leaflets in shopping centers. And you should not distribute without giving counselling first, there has to be an explanation). It’s not going to be a mass event,” Briones said.Should the DepEd give the green light to condom distribution, Briones said it will be done only in junior and senior high schools.She added that the distribution of condoms should not be an “instrument for the promotion of promiscuity and debasement of moral values.”Teachers will also have to be trained on how to properly explain to students why condoms are being distributed and “the many repercussions of pre-marital sex.”“What they really want is to increase awareness on AIDS, because the rate of teenage pregnancy and HIV/AIDS is high.

"THE Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) has vowed to shoulder the medical expenses of the child of the security guard who holed himself up in a room in a mall in Quezon City on Wednesday.Hermigildo Marsula Jr., of the Grandiose Security and Services Corp., was drunk when he caused panic at Eton Centris mall. Reports said he was driven to desperation because he had no money for his sick child who needs to undergo surgery.PCSO General Manager Alexander Balutan on Thursday said he directed his staff to coordinate with the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) to find out how the agency can help the child.“The PCSO is always ready to help Filipinos, whether they are rich or poor, we are always ready to help them,” Balutan said.Balutan said every Filipino in need should not hesitate to seek PCSO assistance to avoid what happened to Marsula.“The PCSO is one with the government in fulfilling the dream of President Rodrigo Duterte that no one will die due to sickness because they don’t have money to pay for hospitalization,” Balutan said.PCSO Chairman Jose Jorge Corpuz assured the family of Marsula that the agency will help pay the cost of the child’s operation.“That is our mandate, to assist in the medical and financial needs of Filipinos whether they are security guards or any Juan dela Cruz,” Corpuz said. “As I always say, the agency does not choose who to help, everyone is welcome here. That is the real mandate of the agency, to help those in need,” Balutan said.“We have 57 PCSO branches in different parts of the country, you can submit the required documents to the nearest branch for us to give you financial assistance,” he added.",1
" President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday said he was losing hope in the outcome of the peace process with Moro rebels because of infighting among them.Speaking before members of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao police force here, Mr. Duterte said he recognized that the Moro issue was “a legitimate grievance, which we are trying to resolve.”“I am talking to the (Moro Islamic Liberation Front) and also the MNLF (Moro National Liberation Front) but apparently they’re squabbling over (territories). So I’m at a loss. I was very optimistic before but I’m a bit pessimistic now,” he said.He said MNLF chair Nur Misuari was “keeping his silence but [talked] to me in private.”“But his misgivings about the other groups, it used to be MNLF then there was the sprouting up of MILF, BIFF (Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters), everything. It has (become) a convoluted thing,” Mr. Duterte said.The President said he was now worried that “nothing would come out of this (talks).”However, Mr. Duterte said he was still hoping for the success of the talks.He also urged policemen to do their duty even if “sometimes, it could end not only your career but your life.”He then reassured them of full government support for their families, in case they meet misfortune in the performance of their duties.“Our constant worry is what would happen to our children when we leave. Your children will be assured of education and your wives will be given employment. I wouldn’t leave you wanting,” he said.Mr. Duterte pledged that by the time he leaves the Presidency, “I would have invested [billions] for the trust fund of your children and family.”“I have nothing but the best for all of you,” he added.",1

He is not an MIA president. He does not hide behind the hydras who can't communicate. He is hands on. Too hands on.Check his house and ask: Have we had a president who stays in such a house? Have we had a president who relishes eating in turo turos? How I wished I was alive when President Ramon Magsaysay was our leader. Then we can point to a certain model. Then again was Magsaysay a free mandate?My generation came with Marcos in our formative years until college. Unlike my parents, they had several presidents. Mine were Aquino, Ramos, Estrada, Macapagal-Arroyo, Aquino III or a total of 30 years. Marcos was for 18 years. Tell me, should I support an unconstitutional removal of a sitting president? Why should I?Duterte thinks in Bisaya, translates it to English and Tagalog and so what do we get in terms of communications? Not presidential,And he tries so hard to explain to all of us.Listen to him.but he carries the same messages in every event live streamed. He tries to explain and educate us. Just this afternoon, he was in Cagayan, an LP territory with a very close barkada of BSA3 sitting as governor. Did Duterte asked him to go down the stage? He did not. In fact, Duterte conferred with him. Gov. Mamba was onstage. DSWD Sec. Judy Taguiwalo is there and she has been holding the fort as Lawin lashed.Give them space. Let them work.

"~HOURS before multi-media mogul Kris Aquino appeared before the Mandaluyong Prosecutor’s Office on Thursday afternoon to verify the 44 counts of qualified theft she filed against former business partner, Nicardo “Nicko” Falcis 2nd, his brother Jesus Nicardo Falcis 3rd finally issued the very first statement coming from the side of the accused.In a video posted by Entertainment portal Pep.ph’s Arniel Serato, the younger Falcis denied Aquino’s allegations and expressed that his brother has been forced to remain abroad for fear of his personal safety.“Yesterday, November 14, Kris Aquino already identified my brother explicitly and personally as the one who allegedly stole money from her.

But my brother, Nicko Falcis will not be here in the Philippines to celebrate with us,” Jesus began his five-minute video statement.“Contrary to the claims of Ms. Aquino and her lawyers, my brother’s staying abroad is not an indication of guilt. She took away my brother from our family and my brother is forced to stay abroad because of serious threats to his person and safety. I know for a fact and I heard it personally. Ms. Aquino threatened my brother. She said, “You f—–g a—–e Nicko, wag kang tatapak dito sa Pilipinas (don’t step in the Philippines). Dare to step in this country and you will be dead.”According to Jesus, Aquino claimed she has in possession a list of Nicko’s flight records, which to the Falcis’ family comes across as a threat that she can monitor Nicko’s whereabouts and ultimately that she has powerful friends.“Grave threats coming from the daughter and sister of former presidents, we do not take lightly. I have nightmares about it; I can hear it now vividly as I recount it. The reality is, I would never imagine I would hear someone I just used to watch on television and the daughter of Ninoy (the late senator Benigno Aquino Jr.) and Cory (the late president Corazon) Aquino to say those things,” Jesus said.“That is the reason why my brother is not here–will not be here– during the preliminary investigation later, and will not be here on my dad’s birthday on Sunday. A complete family is important but my brother’s life and safety is more important.”Ridiculous chargesGoing into specifics, Jesus said, “Ms. Aquino has also defamed my brother’s reputation over the past few months on social media and the mainstream media. She would say tens of millions of pesos were stolen from her. And suddenly all she ever filed were cases of qualified theft for the total amount of P1.2 million? The charges are bases and totally ridiculous!“The truth will eventually come out. If any of the media will go to the prosecutor’s [office] and get a copy of her complaint, then they will see that these are all ridiculous.“Credit card charges [as] qualified theft? For a lawyer like me, kailangan may physical taking para masabing nakaw. How can you steal a credit card charge? And all of the credit card charges were all authorized. They have an agreement as to this,” he continued.Jesus guaranteed the public through his video message that further questions about regarding Aquino’s claims can best answered by his brother once the family can be sure to protect his safety and he can come home.At the moment, Jesus said there was still no need for his brother to present himself to the prosecutor as they still have to confirm the cases filed.Nicko turns down KrisUnable to control his emotions, Jesus went on to reveal that the conflict between his brother and Aquino began when he refused to continue working full time for her.“Nicko has many other commitments that Ms. Aquino was aware of—well aware of—and had agreed [for him] to [accept] before. This [reaction to his refusal], my brother did not foresee; that it would be a reason for such a tumultuous falling out with a former close friend, but who obviously abhors rejection and absolute worship,” he related.“We have been silent for the past few months and have been negotiating with Ms. Aquino in good faith sincerely for settlement because she has always reached out [to us] personally. It’s not true that my family have not been serious or sincere. It was Ms. Aquino who filed the cases while the negotiations were ongoing. And she was saying no cases will be filed.“To reiterate my brother, Nicardo Falcis 2nd did not commit 44 counts of Qualified Theft under Article 310 in relation to Articles 308 and 309 of the Revised Penal Code, whether for P1.2 million or any amount. All of the details of these cases will be itemized in our legal answers when we file our counter affidavit soon enough, which the media can obtain from the prosecutor’s after we file.“My brother is innocent. We may not come from a political family or [have] powerful friends at our behest but we have the truth on our side.”Aquino’s son, Bimby, with ex-husband and cager James Yap accompanied her to the Mandaluyong Prosecutor’s Office where the erstwhile “Queen of All Media” verified the same complaints she also filed against Falcis in San Juan, Taguig, Pasig, Makati, Manila and Quezon City in October.According to the actress’ criminal complaint, Falcis “exploited his position of trust and confidence” when he allegedly used a credit card she issued for the operations of her company Kristina C. Aquino Productions (KCAP) for his personal expenses.Identifying Falcis as her project manager since 2016, Aquino said stated in her complaints, “In all, respondent had charged P1,270,980.31 to the KCAP Card for personal expenses without my consent. Prior to my discovery of these expenses and demand for their payment, respondent neither informed me about them nor undertook or made arrangements to settle them.”Aquino explained that the credit card had a ₱2-million limit, which she set aside for advertisements of brand partners. However, she discovered such purchases like 95 cups of coffee and cosmetic products from Mac worth ₱99,200 when the bills were delivered to her house.According to her sworn statement, she discovered that Falcis “misappropriated KCAP funds in July 2018.”Word war beginsIn a statement, Aquino’s lawyer Sigfrid Fortun, claimed that Falcis fled the country because of the case and that his lawyers are seeking the inhibition of the “entire San Juan Prosecutor’s office from hearing and resolving her complaint.”Fortun said Falcis argued the actress was “charming her way to get the prosecutor to rule in [her] favor and secure an indictment.”Meanwhile, when asked to react on the statement of Falcis’ brother, Aquino told members of the press, “I never met you. I also checked kasi baka may mga sabihin tungkol sa kapatid ko. He has never met my brother [former president Noynoy Aquino]. Even Nicko has never met my brother. Hindi ito away pamilya. This is something that is unfortunate but I will repeat this: Kasi ang last statement is that we were open to an amicable settlement. We tried six times. What changed?”“Let me just say this. Nicko, I owe you and I have loved you. Sana nga tama ang sinasabi niyo na gusto niyong makipag-ayos,” Aquino ended.Earlier reports said the actress-host engaged the services of Falcis as managing director of her digital media company, KCAP, and was responsible for landing her the “Crazy Rich Asians” cameo in Hollywood.ABS-CBN’s digital entertainment arm Push.com quoted sources as far back as December 31, 2017 that Falcis was in fact the reason why Aquino left the management team of her good friend and network host Boy Abunda.The same article further reported, “Nicko Falcis is Kris’ new manager. He was responsible for making her earnings from digital media nearly exceed those from traditional TV by February 2018.” WITH A REPORT FROM ED VELASCO",1
"A WASTE and pollution watch group has urged those who are filing their Certificates of Candidacy and aspiring to become barangay (village) and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK or Youth Council) leaders to take up the cudgels to care for the environment.Daniel Alejandre, Zero Waste Campaigner of EcoWaste Coalition, over the weekend said the country needs grassroots leaders who will inspire and guide communities to the cause of environmental conservation and protection and make sure that villages are cared for.“Barangay and SK leaders are front liners of public service and have a huge responsibility in making our neighborhoods clean, healthy and safe for everyone, especially for children who are most vulnerable to harm and illness,” Alejandre added.He said the villages need public servants who will help in enforcement by local government units (LGUs) of environmental laws and regulations that seek to protect air, water, soil and the people against damaging and polluting activities.He cited Republic Act (RA) 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (ESWMA), which calls for waste prevention, volume reduction, segregation at source, recycling and composting.“This [implementation of RA 9003] can be done through the adoption of best environmental practices in ecological solid waste management, excluding incineration,” Alejandre said.Also citing the 2017-2022 Philippine Development Plan (PDP), he noted that the LGUs’ compliance with the ESWMA has been low and majority of local areas are still unserved by solid waste management (SWM) facilities or materials recovery facilities (MRFs).Based on the PDP, Alejandre said, only 31.28 percent of villages are covered by SWM facilities and 30.92 percent by MRFs, which are below the 2016 targets of 67.39 percent and 77.10 percent, respectively.He added that RA 9003 requires the establishment of MRFs or ecology centers in every barangay or cluster of villages “to receive, sort, process and store compostable and recyclable materials efficiently and in an environmentally sound manner.”“These MRFs have the potential to boost community-driven ecological waste management that will reduce hauling costs, conserve resources, prevent spillage of plastics to water bodies and foster environmental values among the people,” Alejandre said.“We hope that those running for the barangay and SK polls come May 14 do recognize the importance of enforcing RA 9003 in their localities and their role to get the law implemented,” he added.The EcoWaste Coalition expressed hope that contenders will address garbage and other pressing environmental concerns in their electoral platforms, and that voters will support pro-Mother Earth candidates on Election Day.On Friday, it launched its campaign for waste-free barangay and SK elections outside the Commission on Elections headquarters and in the presence of Commissioner Luie Tito Guia.“We are urging candidates to campaign in a manner that will not misuse resources, dirty the surroundings and cause damage to community health and the environment,” the group said.",1
"Only judicial courts may order the arrest of a civilian like Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay said on Wednesday, maintaining that the 1987 Constitution does not authorize President Rodrigo Duterte to detain any citizen arbitrarily.Hilbay, a professor of constitutional law at the University of the Philippines, also said the government was barred from reviving the criminal cases against Trillanes, as these had been dismissed by the courts after the former military officer was granted amnesty.“Trillanes is already a civilian when he became senator. You cannot be both a civilian and a military person at the same time. That means the military has no authority to arrest him,” he added.Hilbay said the President could not undo the amnesty granted by former President Benigno Aquino III to Trillanes and other rebel soldiers belonging to the Magdalo group.“Once it is granted, it cannot be revoked. That’s the point of amnesty. After one has been forgiven, it’s time for us to move on to avoid troubles,” Hilbay said.“The President has no constitutional authority to revoke an amnesty,” he said.Vice President Leni Robredo on Wednesday condemned President’s order voiding Trillanes’ amnesty, saying it was clearly an attempt by the chief executive to silence his critics.Speaking at a news conference in Zamboanga City, Robredo said the opposition would fight all attempts of the administration to persecute its critics and silence voices critical of the government.“An opposing voice is important in a democracy, especially when something is going on that we think is not right,” she said.‘Missing’ applicationIn a statement issued on Wednesday, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said the sudden disappearance of Trillanes’ 2011 application for amnesty was not a sufficient reason for President Duterte to invalidate the pardon given to the former military officer.“The mere report that ‘there is no available copy of his application for amnesty in the records’ does not show that he did not apply because if he did not apply, he should not have been granted amnesty,” Lagman said.“The ‘missing’ application could have been maliciously concealed or deliberately destroyed,” Lagman said. “There is a presumption of regularity and compliance with prerequisites and conditions in the grant of amnesty to Trillanes.”News reports and videos of Trillanes’ application are publicly available and should be enough to debunk Malacañang’s claims, Lagman pointed out.“The revocation of Trillanes’ amnesty … is unwarranted because an amnesty is final, absolute and irrevocable,” he added.Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate said the political persecution of Trillanes and other critics of the President would spark a bigger opposition to the Duterte administration.Zarate said the Department of Justice’s application for a warrant of arrest for Trillanes was an admission that Mr. Duterte’s Proclamation No. 572 was not the same as an arrest order.“We’re not under martial law. The President may have forgotten that he’s not yet a full-blown dictator,” Zarate said.",1
"US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday he would not rule out “anything” after a suspected chemical attack in Syria triggered speculation about a US military response, and he piled blame on Russia for falling short on its obligations to ensure that Syria abandoned its chemical weapons capabilities.US President Donald Trump warned on Sunday there would be a “big price to pay” after aid groups said dozens of people were killed by poison gas in a besieged rebel-held town in Syria, an attack the opposition blamed on Syrian government forces.“The first thing we have to look at is why are chemical weapons still being used at all when Russia was the framework guarantor of removing all the chemical weapons. And so, working with our allies and our partners from NATO to Qatar and elsewhere, we are going to address this issue,” Mattis said before the start of a meeting with Qatar’s Emir.Mattis had been asked if the U.S. was capable of striking President Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons facilities.When asked if he could rule out taking actions, like launching airstrikes against Assad, Mattis said: “I don’t rule out anything right now.”The Syrian government denied its forces had launched any chemical assault, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said such allegations were false and a provocation.U.S. government sources said Washington’s assessment was that chemical weapons were used in a besieged rebel-held town in Syria, but they are still evaluating details.Assad is believed to have secretly kept part of Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile despite a U.S.-Russian deal under which Damascus was supposed to have handed over all such weapons for destruction in 2014, officials have said in recent monthsA deadly sarin attack on a rebel-held area prompted Trump to order a missile strike last year on the Shayrat air base.",1
"Starting on Monday, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Tesda) would provide livelihood training programs to Mayon evacuees to help them earn a living away from their homes.According to Tesda Director General Guiling Mamondiong, at least five training programs would be held at San Francisco Elementary School and Malilipot Elementary School, which had been turned into evacuation centers next week.Mamondiong said one of the programs would teach 25 evacuees how to make face masks, which would be distributed to fellow evacuees, policemen and soldiers deployed to the area.3,000 evacueesThere are currently 3,000 evacuees at the two schools, mostly from the villages of Calbayog, San Roque and Tugawe.Other training programs would be on manicure, pedicure, massage and bread-making which Tesda said could keep evacuees busy and earn their keep even if they were holed up in evacuation centers.The initial damage wrought by Mayon volcano on the Bicol region’s agricultural sector has now reached P1.56 million, according to a report by the Department of Agriculture (DA).Vegetable farms suffered the heaviest damage with estimates reaching P1 million. More damage reports were expected from areas hit by ashfall.Initial damage reportThe DA report said at least 42 metric tons of crops were destroyed and 112 hectares of farms were hit. At least 141 farmers were now facing income losses.Among the vegetables that were destroyed were bitter gourd, beans, eggplants, okra, string beans, sayote, chilies, tomato and “upo” (bottle gourd).The region’s abaca industry also suffered a hit with losses estimated to be worth P478,000.DA officials continued to evacuate livestock animals within the 7-8 kilometer permanent danger zone around Mayon. A total of 167 animals had been removed from harm’s way.During natural calamities, the DA said it was prepared to give out loans to farmers and fishermen.Under the survival and recovery loan program, they can avail of grants worth P5,000 for immediate aid and at least P20,000 which they could use as starting capital.",1
"‘Police investigators here are now closely pursuing a lead on a “person-of-interest” in relation to the murder of a radio anchorman recently.Supt. Jonathan Pineda, the police chief of Dumaguete City, confirmed that they have summoned Lourdes, the wife of the late Edmund Sestoso, and some witnesses Friday afternoon to help investigators in the identification of the “person-of-interest” who may be responsible for the broadcaster’s death.“Actually, meron na tayong person-of-interest pero di pa maano (disclose) ni PD kasi nag transition pa sya (The Provincial Director cannot yet disclose it because he is still in a transition phase),” Pineda pointed out.He was referring to Sr. Supt. Raul Tacaca, who assumed office on Friday in lieu of former provincial police director Sr. Supt. Edwin Portento.According to Pineda, the provincial police director is appointed head of the multi-agency task force created to investigate Sestoso’s death.Tacaca still has to review the case folder on the death of Sestoso, Pineda said.But he said that by Tuesday next week, the police would be able to make an announcement on developments related to the killing of Sestoso.Sestoso, 50 years old, married and a resident of Dumaguete City, was shot in broad daylight on April 30 just as he was returning to his boarding house from his regular morning program, Tug-anan sa Power 91, at DYGB-FM.He succumbed the following day to multiple organ failure secondary to multiple gunshot wounds.The Presidential Task Force on Media Security, headed by Undersecretary Joel Egco, and other Palace Officials including Special Assistant to the President Christopher Lawrence Go and Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Martin Andanar visited Sestoso’s wake last week upon orders of President Rodrigo Duterte.The President had directed a full investigation into the death of the Dumaguete-based journalist, the first ever to happen in the “City of Gentle People”.Pineda clarified that no suspect has been arrested yet but he disclosed that the police could be filing a case next week after they have gathered all the necessary evidence.",1
"Recently, Martial Law became the topic because of my alma mater, Ateneo, coming out with a statement claiming that vice-presidentiable Bongbong Marcos is revising history. My question is, what historical revisionism is being done? All Marcos said in effect is, let people decide for themselves what they want to believe. There’s no revisionism in that. There’s also the assumption that the younger Marcos is part of the group that deserves to be punished for torturing and killing Filipinos back then. But he was also a kid that time and would have no knowledge of how to make Martial Law work for him. His father and the government officials at the time, including Juan Ponce Enrile and Fidel Ramos, were calling the shots.They’re probably thinking of the alleged connection between Imee Marcos and the murder of Archimedes Trajano. I have been shown an article from 1992 where a U.S. court found the Marcos father and Imee liable for this, but was also told a Philippine court voided the case. There is also the picture where it is alleged that Bongbong Marcos was in fatigues because he wanted to bomb and kill ordinary people. I would say that’s someone’s opinion. It was more likely that he was preparing to defend his family because of the coup d’etat that Enrile and Ramos mounted at the time, the event that was the actual start of Edsa 1 (I wonder if people even remember that there was a coup d’etat at the time, and that there was a firefight at the channel 9 tower where a soldier was killed; “bloodless revolution” my foot).I can guess what they’re actually thinking. They believe is that letting Marcos go free supports impunity. This is thought of as absolving the perpetrators of their crimes and letting justice stay unserved. So Bongbong Marcos running around free angers them.Let me just repeat one thing that fellow blogger Ilda said before: the Marcoses are back because the Aquinos welcomed them with open arms. Also, as our esteemed webmasterBenign0 wrote, serious allegations have to be run through a court of law. Otherwise they are just hearsay, the legal term for tsismis, something which still has the capacity to damage people.If they claim that jailing Marcos is symbolic, it would be a false symbol. It is like how I explained the case of former president Gloria Arroyo; people want a symbolic scapegoat to be punished, but will let all the others doing the actual corruption run free. It is not a victory, it is defeat.Let’s say they indeed convict Marcos and get him jailed: what will it effect? Will it solve our economic woes? Will it make people’s lives better and easier? Perhaps it will make people feel better. But people feeling better does not solve problems, it only masks them. And once the effects set in, people will stop feeling better. As the saying goes: you can jail the killer, but it won’t bring the murdered loved one back.There is also a clear double standard. Why don’t the Ateneo people make a statement condemning the two Aquino regimes, as they have atrocities committed in their name too, such as the Mendiola Massacre in 1987 (which before I mistakenly believed was Marcos era) and the recent SAF 44 murder by insurgents? Thus, many other accusations fly that the faculty were bought, if not deceived.As my title says, all this distracts us from the real issues affecting us. Among those issues are the problems brought up by our new blogger Cynicmandirigma, who highlighted the absurd difficulties in handling the paperwork for his business. There were so many anomalies in his experience that he advised people to flee the country instead of doing business here (I even surmised that the government people want more Filipinos to become OFWs, which will mean more money to pillage as “tribute”). That in addition to a crazy problem some months back with receipts when many business people have had new receipts printed, only to learn that the BIR still considered them invalid. Then this case of car plates from the LTO. I remember seeing a post that claimed the monumentally delayed car plates from the Land Transportation Office were now being made outside the country (maybe China), the claim being made by the former contractor (GJB). Presidential mouthpiece Edwin Lacierda denied it (see picture below). But now, why are the car plates in Customs if they’re made locally? And more. This bureaucracy isn’t the result of Martial Law, but a continuous buildup of corrupt practices in government that started in the Cory era.If people are afraid that Bongbong Marcos will impose Martial Law once again, I say that’s silly. Martial Law implementation is a group effort, Bongbong can’t do it alone. Back then, it required the help of Enrile, Ramos and other people to implement it. Don’t forget even business and civil society leaders back then supported Martial Law. Today, no one would support that, because they know how dangerous it was. But anyway, business and civil society leaders will support whoever is in power, and the corrupt politicians will jump to whoever’s the ruling party, so they can continue their shenanigans.If ever martial law is feared, there’s even more reason to fear Rodrigo Duterte doing it (despite his flipflopping on the issue). And some people who want martial law imposed again have this as reasons: asshole drivers on the road; the rocks being thrown by kids at cars on C-5; rise of crime in the cities and the brazen nature of it; and more. The loss of patience leads to people having greater acceptance for more drastic measures.That helps lead to the point raised about why Marcos is getting popular; it’s because the Aquino regime today is a failure. It’s corrupt, too. So the people who realize the failure, if they have a black-and-white view of things, will switch to the perceived diametric opposite. And about the 2016 elections: does anyone even wonder why the choices are so none-of-the-above (NOTA – I remember that TV ad back then)?I’d say people are really wasting their time calling for Marcos to be held liable if they are not calling for the current Malacanang seatwarmer to be liable as well. There are other things to talk about, such as the problem with the business process that cynicmandirigma wrote about, and other things. And, seriously, no one with the power or influence is even talking about the Chinese incursion in the Spratly Islands and other islands in the West Philippine Sea. They’re just leaving the soldiers in the BRP Sierra Madre to rot.Let me just say the painful but obvious truth about the real issues: Filipino culture itself is corrupt. We complain about politicians getting in unqualified family members and friends into posts, but we do that in ordinary life. We complain about politicians stealing from public funds and resources, but don’t ordinary people do that to companies, schools, organizations and other funds as well? And having people killed through assassins or killing someone you hate, don’t ordinary people do it too (just look at the news these days)? Truly, as was asked before, aren’t our leaders a reflection of ourselves as a people?The country’s greatest enemy is its own people. Unless we, the people, fix our habits and behavior, we end up the ones dragging our country down.",0

"A coconut farmer group calls Poe and Escudero beyond “naïve” and “misinformed”, their statements on Danding Cojuangco and Coco Levy Fund Scam ""a great big lie.""“A Great Big Lie”“The time for pretension is over. Senators Poe and Escudero had obviously drawn the line on the decades-old coconut levy scam,” said Joey Faustino, Executive Director of the Coconut Industry Reform Movement (COIR) Inc.Faustino said, “Recent comments made by the two in a campaign sortie in Quezon Province yesterday clearly project the position of Danding Cojuangco and his Nationalist Peoples Coalition on the coco levy. So to claim that they are one with the coconut farmers in resolving this issue is a great big lie.”Did you know that the 70s Coco Levy Fund Scam is still unresolved up to this day? Did you also know that it's 10-15...Posted by The Thinking Pinoy on Thursday, March 10, 2016Presidential candidate and Senator Grace Poe drew flak from the public for her recent statements about Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco , one of her biggest campaign donors and also one of the main actors in the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) Scam, more commonly known as the Coco Levy Fund Scam.In a press conference in Candelaria, Quezon Poe was asked about her opinion about Cojuangco’s involvement in the said scam.Poe said, “But the problem is that Danding Cojuangco doesn’t control it anymore because all the shares (bought with the coco levy funds) are now with the government.”Cojuangco, uncle of President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III, heads the Nationalist People’s Coalition, the second-largest political party in the Philippines. The NPC recently pledged its support for Poe’s candidacy.Presidential Candidate Grace PoeDanding still meddlesFaustino explained that San Miguel Corporation (SMC) shares that Poe was referring to are just a portion of Cojuangco’s coco levy-funded investments.“Some 4% of these CIIF-SMC shares, worth more than P17B, still remain in the possession of San Miguel Corporation which Cojuangco had refused to turn over to government,” Faustino said.Faustino said Cojuangco actively blocked Pres. Aquino’s attempt at utilizing sequestered CIIF-SMC shares.“[Aquino’s Executive Order No. 180]… was challenged in Court by the camp of the Philippine Coconut Producers Federation Inc. (COCOFED), a Danding Cojuangco-related group of big business and land-owners who lorded over the coco levy funds under the dictatorship,” Faustino said.In June 2015, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order on EO 180 , the Aquino administration’s attempt to utilize a portion of the recovered coco levies for direct benefits of the coconut farmers.Danding Cojuangco (L) and his nephew, Pres. Aquino (R)Coco Levy FundThe Coco Levy Fund Scam was a controversy in the 1970s and 80's in the Philippines involving the former President Ferdinand Marcos and his cronies.It is alleged that Marcos, Danding Cojuangco, Juan Ponce Enrile, and others conspired to tax coconut farmers, promising them the development of the coconut industry and a share of the investments, but on the contrary were used for personal profit particularly in the purchase of United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) and majority stake in San Miguel Corporation (SMC), to name a few.The issue has not died today, with coconut farmers fighting for justice against the forced taxation, and a share of the Coco Levy Funds' investments. The Coco Levy Fund is estimated to have ballooned anywhere in the range of P100-150 billion in assets.This is about 10 to 15 times bigger than Pork Barrel (PDAF) scam, allegedly masterminded byJanet Lim-Napoles.The Coco Levy tax was supposed to help poor coconut farmers.Poe, Escudero insincereFaustino slammed the two senators’ alleged insincerity about the plight of coco farmers.“Finally, if there was even a tinge of truth to what these two Senators say on the coconut levy issue, they had so willfully missed to affix their signatures to the Coconut Farmers and Industry Trust Fund Bill,” Faustino said.Initiated by the KILUS Magniniyog, the bill aimed to protect the recovered coconut levies and establish a trust fund that would directly benefit the coconut farmers.Certified as urgent by the Aquino Administration, the bill was passed by the House of Representatives.The bill, however, did not reach Plenary in the Senate.“…Yet not an effort was made by Poe or Escudero in the whole process,” Faustino said.“The public should know so as not to be deceived,” Faustino said.Did you like this post?

"Eight suspected members of a syndicate are now jailed on charges of alleged estafa for using the records of a retired police official to fraudulently apply for a P2-million loan from the Armed Forces of the Philippines Savings and Loans Inc. (AFPSLAI) local office, here.Superintendent Jonathan P. Paguio, city chief of police, identified the suspects as Seferino V. Rodolfo, 62, single, a resident of Barangay Aguado, Trece Martirez City, Cavite; Meriam D. Ungos, 49, widow, of Barangay San Nicolas, Pangasinan; Maribel M. Sionilo, 49, married, of Barangay Comembo, Makati; andJonathan P. Panceras, 41, single, also of Comembo, Makati; Alvin Abdul Kalam Mahamud, 43, of Upper Bernardo, Quezon City; Jesus C. Canero, 37, of Sta. Monica Village, San Fernando City; TSgt. Edwin P. Madrigal (retired), 49, of Barangay Lourdes, Tarlac City and Marivic E. Jose, 35, of Barangay Cogeo, Antipolo City.Investigation disclosed that suspect Rodolfo applied for a loan at AFPSLAI Office in Calapan City amounting to P2 million under the name of a certain retired police Superintendent Yolando O. Conaco, of Balua, Cagayan de Oro City.But upon verification at the Philippine National Police (PNP) Headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City by AFPSLAI-Lucena Branch Manager Carolyn P. de Villa, whose office processed the loan, it was found out that the real Supt.

"‘Thousands of spectators and merrymakers from here and out of town joined yesterday’s celebration of the “Libad Festival,” honoring St. John the Baptist and highlighted by the traditional “pagoda” fluvial procession along the river.Every village of the town participated in the lively singing, dancing and dousing of water on passersby to commemorate Saint John’s mission to “baptize” the earliest Christians.As expected, through the request of Governor Wilhelmino M. Sy-Alvarado, Supt. Santos Dugayo Mera Jr., acting chief of police in this town deployed hundred policemen in the areas and at the same time assigned a policeman on every boat that participated in the fluvial parade.Alvarado said he was happy that the Libad Festival remains among the popular tourist attractions and oldest religious celebrations in Bulacan.Citing the history of the traditional festivity, he said the San Juan Bautista Church in the town was initially made of Nipa and Bamboo constructed under Augustinian friars Martín de Rada and Diego Vivar until it was built in stone in 1700.The church has withstood not just time, but the Filipinos’ struggle to keep the Church through wars with the Spaniards, the American, and Japanese and even pirate attacks from the Moros and the Chinese.",1
"AtienzaA House leader has sought the collection of a P3,000 casino entrance charge from any and all persons entering any casino and similar gaming establishments.Isabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano III, who is part of the House contingent to the influential Commission on Appointments, said there is a need to strengthen regulations on the participation or engagement of individuals in casino gambling.“A casino entrance charge, collected from any person who is not an official or employee of any casino every time he or she enters a casino and similar gaming establishments, will serve as a deterrent to those who lack the resources or can ill afford to engage in casino gambling from entering any casino, “ he said.Albano filed House Bill 5871 to ensure that persons entering any and all casinos have the financial resources to engage in any form of gambling and related activities and to strengthen the regulation of gambling activities in the country.“The charges collected shall constitute a special fund which shall be utilized for the establishment and maintenance of children and youth welfare centers to be established nationwide under the supervision of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD),” the House leader said.He said 50 percent of the amount collected in the casino shall be used for children and youth welfare programs in the city or municipality where the casino is located.House Bill 5871 mandates the Department of Budget and Management, Department of Finance, Department of the Interior and Local Government and the DSWD to formulate and promulgate the implementing rules and regulations of the proposed Act.",1
"IT’S OK to have fun, but keep it solemn and orderly please.The Commission on Elections (Comelec) gave this reminder to people who will be trooping to its offices in Metro Manila and in the provinces starting today to file their certificates of candidacy (COCs) for the national balloting on May 9 next year.Comelec Chair Andres Bautista said candidates could have fun but they should ensure that all the documents they would submit had been filled out and notarized to avoid delays and trouble during the process.“We want it orderly and solemn but at the same time also fun. To me, you know, it’s a happy occasion [because] it celebrates our democracy,” Bautista told reporters in an interview on Saturday.Political season startsCandidates have until Oct. 16 to register as candidates in the 2016 elections. While the campaign does not officially start until February—90 days before Election Day—today marks the official start of the political season.Aside from the presidency and vice presidency, at stake in the elections are 12 seats in the Senate, 293 seats in the House of Representatives, 81 gubernatorial and 81 vice gubernatorial posts; 772 provincial board seats; 144 city mayoral and 144 city vice mayoral posts; 1,490 municipal mayoral and 1,490 vice mayoral posts, and 11,924 town council seats; one gubernatorial and one vice gubernatorial posts, and 24 seats in the regional assembly of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.Giving his last-minute reminders to the candidates, Bautista said candidates should make sure that all necessary attachments had been affixed to the main documents, including photos and certificates of nomination and acceptance if chosen by a political party.“The forms can be downloaded from the Comelec website. So, fill them out already before coming to the Comelec,” he said.Up to 3 companionsFor the first time, the election body will be limiting to three the number of persons accompanying candidates when they go to the Comelec’s main office in Intramuros, Manila, to file their COCs.Two video monitors will be set up outside the building for those who cannot be accommodated inside the office.Candidates will be asked to sign an “integrity pledge” on a Freedom Wall for a peaceful, honest and credible elections.Election Commissioner Luie Guia appealed to candidates to dispense with the fiesta atmosphere and put more solemnity to the entire process.“Consider the filing of COCs a sacred process in a sense that you are putting yourselves before the people and presenting yourselves as someone capable of leading the country,” Guia told reporters in a separate interview.“Rather than making it like a fiesta, it will be good if the process of the filing of your COC will be solemn, sacred and dignified,” he added.Poor’s hopesThe Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines’ Episcopal Commission on Public Affairs (CBCP-Ecpa) urged candidates to be reminded not of the “perks and grandeur” they could acquire should they win, but of the poor pinning their hopes on them.“The candidates must be willing to sacrifice their personal interests for the sake of those who have nothing in life,” said Fr. Jerome Secillano, executive secretary of the CBCP-Ecpa.“I pray that they may be guided in their pursuit of the common good as they shun the temptation to merely work for their personal good,” he added.As the filing of COCs begins, the Philippine National Police will provide security at Comelec offices.“There will be policemen providing security and order in the venues where the filing [of COCs] will be held, in addition to our regular law enforcement functions,” PNP spokesperson Chief Supt. Wilben Mayor said on Sunday.The command will also pull out officers assigned as security detail to candidates.Mayor said the Comelec would issue a resolution on the withdrawal of security detail. The PNP is under Comelec’s operational control during the election season.“There is a period during which candidates cannot have policemen assigned to them. They can apply for exemption with the Comelec depending on the threat assessment,” Mayor said.He added that the 160,000-strong PNP was constantly reminded of its duty to serve and to protect, and to remain nonpartisan in the upcoming elections.

"The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) has started its own due diligence and vetting of three Chinese contractors submitted by China to the Department of Finance for the P18.75-billion Kaliwa dam project, one of President Duterte’s flagship water security projects.MWSS Administrator Reynaldo Velasco said this was in compliance with the directive of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III for “MWSS to conduct its own due diligence in vetting the said Chinese companies/contractors subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations.”In a letter to Dominguez last September, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua submitted the three shortlisted Chinese contractors and companies namely, China Engineering Co. Ltd., Power China Ltd, and the Consortium of Guandung Foreign Construction Co. Ltd., and Guandong Yuantian Engineering Co. Ltd.Velasco met earlier with Chinese Commercial Counselor Jin Yuan who accompanied representatives of the three Chinese companies to present their credentials to the MWSS Technical Working Group.In a letter to the MWSS chief, Dominguez underscored the need to immediately start the procurement process and undertake limited competitive bidding among the said Chinese companies and contractors [following applicable procedures and documents under Republic Act. No. 9184, or Government Procurement Reform Act.”The Kaliwa dam project, which has a total cost of P18.75 billion, is situated in towns of General Nakar and Infanta in Quezon province. The project involves the construction of a dam with a discharge capacity of 600 million liters per day and a 27.7-kilometer raw water conveyance tunnel with a design capacity of 2.4 million liters per day.According to Velasco, the Chinese government has committed P10.2 billion in official development assistance (ODA) to fund the Kaliwa dam project.Velasco said the financing for the project would now be in the form of ODA loan, instead of a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme.The MWSS is also vigorously pursuing the Laiban dam project, which is three times bigger than the Kaliwa dam, for the overall water security of Metro Manila which sources 95.6 percent of potable water requirements from Angat and Ipo dams.",1
"The body of a boy fished out of a creek in Nueva Ecija province last week was buried on Wednesday amid doubts that he was Reynaldo “Kulot” de Guzman, who may have witnessed the killing of an alleged robber by police in Caloocan City last month.“He is really our son. He looks like his father,” said Lina de Guzman, wife of Eduardo Gabriel, who identified the body in a funeral parlor in Gapan City on Sept. 5 as that of his 14-year-old son, Reynaldo.Gabriel vowed that nobody could get the boy’s body without the family’s permission.“We will fight for it,” he said.For identificationA report spread on Tuesday that officers from the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) went to the wake for the boy in Cainta, Rizal province, to get the body.But Chief Supt. Dionardo Carlos explained on Wednesday that the CIDG team went to the wake only to examine the body for identification, not to get it.When the parents refused, the team withdrew, Carlos said.He said the PNP respected the family’s decision to bury the body, but added: “At the end of the day, we have the mandate to investigate the case, particularly who he is. He also has a family.”Carlos said the PNP would look at the place where the body was buried and make sure it was really there—in case it would be “needed in the ongoing investigation.”‘Missing person’On the request of Gapan police, the PNP Crime Laboratory conducted a DNA test on the boy’s body and returned a report on Monday that the body was not that of the Gabriel couple’s son Reynaldo.The PNP then declared Reynaldo de Guzman a “missing person.”The parents rejected the PNP finding and refused a second test.Persida Rueda-Acosta, chief of the Public Attorney’s Office, said the National Bureau of Investigation had done a DNA test on the body and found that it was the couple’s son.The boy was the last known companion of 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz, whom police said they killed in an exchange of gunfire after the former University of the Philippines student robbed a taxi driver in Caloocan on Aug. 18.But the taxi driver, Tomas Bagcal, told a news conference on Sunday that he caught Arnaiz with the help of bystanders and took him to the police station on 9th Avenue alive.Justice for victimsBagcal did not mention De Guzman.The body found in the Kinamatayang Kabayo creek in Gapan bore 26 stab wounds, and Gabriel said he recognized it as his son’s because of familiar marks.De Guzman, Arnaiz and 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos, whom Caloocan police shot dead in a drug raid on Aug. 16, were the latest victims in President Duterte’s fierce campaign again drugs and crime.During the Mass held at San Antonio Abad Parish Church before De Guzman’s burial in Pasig Public Cemetery on Wednesday morning, Fr. Loreto Sanchez Jr. demanded justice for the boy and other victims of the crackdown.Sanchez also excoriated the country’s leaders for playing politics for personal gain.“To our leaders, I hope you avoid politicking. The campaign and the elections are over. There are now many issues we need to face,” Sanchez said in his homily.He also urged those present to pray for innocent victims of Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, saying one death in a family is a loss for all families.“The Church will continue to advocate for the value of each life,” Sanchez said, adding that keeping quiet is cowardice.He said he hoped the killers of De Guzman would feel remorse and turn themselves in for a “chance to renew themselves.”",1
"New Commissioner Sheriff Abbas is a seasoned civil servant qualified to sit in the Commission on Elections, Malacañang said on Saturday in defending the appointment made by President Benigno Aquino III amid insinuations it was influenced by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).Abbas is said to be a nephew of MILF chief peace negotiator Mohagher Iqbal.Deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said “it was made known” to the Palace that Iqbal and Abbas were relatives in the course of the vetting conducted by the Malacañang search committee.“But, obviously, what some people are trying to imply is that it was influenced by the MILF, which it was not, because you can see that Commissioner Abbas was already in government,” Valte said over Radyo ng Bayan.Valte said Abbas was with the Civil Service Commission prior to his Comelec appointment.“Most of his professional life has been spent in government,” Valte said.The Palace also welcomed the MILF’s registration of its newly formed political party called the United Bangsamoro Justice Party (UBJP) with the Comelec.“We want them to be part of society. Whether you get into government is something that your constituents will decide because we have free and democratic elections. But the fact that they are moving to put their organization under a political party for 2016 is better than to bear arms against the government,” Valte said.“It’s a good sign that even if the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) has yet to be passed and is still being discussed in Congress, [the MILF] is moving to be part of the mainstream.”",1
"The Philippine National Police (PNP) Tuesday expressed readiness to investigate officials of local government units (LGUs) who failed to implement appropriate preventive measures to save lives during typhoon “Ompong.”Speaking on Tuesday, Senior Superintendent Benigno Durana Jr., PNP spokesman, said however the decision for the PNP to step in and investigate negligent local officials should be approved first by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).“If we have these kinds of situations [natural disasters], preemptive evacuation is necessary. If the local officials’ efforts and reactions in preparation for typhoon Ompong are enough, that will be looked into by the DILG,” Durana said.The DILG is currently reviewing the performance of at least 10 mayors who have reportedly lacking performance during typhoon Ompong’s onslaught last week.The identities of the local officials were not disclosed, but according to media reports, a DILG official said hinted the mayors were from Cagayan Valley (Region) and the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR).These two regions registered a heavy loss of lives during the onslaught of the typhoon last weekend.As of this writing, the PNP has yet to receive directives from the DILG to help them in investigating the liability of the said officials.“But if the DILG would want us to be involved, definitely. Because the PNP is under the DILG,” Durana said.As of Tuesday, the PNP has recorded 74 fatalities directly as a result of the effects of typhoon “Ompong.”",1
"Mild tectonic earthquakes jolted Davao del Sur province Thursday morning, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said.However, the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (RDRRMC) in Southern Mindanao region reported no damage or injury in the series of tectonic quakes that struck Davao del Sur province on Thursday.Of the eight mild tectonic earthquakes that shook the province of Davao del Sur on Thursday (Aug. 31), a 4.0 magnitude earthquake was the strongest and it was registered at 1:31 a.m., Phivolcs said.The epicenter was traced 27 kilometers (km) northwest from the town proper of Sta.

"Earlier this month, the Senate issued a subpoena to telecommunication companies to provide transcripts of text exchanges between President Benigno Aquino III and Director General Alan Purisima, the former Philippine National Police chief, on Jan. 25, the day 44 members of the PNP’s Special Action Force were killed in a gun battle with Moro rebels after a bungled counterterrorism mission in Mamasapano, Maguindanao province.Text messages between Mr. Aquino and Purisima released by Malacañang in late February showed the President was getting information from the suspended PNP chief, not from an officer within the official PNP or Armed Forces of the Philippines chain of command. It was unclear, however, whether the Palace released all of the text messages between Mr. Aquino and Purisima.The Senate subpoenaed the text messages from the telcos to compare the contents of the transcripts of Purisima’s SMS exchanges with the President that the former PNP chief had submitted.Speaking in the Senate, Purisima read into the record his exchanges with the President from 5:45 a.m. on Jan. 25, when he informed the President about the killing of Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias “Marwan,” to 6:20 p.m., when he texted Mr. Aquino about the heavy casualties suffered by the SAF.In between, Mr. Aquino inquired if the authorities were back to square one with the escape of Marwan’s Filipino associate, Basit Usman, and made clear that the terrorist “should not get away.”After Mr. Aquino texted at 10:16 a.m., it was only Purisima who sent messages between 11:38 a.m. and 6:20 p.m.Purisima updated the President on the killing of Marwan and the SAF clash with the Moro rebels.In an early text, Purisima told the President that the containment forces who were battling guerrillas from the Moro Islamic Liberaton Front (MILF) and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) were “supported by mechanized and artillery support.”But this was apparently not the case, because the tanks and artillery were not yet deployed at that time, and these were not fully used because of the marshy ground and the lack of a forward observer, the senators investigating the clash noted.Purisima told the Senate he texted Mr. Aquino at 5:45 a.m. on Jan. 25 that Marwan had been killed but that his body had to be left behind, and that one SAF trooper was wounded in the operation.Based on his text message to Purisima, Mr. Aquino knew details of the operation and believed that police and military units were available to assist 160 SAF commandos carrying out the mission.“If I remember correctly, 160 SAF troopers were directly involved in this operation plus provisions for other PNP and AFP units to assist,” Mr. Aquino said in his 7:59 a.m. text to Purisima.“The terrain is flat and clear as opposed to upland forested or jungle terrain. Why could they not contain and/or overwhelm the 15-20 members opposing force? Are they still in contact with the two other targets? If not and the opposing force has escaped, are we now back to square one?” the President asked.At 8:17 a.m., Purisima replied: “They are presently in contact with reinforcing elements from BIFF. The containment forces are the ones in contact right now. They are supported by mechanized and artillery support, Sir.”Purisima testified that he based his message to the President about mechanized and artillery support on an SMS to him by Lt. Gen. Rustico Guerrero, chief of the AFP Western Mindanao Command.After receiving the call to assist the SAF troopers under fire, Guerrero told Purisima that there was coordination on the ground, and that “tank, infantry and artillery support are made available.”But in the Senate, Guerrero said his text message meant only that the tanks and artillery were in place, and did not mean these had been deployed.In his last text to the President sent at 6:20 p.m. Purisima said: “Sir, latest report from operating elements in Maguindanao states that the security elements who were engaged by BIFF/MILF elements suffered heavy casualties. They were reportedly overrun. CCH and international monitoring team are in the area retrieving casualties. The main effort is still in the process of rendezvous with other SAF and AFP elements.”Responding to the Senate subpoena, Smart Communications said its system did not allow it to retain the contents of text messages.Telcos later said they did not store their subscribers’ messages. They said they kept records of the time and number of text messages sent and received by subscribers, but not the contents.Industry officials told the Inquirer earlier that while it is theoretically possible to intercept and read subscribers’ text message exchanges, telcos do not.They said that as a matter of policy, telcos do not read or store messages because of the high volume of message traffic in the Philippines.Monitoring and storing all messages would entail significant costs, they said.Source: Inquirer ArchivesRELATED STORIESAquino approves release of textsAquino: Purisima lied to meSmart: No record of Aquino, Purisima texts",1

"“My greatest fear in the bids and awards committee is the AVP by Luis Morelos which the chairman and CEO, Jose Vicente B. Salazar, chose through a rigged selection system. That will be a criminal act.”Thus said the late Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) Director Francisco Jose Villa Jr. in one of a series of “suicide notes” he started writing on Aug. 23, 2016, expressing worries about his role in reviewing procurement contracts at the power industry watchdog.“I have fears about my BAC (bids and awards committee) work,” he added. “Our mistakes may bring on [Commission on Audit] observations and disallowances. Those may affect me financially.”In the evening of Nov. 9, the 54-year-old lawyer took a .38-caliber revolver and shot himself fatally in the Parañaque City residence he shared with his sister, veteran broadcast journalist Charie Villa.Now, his sister wants to turn the spotlight on the fate of her brother, Jun, whom she said felt weighed down by the pressures of being made to clear deals made outside regular and prescribed government processes.(It is unclear what he meant by “AVP by Luis Morelos,” but an ERC insider said this referred to a failed bid for an unspecified institutional audio visual presentation for the agency.)Pressured“Jun was pressured to approve contracts for procurements and hiring consultants without proper bidding and procedure as bids and awards committee chairman,” an emotional Charie Villa said on Thursday after Mass for her brother at Santuario de San Antonio Chapel in Makati City.“He loved his ERC family,” she said. But when pressured to ‘follow’ a ‘maliit na bagay’ (a small matter) which ate the fabric of what he believed in, he couldn’t take the pressure,” she said, adding that her brother “loved and needed his job” and dedicated 13 years of his career to the ERC, often working 12-hour days as he rose to the rank of director.Charie Villa, who spent many years with ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp., said her brother was opposed to the practice of “bidding-biddingan” (mock bidding).Baffled“For those who reject ‘pakisama’ or ‘for the boys’ and are treated ‘uncommon’ or ‘weird’ just because they stand up for what is right and follow the rules and the law, where do they seek redress? Where can they go?” she said. “Jun felt he had nowhere to go.”Sought for comment, ERC Chair Salazar said he viewed “with serious concern and disappointment allegations being hurled against me in the aftermath of the passing away of Director Jun Villa.”“Out of respect for the late Director Villa and for his family, I shall refrain from ascribing any motive to the allegations,” he said in a text message sent to the media.“Director Villa has been a staunch supporter of our efforts at reforming the ERC. He was aware of our firm resolve to keep all bidding and procurement processes transparent and done with integrity. I am, therefore, baffled by the insinuations,” he said.“Despite this, since Director Villa has passed away, I shall not diminish the dignity and nobility of his memory by putting in question the validity of the insinuations,” he added.Salazar said an impartial inquiry by an “objective body” should be conducted on the allegations to be fair to the agency and the memory of the late ERC official.“I hope that all parties concerned would be called, their side taken, and the issue resolved with finality,” he said. “I have always endeavored to promote and protect the transparency and integrity of all bidding and procurement processes in the ERC.”Charie Villa said she would set up a foundation in honor of her late brother where employees who feel pressured for “standing up for what is right can go to seek redress from harassment and legal help.”“Those who refuse to be corrupted by this government system will have a support group, so they have relief,” she said of this proposed organization. “Corruption, like rust, is corrosive.”",1
"It was a moment when President Benigno Aquino III himself needed some words of comfort, as he too was “stunned and shocked” to learn of the passing of the Inquirer editor in chief, Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc.On Monday afternoon, Mr. Aquino paid his last respects to Magsanoc, whose pursuit of press freedom and democracy ran parallel with the struggles of his father, the martyred opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr., during the martial law regime of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.The President arrived at the Aeternum at Heritage Park in Taguig City at a little after4 p.m. and stayed for two hours.Magsanoc’s husband, Carlitos, daughter, Kara Magsanoc-Alikpala, and sons Nico and Marty, and youngest grandchild, 6-year old Maica, welcomed the President.Inside the Aeternum chapel, Mr. Aquino prayed before the urn that held Magsanoc’s ashes, his eyes shut.The President was also scheduled to deliver a eulogy for the late icon of press freedom last night, the last day of the wake.Mr. Aquino told the Magsanocs that he was having Christmas Eve dinner with his family when Inquirer Lifestyle editor, Thelma Sioson San Juan, called up with the tragic news.“According to the President, he was too stunned and shocked. He couldn’t say anything to Thelma to console her because he needed some comforting words himself,” Alikpala said in an interview.Alikpala said Mr. Aquino also told the family “to take their time” in seeking to heal the pain and the loss of LJM, Magsanoc’s initials which everyone at the Inquirer uses to refer to their esteemed and beloved boss.Recognizing the struggle between holding on and letting go, Mr. Aquino told Alikpala that there were times when he would ponder on whether “one should still pray for the loved one to live longer, or ask God to end the suffering.”Even as the President and Magsanoc shared an enduring friendship, it did not keep the feisty and outspoken LJM from sharing with Mr. Aquino her thoughts about his administration and the pressing issues of the day.For LJM, the President she loved and respected was no sacred cow at the Inquirer.The Inquirer published stories and editorials critical of the Aquino administration, including certain appointments he made, the pork barrel scam, the outlawed Disbursement Acceleration Program, and the Metro Manila traffic mess.Alikpala said the President also told her that he and LJM had been texting each other quite often recently.When he learned that LJM could not make it to the 30th anniversary of the Inquirer last Dec. 9, he sent her a text message wishing her to get well soon, Alikpala said.In his speech at the anniversary event, the President hailed the courage of Magsanoc and Inquirer founding chair Eggie Duran-Apostol in bringing real news to the Filipino people, defying the media censorship imposed by the dictator Marcos and writing critical articles during dangerous times.Mr. Aquino called the Inquirer the paper of record in the post-Edsa years and said it was the one “best equipped” to correct the martial law revisionism now taking place, especially in the run-up to the presidential elections next year.Magsanoc herself had said that the Inquirer was the keeper of the Edsa flame.She underscored how the peaceful revolution that toppled the Marcos dictatorship regained for the press its freedom and for the country its democracy.At one point last Monday, the President saw a commercial airline flying over the Aeternum minutes after taking off from the airport and noticed that the landing gear was still out.According to Alikpala, Mr. Aquino said that was quite dangerous.“I asked him if shouldn’t he mention it to the agency responsible for the airlines. In [a matter of] seconds, the President was on the phone with an aviation official telling him about the airline and what he had seen,” she said.“You know, Mom likes the owners but she never really liked their airline,” she said.It was, for all intents and purposes, LJM making her presence felt.There was something that needed to be addressed for the safety of the riding public and she made the President act on it pronto.RELATED STORIESMourning LJMPresident Aquino calls LJM a ‘stalwart of the mosquito press’Aquino on Magsanoc: ‘She always spoke to me frankly’",1

Ask Joyce. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, the two additional sources I have for this article claim that they used to be part of Ramirez’s social media influencer fleet, but they had a falling out because Ramirez is a cheapskate, i.e. they said she doesn't pay people well.First Source spills beans on #NasaanAngPangulo I shall conceal the identities of the other two sources because doing otherwise may jeopardize their livelihood. I will, however, provide some relevant – VERY RELEVANT – screenshots.Both sources, who we shall call Source 1 and Source 2, were part of Ramirez's fleet of social media influencers, i.e. they were part of the twitter campaigns Ramirez commandeered. Referring to Ramirez, Source 1 said:“Nakalimutan nya yata na madaldal sya dati. Hahahaha! Kaya tigilan niya mga paninira n'ya dahil madaldal sya! Hahaha!” Source 1 then gave me three screenshots allegedly showing Ramirez’s instant messages (IMs) dated 29 January 2015. I have redacted other IMs to protect my source’s identity, then combined Ramirez’s IM’s into one neat graphic.""INTERXN"" is what Ramirez calls her fleet of social media influencers.Based on the screenshots, Ramirez wrote:“We have a special assignment. Can we trend 6PM later? It is special political operations.” Six p.m. of 29 January 2015? That's exactly what Lopez told me!Ramirez added:“Our assignment is to amplify that PNoy snubbed the 44 dead policemen.” Ramirez appears to be referring to the arrival of the bodies of 44 Special Action Forces (SAF) slain in the botched Mamasapano Clash. Pnoy was absent during the arrival ceremony, attending instead the opening of a car plant somewhere in South Luzon.Ramirez wrote:“Tweets about heroism, PNoy not showing up at the rites, being a coward, shame, etc.” I think it’s clear now that the supposed Twitter campaign is against Pnoy.“Big money on the line for the team as much as P250K (Php 250,000) each but per INTERXN policy each must present work delivery in prep for the elections.” Joyce may have been referring to her influencer fleet when she said “team” and the payment per influence when she said “P250K”.Interestingly, she said “in prep for the elections”. Was she intending to use a supposedly confidential black propaganda operation as marketing material from the onset?I mean, I dislike Roxas, but I kinda feel bad for him in this particular aspect of the matter.But we’re not done yet.#WishKoKayPNoy: 2nd Source, 2nd Campaign My second source, another former member of Ramirez’s social media influencer fleet, provided me screenshots of their group chats, where Ramirez appeared to be providing specific instructions for yet another anti-Pnoy social media black propaganda campaign.In the screenshot, Ramirez wrote:“Wag masyado hard sell kay Mar ha and pumili kayo matinong photos wag yung mukang stunt PR (sic). Act like news outlets.” Before we go any further, it’s worthy to note that Ramirez used #NasaanAngPangulo on her own company’s twitter accounts:Ramirez's company Publicy Asia / PRAsiaWorldwide owns @INTERXNShe even appeared to be glad that the hashtag was featured on TV Patrol!But of course, those two screenshots are just circumstantial evidence.My mentor, Manila Standard columnist and former editor-in-chief Jojo Robles , taught me how to treat sources. He said I should always wait for a second independent source to corroborate what my first source said. And because I am a very obedient student, I looked for not only one, but two other sources for this issue.Now that we've gotten that out of the way, the two additional sources I have for this article claim that they used to be part of Ramirez’s social media influencer fleet, but they had a falling out because Ramirez is a cheapskate, i.e. they said she doesn't pay people well.I shall conceal the identities of the other two sources because doing otherwise may jeopardize their livelihood.

Aktibista ka lang talaga, Joyce? Talaga lang?Orders from up above? Based on the evidence, Ramirez appeared to have machinated at least two Twitter campaigns against Roxas’s own principal, President Benigno Aquino III, with the second campaign launched barely a week after the first.Based on another screenshot, Joyce was acting on someone else’s orders, presumably from DILG Usec. Tom Villarin, basing on Lopez’s information.Ramirez wrote:“Eto daw #WishKoKayPNoy inject positive images na si Mar Roxas ang humarap sa burol so paki-Google photos positive spin for Mar pero wag hard sell or halata. Photos na lang ikalat no words let the people comment wag tayo.” One of her influencers replied with a photo, and Ramirez responded with:“Yes, mga ganyan. Discreet kundi aawayin tayo ng lahat.” Judging from the 08 February #WishKoKayPnoy sample tweet, this exchange of IMs happened around 08 February 2015.And yes, it appears that Mar Roxas is indeed the beneficiary of both Twitter campaigns.But Pnoy’s loyal minions in Malacañang seem to have caught wind of Ramirez’s online operations.The IM was accompanied by a sample tweet that reads:The sample tweet included photos of Roxas taken during the SAF 44 arrival ceremonies.Based on the evidence, Ramirez appeared to have machinated at least two Twitter campaigns against Roxas’s own principal, President Benigno Aquino III, with the second campaign launched barely a week after the first.Based on another screenshot, Joyce was acting on someone else’s orders, presumably from DILG Usec.

Remember to always keep neutral. Delete muna any post na may government related content cos we are being monitored daw by government kahit wala naman tayo pinost na masama for your safety thanks.” Ok, hold on one second!FIRST, it’s clear that the two twitter campaigns #NasaanAngPangulo and #WishKoKayPnoy were intended to discredit then President Aquino, so I do not understand how Ramirez could say that “they’re not doing anything bad”.SECOND, it’s also difficult to understand how Ramirez’s fleet of influencers can “keep neutral”, since the two campaigns specifically are black propaganda. Thus, I can only surmise that Ramirez meant the exercise of greater subtlety among her minions.THIRD, it’s interesting that Ramirez seems to have acknowledged the presence of a Pnoy-era online monitoring team. Was Ramirez referring to the “Malacañang Call Center” that former PCDSPO chief Ricky Carandang reportedly created? Was Ramirez referring to the the same Aquino-era Malacañang Call Center where Palace-sponsored cyber operations – including troll operations – allegedly took place?And by the way, Pinoy Ako Blog’s On 18 February 2015, or a little over a week later, Ramirez re-emerged in the group chat.Ramirez wrote:Ok, hold on one second!, it’s clear that the two twitter campaigns #NasaanAngPangulo and #WishKoKayPnoy were intended to discredit then President Aquino, so I do not understand how Ramirez could say that “they’re not doing anything bad”.it’s also difficult to understand how Ramirez’s fleet of influencers can “keep neutral”, since the two campaigns specifically are black propaganda.

Ask Roosevelt.Coincidence? Ask Roosevelt.Regardless, what’s clear here is that whatever deal Ramirez had with the Roxas camp was more than just a one-off affair and that Ramirez loves sipping her own Kool-Aid.But it gets even more interesting from here.Like a scorned loverApparently referring to Roxas, Ramirez wrote:""Di man lang niya isipin puwede natin siya ituro for destabilization."" In an earlier conversation and based onRamirez replied:“Told yah. It’s him.” According to the screenie, the influencer even offered to save the pictures as evidence.Ramirez also wrote:“Hard mo na masusuka tao sa kanya not branding.” Judging from his screenshot, Ramirez ordered the influencer to hard-sell Mar Roxas, which is the total opposite of her orders at the beginning, which was to subtly sell Mar Roxas and nothing more.Hard selling means blatantly and shamelessly promoting something. This tactic is generally frowned upon by the PR community because it is usually off-putting for target audience.Essentially, Ramirez seems to have instructed her influencers to hard sell Roxas, i.e. still fulfill her agreement with the Roxas camp while sabotaging it at the same time.Ramirez apparently went as far as threatening to preserve evidence about their transactions when she wrote:“Beat your own prof losers. Evidence pa ha. DILG making orders against PNoy so stupid.” Yes, at this point, it appears that Ramirez is sabotaging her own client.It's interesting that Ramirez has so much confidence on her PR skills. I mean, if she's really good, then why am I writing this article right now?But how did it come to this point? Why did these even happen?Money. Money, Money Another screenshot from 25 February 2015 provides more insight about the why behind the what:Based on the image, Ramirez wrote:“Ibabasura ko yang Mar hanggang ngayon di nagbabayad puro utos ang DILG ang kakapal.”Ramirez, presumably out of anger or sheer disappointment, called Mar a “squatter”. But another screenshot suggests that her vendetta didn’t end there:Ramirez wrote:“Villarin DILG Usec. Wala bayad as if. Sa sobrang galit ko pinadala ko kay VP Binay.” Ramirez posted an image showing her message to then Vice-president Jejomar Binay’s camp, which reads:“BayanMuna and the reaffirmist groups are one of the primary movers behind the oust Pnoy activities. They join VP Binay, Peping Cojuangco, GMA, the Napoles senators and corrupt businessmen like Bobby Ongpin in an unholy alliance to use the #saf44 as a way to oust PNoy. To the SAF, PNP, and AFP remember that these communists are the same ones responsible together with the NPA of (sic) killing thousands of your brothers in arms. Huwag magpapagamit sa mga communista!!!” I am not sure if Ramirez was telling the truth here, especially since she appears to be spiteful during the times those messages were sent. What’s clear, however, is that she may have committed a major mistake: she sent Binay a message that is against Binay.I guess that’s why my sources told me that the Binays never hired her.If I were a Binay and after seeing that, why the hell would I? VP Binay, good call!At some point, Ramirez seems to have become unhappy with her deal with Roxas’ camp, as evidenced by a screenshot of her chat with one of her then-closest influencers, provided to me by no less than that influencer himself/herself.Apparently referring to Roxas, Ramirez wrote:In an earlier conversation and based on pronoun antecedents , the influencer asked her if it’s really Mar Roxas who ordered the black propaganda campaigns:Ramirez replied:According to the screenie, the influencer even offered to save the pictures as evidence.Ramirez also wrote:Judging from his screenshot, Ramirez ordered the influencer to hard-sell Mar Roxas, which is the total opposite of her orders at the beginning, which was to subtly sell Mar Roxas and nothing more.Hard selling means blatantly and shamelessly promoting something.

However, let me raise some points that you may have missed out on.Two factions,In as far as presidentiables, Roxas headed the “Balay Faction” while Binay headed “Samar”. At the time, Roxas’ presidential hopes were in danger because VP Binay’s was consistently outperforming him in popularity surveys.Evidence suggests that Roxas’ Usec. Tom Villarin was Joyce Ramirez’s contact, i.e. the one who calls the shots in as far as the two black propaganda campaigns are concerned. Villarin, along with the pretty much the rest of Akbayan Partylist, was affiliated with the Balay Faction, i.e. it is in Villarin’s interest to make Roxas win in 2016.Given available data, it is entirely possible that Villarin and Akbayan launched the aforementioned black propaganda campaign without Roxas’ consent. On the flip side, however, Villarin is pretty much Roxas’ right-hand man in those days, so it’s quite hard to believe that Roxas knew nothing of the operations.After all, have all SM employees personally met Henry Sy?Evidence clearly suggests that that Akbayan Partylist – where Senator Risa Hontiveros belongs – is into black propaganda. Surely, Villarin would not have acted on his own because such a massive black ops requires thorough coordination and funding.But I guess they fell short on funding because Ramirez was pissed.Regardless, I think this adds new color to the recent I think that you, the reader, have come up with your own conclusions about this issue based on what you’re read in this article.

One of the persons in the picture is actually not even European: it’s Tom Villarin.The brown guy is Tom Villarin.A gentle warning to current and former clients As promised in the disclaimers, I took every step to ensure that none of Ramirez’s post-Roxas clients will get entangled in this article, for the simple reason that they may not have been aware of Ramirez’s proclivities.You are politicians. You need publicity to survive. I understand that perfectly. Besides, I do not like burning bridges unnecessarily.I know all of you, and I think that all of you, despite your respective flaws, have the potential to change this country for the better. Don’t let Ramirez take that opportunity away from you.With that said, I think I now understand why oppositionists like Pinoy Ako Blog accuse me of being a paid hack, because it seems that most political content creators in the past were on the payroll of some PR operator, so they thought I’m cut from the same cloth.I’m sorry to disappoint you, but the best thing I got from any politician is free food.But of course, I do not speak for the other bloggers, like those who pulled the “Poe-Cayetano 2022” issue out of their own @$$. Who knows, would it be outlandish to suspect that they're on Ramirez's payroll too!?Anyway, let me finish this article with this piece of advice for Miss Ramirez:Joyce, you need a career shift. Mag-TESDA ka na! Note, however, that based on the data provided above, it’s best for you to find ways to ensure that Ramirez will not do to you the same thing she did to Roxas.I know all of you, and I think that all of you, despite your respective flaws, have the potential to change this country for the better. Don’t let Ramirez take that opportunity away from you.With that said, I think I now understand why oppositionists like Pinoy Ako Blog accuse me of being a paid hack, because it seems that most political content creators in the past were on the payroll of some PR operator, so they thought I’m cut from the same cloth.I’m sorry to disappoint you, but the best thing I got from any politician is free food.Anyway, let me finish this article with this piece of advice for Miss Ramirez:DONT FORGET TO SHARE!Did you like this post? Help ThinkingPinoy stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help! Just click the link below! :-)RELATED POSTS:During my first two hours speaking at the #CocoyGate #SenateHearing and possibly owing to first time jitters, the #NasaanAngPangulo scandal accidentally slipped my tongue. I was really very nervous then, and since I swore to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, I virtually told every truth that was in my mind at the time.In PR terms, I think that slip of mine was a miscalculation, no matter how minor. That slip could have totally derailed the #CocoyGate issue, so I was really relieved that it didn’t. Regardless, mainstream media “tried” to report on it: “tried” because the articles that came out were essentially slanted in favor of the accused, with none of them – except GMA News (Thank you!) – asking for my side.Truth be told, I have already lost interest on the #NasaanAngPangulo issue, until one of my little birds told me a few days ago that the PR operator mentioned in my article – PR Asia Worldwide’s Joyce Ramirez – ordered her fleet of social media allies to attack me online. I think my very highly placed little birds have no motive to lie, so I think it’s reasonable to say, from my end, that Ramirez committed an egregious mistake.You see, I am not the kind of guy who lays all his cards on the table. I always leave a couple of aces up my sleeve for use if and when the need arises. Suffice it to say, let me use one of them against Ramirez today.In the February 2017 ThinkingPinoy article “ #NasaanAngPangulo: Mamasapano, Mar Roxas’ Ambition, and a PR operator ”, I explained that a friend, former National Youth Commissioner and former MTRCB member Michael “Mike” Acebedo Lopez, told me a really good story.Lopez said that in 2015, then DILG Secretary Mar Roxas, in a desperate attempt to salvage his presidential ambitions, engaged in a multi-million peso black propaganda campaign against then President Benigno “PNoy” Aquino, a campaign that aimed at pinning all the blame on the latter over the SAF44-Mamasapano Scandal, effectively shielding Roxas from Mamasapano-related bad press.According to Lopez, close Roxas aide and then DILG Usec. Tomasito “Tom” Villarin commissioned publicist (i.e. PR operator) Joyce Ramirez to launch a Mamasapano-related Twitter campaign focused specifically against PNoy, in the hopes of minimizing the bad publicity that his principal Mar Roxas, a de facto superior of the SAF 44 policemen, would receive.Lopez did not specifically name Ramirez, but other sources provided me with that information.Lopez, who has a hatred of all things yellow, said he helped Ramirez by providing a list of Twitter hashtag, one of which was the “legendary” #NasaanAngPangulo, the hashtag used for the anti-Pnoy campaign that was launched at exactly 6:00 PM Manila on 29 January 2015.Lopez said Ramirez maintains business connections with major social media players, which allows her to force any issue into the Twitter trending list and like clockwork, #NasaanAngPangulo trended worldwide shortly after its launch.As evidence, I provided an excel file that was last modified in 2015, showing Joyce Ramirez as its author. The excel file basically used the #NasaanAngPangulo campaign as case study that she used for pitching her services to other politicians.Roxas has since denied links with Ramirez and #NasaanAngPangulo. But that's expected.Meanwhile, Ramirez reacted to my revelation at the Senate with a statement, part of which reads:Referring to ThinkingPinoy, Ramirez also said Unlike many people, I am immune to name calling, so I’ll let that second quotation go. Actually, I was even tempted to let the entire thing go because Ramirez, while an interesting figure, is a very small fish to fry. I think she’s a waste of cooking oil.But based on what my little birds told me, her recent actions warrant an Armageddon.According to my little birds, Ramirez recently ordered her fleet of pro-Duterte influencers to attack my page. I don’t exactly know what triggered her, especially since I never really mentioned her or anything related to her during the past couple of weeks.Well, a few minor social media players tried to attack me recently. They called the #CocoyGate Senate Hearing “a little Poe-Cayetano 2022 show”, which, I feel, shows total disrespect for Senator Grace Poe who could not have handled the hearing more fairly. ( Thank you, Grace. Are they part of Ramirez’s fleet? I don’t know, but quoting Roosevelt:Well, I’ll fart on them rainbows that smell like World Peace with a hint of cinnamon.",0
"CIVILIANS remain the biggest casualties in the intensified campaign against illegal drugs since the Duterte Administration took over on July 1, 2016, data from the Philippine National Police (PNP) revealed over the weekend.Figures from the Directorate for Investigative and Detective Management (DIDM) showed that from July 1, 2016 to October 12, 2016, 1,959 incidents were monitored by the police wherein 2,151 persons were found dead or killed in legitimate anti-drug operations.Of those killed, civilians constituted the bulk — 2,046 — followed by 47 government employees, 33 elected government officials, 15 police personnel and 10 members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.The same data also revealed that in the same period, police recorded or investigated 530 incidents wherein 550 people were killed. Of the 530 recorded incidents of killings of drug suspects, 66 were allegedly perpetrated by “Motorcycle Riding Criminals,” 530 were already considered “case closed” and 345 others “case solved.”The PNP-DIDM explained that a case is considered closed if one of the offenders has been identified and there was sufficient evidence to charge him in court.On the other hand, a case is considered solved when the offender has been identified, taken into custody and has been charged before the prosecutor’s office or appropriate court.The PNP-DIDM data showed that as of 6 a.m. of October 15, 1,645 drug suspects have been killed since July 1.The National Capital Region (NCR) or Metro Manila has the most number of drug suspects killed at 514 followed by Central Luzon with 283 drug suspects killed.Rounding the top five regions with the most drug suspects killed are Southern Tagalog with 201 killed, Central Visayas, 117 and SOCCSKARGEN, 59.During the same period, police have arrested 29,331 drug suspects with the NCR accounting for the most number of those arrested at 6,958.The other regions with the most drug suspects arrested were Southern Tagalog with 5,097 followed by Central Luzon, 3,618, and Central Visayas, 2,463.Rounding the top five regions with the most number of drug suspects arrested was Northern Mindanao with 1,365 drug suspects nabbed by the police.Under the PNP’s “Oplan Tokhang,” 2,120,139 houses were visited by the police, resulting in the surrender of 744,916 drug suspects.Of those who surrendered, 690,687 are suspected drug users while 54,229 are suspected drug pushers.",1
"The Archdiocese of Cebu issued guidelines and reminders for Catholics and the general public who would want to pay their last respects to the late Cebu Archbishop Emeritus Ricardo Cardinal Vidal.“Please no direct taking of pictures of Cardinal Vidal inside the coffin, let us go there to offer prayers and out of respect also the sacredness of the place… While inside the church, the city government has asked us also to inform people that they should refrain from taking selfies for security reasons,” Cebu Archdiocese Media Liaison Officer Msgr. Joseph Tan told the Manila Bulletin Saturday.Cardinal Vidal’s wake will end before midnight on Wednesday.He will be laid to rest in the morning of the following day.On October 26, the archdiocese said the public is discouraged from bringing backpacks and other bags as they attend the funeral mass at 9 a.m. so as not to delay security inspection.“On the first hour of Thursday, the Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral will be closed since we are scheduled to clean up the parish and organize everything for Cardinal’s burial. We will reopen it to admit the public only in the morning at 7 a.m.,” Tan said.The spokesperson of the archdiocese said seats will be reserved for church leaders and top government officials while seats for the general public will be on a first-come, first-served basis.Right after the mass, Tan said a short procession will commence on the roads surrounding the mother parish before Vidal’s body will be buried at the mausoleum adjacent to the cathedral.The structure, which is currently being refurbished, can only accommodate a select few due to limited space.“But we will have the whole ceremony televised, shown on LED-screens inside the church and its surrounding areas so that the public can witness,” Tan noted.The mausoleum, which was completed in February 1983, serves as a holy resting place for the remains of bishops and clergy of Cebu.His eminence will be the sixth prelate who will be interred in the crypt.Entombed in the mausoleum are Cebu Archbishop Julio Cardinal Rosales, Bishop Emeritus of Calbayog Sincero Lucero, Cebu Archbishop Manuel Salvador, Archbishop Emeritus of Lipa Mariano G. Gaviola, and Bishop of Cebu Msgr. Juan Gorordo.According to Tan, 11 church leaders have already confirmed to fly to Cebu within the coming days to pay their last respects to the country’s oldest cardinal who shepherd the Cebuano Catholics for 29 years.",1
"SEN. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara on Sunday appealed to members of the House of Representatives to pass the Expanded Maternity Leave bill that would allow mothers to spend more time with their babies.Angara, one of the authors of Senate Bill 1305 which was approved on third and final reading in March 2017, said the enactment of the measure would provide mothers longer period to care and breastfeed their babies.SB 1305 seeks to increase maternity leave from 60 days to 120 days. It also aims to grant an additional 30 days for solo working mothers.“To lengthen maternity benefits is to safeguard our nation’s future,” Angara said in a statement.Under SB 1305, 30 days of the proposed 120-day maternity leave are transferrable to alternate caregivers including the child’s father, the mother’s common-law partner, and relatives up to the fourth degree of consanguinity.The measure also entitles adoptive parents of minor children to 30 days of parental leave.House Bill 4113 that seeks to expand maternity leave from 60 days to 100 days, had been awaiting approval on second reading since January 2017.Angara, in emphasizing the importance of providing mothers more time to breastfeed their babies, cited the 2013 World Health Organization report which showed that the Philippines had a breastfeeding rate of only 34 percent for infants younger than six months.Based on the 2015 Nutritional Status of Filipinos, one in every three Filipino children aged five years old and younger is stunted.Angara noted that mother’s milk is second to none in terms of its nutritional and economic value. While doubling the number of paid maternity leave days would incur costs to businesses and may affect productivity, its social and familial benefits would far outweigh the costs, the senator said.“Every mother—or every parent for that matter—should be afforded ample time and opportunity to care for their children. We should not pass the chance for us to take care of them,” he added.The country is now celebrating the National Breastfeeding Awareness Month and this year’s theme is “Breastfeeding: Foundation for Life.",1
"Remember Sarah Palin’s famous words, “I can see Russia from my house?” Well, those words have now come to haunt her native Alaska.Moments after President Vladimir Putin officially declared that Crimea in Ukraine is now officially part of Russia, he announced before the Russian Parliament that Alaska is next in the country’s ongoing territorial expansion.A signing ceremony Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Prime Minister of Crimea and the mayor of the city of Sevastopol made Crimea’s annexation official, the Kremlin said in a statement.Putin has sent Palin an invitation to Moscow to discuss the next steps in officially making Alaska a part of Russia. “Russia and Alaska have many things in common, Putin said, “including cold winters, cold people, clueless politicians, Christianity, even history.”The earliest written accounts indicate that the first Europeans to reach Alaska came from Russia. In 1648 Semyon Dezhnev sailed from the mouth of the Kolyma River through the Arctic Ocean and around the eastern tip of Asia to the Anadyr River. One legend holds that some of his boats were carried off course and reached Alaska. “Russia discovered Alaska,” Putin said.Unconfirmed reports say that Putin offered Palin the vice presidency of Russia should Alaska agree to the annexation.The White House has declined to comment on Putin’s announcement, saying “we don’t comment on pending matters.”",0
"Was the TRAIN railroaded by the House of Representatives?ACT Teachers Rep. Antonio Tinio questioned the ratification of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) bill past 10 p.m. on Wednesday, citing the lack of voting or even a quorum.This was not the only last-minute snag faced by the tax measure on the last day of Congress’ session for the year.The Senate ratification of the bicameral conference committee report, which reconciled conflicting provisions in the two chambers’ bills, also took place past 10 in the evening.This was because Senators Loren Legarda and Joel Villanueva initially said the repeal of the tax exemption of locally produced coal was “deleted” from the report, a claim that House Deputy Speaker Miro Quimbo denied.Voting in the Senate (16-4) pushed through as a result of a compromise on coal that the two panels reached at a meeting after the joint session of Congress on Wednesday.Exempted from VATUnder the reconciled TRAIN bill, the local coal industry would pay an excise tax but would be exempt from the 12-percent value added tax (VAT).“Excise tax agreed to will apply to both imported and domestic coal. Current VAT exemption stays,” said Sen. Sonny Angara.The reconciled bill would lower the personal income tax of salary-earners but raises the excise tax on a number of goods and services like petroleum products, automobiles, tobacco, sugar-sweetened beverages and cosmetic procedures.Tinio said there were barely 10 people on the floor when Deputy Speaker Raneo Abu, who presided over the session, approved the motion of Deputy Majority Leader Arthur Defensor Jr. to ratify the bicameral conference committee report.“Any objection? There is none. The motion is approved,” Abu said, ignoring Tinio’s screams of “Mr. Speaker, objection! Objection!”Over in 2 minutesUnlike in the Senate, no voting took place in the House. The adoption was over in just the last two minutes of the six-hour plenary session.Tinio called the ratification “a total farce and travesty of so-called representative democracy,” saying lawmakers were not even furnished copies of the final report before its adoption.He claimed many lawmakers were partying with PDP-Laban in a five-star hotel while imposing burdensome taxes on the people.Tinio cited Rule X, Sec. 63 of the Rules of the House of Representatives, which stated: “A conference committee report shall be ratified by a majority vote of the members of the House present, there being a quorum.”“Since there was no quorum and no actual vote was taken, the alleged ratification is clearly invalid,” he told reporters.His ally, Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate, said in a separate statement that the Makabayan party-list bloc was studying options to question and stop the railroaded tax package.“Obviously, the runaway train that would wreak havoc on our people with new burdensome taxes was not validly ratified,” Zarate said.Presumption of regularityBut such a legal challenge would have to overcome the presumption of regularity in official actions, said Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, who did not receive a copy of the report either.In a press conference, Lagman said he was in his office waiting for the copies of the report to arrive—only to hear over the sound system that it was being adopted right then and there.“I think there was a violation of the rules of plenary. It can always be challenged but there are always presumptions,” he said.Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas told reporters that House members could contest the presiding officer’s report for the session by “bring[ing] it to the attention of plenary or, if not contented, to the courts.”CoalThe tax exemption for local coal producers under Sections 16(a), 16(b) and 17(a) of Presidential Decree No. 972, meanwhile, survived the night.As incentive for local coal producers, then President Ferdinand Marcos granted them exemption from all taxes except income tax, as well as payment of tariff duties and compensating tax on imported equipment.Quimbo said it was “incorrect” to say that provision was repealed because “the House [contingent] never agreed to that repealing clause” during the deliberations.Under the reconciled bill, the coal excise tax would be raised from P10 per metric ton to P50 per metric ton in the first year of TRAIN’s implementation: P50 in the second year and P150 in the third and succeeding years.The P10 coal excise tax rate had remained unchanged since 1988 while the local industry had been exempted from paying excise tax since 1976, according to the Senate committee on ways and means.Government stands to lose P5 billion if local coal continued to be exempted from taxation, according to Legarda and Villanueva. One company, the Consunji Group, is producing 95 percent of coal in the country, Villanueva said.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said on Thursday the administration expected to collect P120 billion from the TRAIN measure and other complementary measures.He said the TRAIN measure would fund the “Build, Build, Build” program, the administration’s “strategy in dealing with poverty in general.”",1
"and with Washington refusing to rule out a military strike in response.A spokesman for the North’s foreign ministry said Pyongyang was “fully ready to respond to any option taken by the US”.The regime will continue bolstering its “preemptive nuclear attack” capabilities unless Washington scrapped its hostile policies, he said in a statement carried by the state-run KCNA news agency.“The DPRK’s measures for bolstering the nuclear force to the maximum will be taken in a consecutive and successive way at any moment and any place decided by its supreme leadership,” the spokesman added, apparently referring to a sixth nuclear test and using the North’s official name, the Democratic Republic of Korea.The North has carried out five nuclear tests in the last 11 years and is widely believed to be making progress towards its dream of building a missile capable of delivering a warhead to the continental United States.It raises the tone of its warnings every spring, when Washington and Seoul carry out joint exercises it condemns as rehearsals for invasion, but this time fears of conflict have been fuelled by a cycle of threats from both sides.The joint drills have just ended, but naval exercises are continuing in the Sea of Japan (East Sea) with a US strike group led by the aircraft carrier US Carl Vinson.The Pyongyang foreign ministry spokesman said if the North was not armed with “the powerful nuclear force”, Washington would have “committed without hesitation the same brigandish aggression act in Korea as what it committed against other countries”.The statement reasserts the North’s long-running rhetoric on its military capabilities.Seoul also regularly warns that Pyongyang can carry out a test whenever it decides to do so.Pyongyang’s latest attempted show of force was a failed missile test on Saturday that came just hours after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson pressed the UN Security Council to do more to push the North into abandoning its weapons program.Tillerson warned the UN Security Council last week of “catastrophic consequences” if the world does not act and said that military options for dealing with the North were still “on the table”.In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS television network’s “Face the Nation” program, Trump said that if North Korea carries out another nuclear test “I would not be happy”.Asked if “not happy” signified “military action”, Trump answered: “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see.”",1
"The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) says Quick Response Funds (QRF) are “built-in budgetary allocations that represent predisaster or standby funds for agencies in order to immediately assist areas stricken by catastrophes and crises.” The QRF can be used for DRR.The QRF is lodged in the budgets of public works and highways, national defense, education, social welfare, agriculture, and civil defense departments.During calamities, local government units (LGUs) can also tap at least 5 percent of their local revenues “to support disaster risk management activities,” Section 21 of the PDRRMA says.In the 2016 General Appropriations Act, Congress provided for QRF of P6.2 billion and Calamity Fund (CF) of P9 billion.As of Sept. 30, 2016, the unused National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (NDRRMF) stands at P18.433 billion (from the original allocation of P18.896 billion).As of June 30, the unspent allocation for Yolanda housing assistance stands at P20.7 billion (from P25.6 billion).The remaining balance of the NDRRMF for 2015 and 2016: P2.548 billion (2015) and P32.968 billion (2016).Sources: Office of Sen.

"Transport network vehicle services (TNVS) such as Grab are mandated to grant students, senior citizens and persons with disability (PWD) a 20 percent discount.This was pointed out by Sen. Jose Edgardo Angara over the weekend amid complaints in social media that Grab refuses to grant discount to students.“We remind them that they are obligated to grant discount not only to students but also to senior citizens and PWD,” Angara said in a radio interview.“We call on the LTFRB [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] to look into this matter and penalize the violators,” he added.He said the 20 percent fare discount for the elderly and PWD are mandated under Republic Act 9442 or the amended Magna Carta for Persons with Disability and RA 9994 or the Expanded Senior Citizens Act.Both laws provide for a 20 percent discount on land, air, sea transportation; food and medicines; medical and dental services; hotels; and sports and other recreational centers, among others.On top of the 20 percent discount, RA 9994 also grants 12-percent value-added tax exemption to senior citizens, while RA 10754 exempts PWD from VAT.On the other hand, LTFRB’s Memorandum Circular 2011-004 grants the fare discount for students but only for land transportation including jeepneys, buses, UV Express vans, taxis and TNVS, while Memorandum Circular 2017-024 allows students to avail of the fare discount even on weekends, holidays and breaks.Angara is pushing for the institutionalization of such student fare discount by making it a law.His proposed measure would expand the coverage of the 20 percent student fare discount to not only include land transportation but also air, water and rail transport, and will make the discount effective all year round.“Let’s lessen the hardship of parents in sending their children to school,” the senator said.“One way is by cutting the transportation expenses of the students. A few pesos saved from the fare discount can be used for their other needs,” Angara added.The LTFRB said those who fail to grant the 20 percent discount will face a P5,000 penalty for the first offense.Repeat offenders will have their unit impounded for 30 days and the operator will be fined P10,000.Those who violate for the third time will be slapped a P15,000 fine, and have their franchise canceled.",1
"Most Rev. Ricardo L. Baccay of the Diocese of Alaminos, Pangasinan has called on the Roman Catholic faithful to shun vices and be wiser in spending money that may be used in more fruitful endeavors.Baccay cited developments in the sin tax law where lawmakers proposed House Bill (HB) 4144, which imposes higher sin tax rates than intended in original provisions of the law.“In addition to what Archbishop [Oscar] Cruz said earlier, if you smoke a pack of cigarettes daily, you more or less spend P45.00 each time. That equates to P1,350.00 a month that may be added to your family’s monthly spendings,” he said in a statement.Earlier reports said Dagupan Archbishop Emeritus Oscar Cruz had praised HB 4144 as a “pro-health” measure in his Radio Veritas program.The vocal archbishop cited data from the Social Weather Stations (SWS) that 10 Filipinos die every hour daily from smoking-related diseases.He said the government’s objective is to ultimately stop vices and he urged citizens to spend their money on more important needs.Archbishop Emeritus Diosdado Talamayan of the Archdiocese of Tuguegarao, meanwhile, commended lawmakers for passing the bill since it helps Filipino farmers in their livelihood.Talamayan hails from Cagayan, one of the North’s tobacco-rich provinces and where many churchgoers are tobacco farmers who depend on the crop to support their families.",1

"Who’s afraid of Juan Ponce Enrile?As far as his daughter Katrina is concerned, no one should be.Enrile is returning to the Senate Monday as minority leader following his temporary release on a P1.4-million bail while the plunder case against him is being tried.“What are they afraid of? My father will not do anything. He will just work. There is nothing to fear,” Katrina said in a radio interview on Sunday.She said that during her father’s detention for over one year, he had just been quiet and the family was equally quiet because they were just waiting for his day in court.Enrile has been charged with pocketing P172 million in kickbacks in connection with the diversion of his allocations from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), a pork barrel, in schemes allegedly masterminded by detained businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles. He has denied wrongdoing.“It’s in the court. So let the wheels of justice take its course. I do not understand why the fear of him going back to the Senate … . My father has not been making any statements. What do they want for me to tell, ‘Dad, shut up’? What do they want?” Katrina said.Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, an administration ally who has locked horns with Enrile on the Senate floor, has said that Enrile’s return could be a “game changer” in the final months of President Aquino’s administration.Enrile’s resumption of his duties in the Senate coincides with the plenary on the proposed charter for a Bangsamoro entity, centerpiece of a peace agreement signed last year between the Aquino administration and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).Sen. Vicente Sotto III said Enrile’s presence was “very timely,” pointing out the start of debates on the 2016 national budget and the substitute bill on the administration’s draft Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL).The Palace timetable on the proposed BBL has been delayed following the massacre of 44 police commandos on Jan. 25 while on a mission to take out international terrorists in Mamasapano, Maguindanao province, under MILF control.“Enrile never relinquished his post as Senate minority leader,” Sotto said. “I was in acting capacity because I am deputy or assistant minority leader.”The 91-year-old Enrile walked out of hospital detention on Thursday after he was granted bail on humanitarian grounds by the Supreme Court.Justice Secretary Leila de Lima has said the government should appeal the Supreme Court ruling granting Enrile bail. Malacañang said Aquino wanted the ruling clarified because it was “essentially unchartered territory.”‘Banana republic’De Lima said Enrile’s release set back the state of the country’s justice system to that of a “banana republic,” noting that the court decision favored the elite.On Sunday, deputy presidential spokesperson Abigal Valte said the Palace legal team would review the court ruling and “see how we can move forward from it.”“This is a new doctrine. There is really much clarification that would be necessary, especially relative to the parameters of the bail,” Valte said over state radio.Katrina said she understood De Lima’s sentiments as justice secretary.“They have to understand that every Filipino has rights, including my father, whether they like my father or not, he is a Filipino, he has rights, he has human rights,” Katrina said in the radio interview.She declined to comment on the Palace moves against her father. “It’s a little tiring to do so,” she said.Sen. JV Ejercito said he was looking forward to Enrile’s return to the Senate.Rejuvenated blocEjercito, one of four members of the minority that included Enrile, Sotto and Sen. Nancy Binay, said Enrile would be a big help to the opposition bloc that had been decimated. Senators Jinggoy Estrada and Ramon Revilla are under detention in connection with the pork barrel scam.Ejercito told a radio station that the high court had stated its reasons for granting Enrile his bail petition.“As I’ve always said, we are a government of laws. Let’s respect the decision,” he said.Ejercito reiterated the need for the Palace to respect the ruling as well. He said President Aquino’s statement that the court ruling should be reviewed was “quite scary.”RELATED STORIESEnrile ‘confident’ SC will treat his case ‘positively,’ says daughter KatrinaEnrile tells children: ‘I’ll be back’",1

"President-elect Rody Duterte is now in a word-war with the Catholic Church bishops after he received continues critics from the institution for being an anti-life and immoral. Ever since the campaign period, bishops of the church were active on campaigning against Duterte.On Monday, Duterte blasted the church again. The tough-talking President said that he will impose the 3-child policy in the country as one of the mitigating factors in dealing with massive poverty and overpopulation.With the policy, he will be expecting the catholic church to hinder his plan. The church has opposed the reproductive health bill before. Despite of the opposition, in 2012, the reproductive bill was passed into a law which Duterte wanted to enhance and enforce by introducing the three-child policy.“I’m a Christian, but I’m a realist so we have to do something with our overpopulation. I will defy the opinion or the belief of the Church.” Duterte said.Duterte called the bishops as hypocrites who continuously become rich in the expense of the poor. In his recent press conference, Duterte jokingly invited the reporters to join his new religion.“Alis na kayo dyan. Sama nalang kayo sa bago kong religion. May ginawa ako, Iglesia ni Duterte” said Duterte. Of course, it was a joke.The 16th President also called the church as hypocrite and ‘son of the whores’ for keep on meddling the political culture in the country.“Panahon ni Arroyo naghingian kayo That is graft and corruption, hindi niyo ba alam ‘yan? Iyung ibang tao sa Pilipinas walang makain, walang medisina, and you were enjoying the money of the goddamn people of the Philippines by riding on that. Hindi na kayo nahiya n’yan?

"THREE days after it declared the municipality of Butig in Lanao del Sur as “100 percent cleared” of terrorists, the military is still not allowing residents to go back to their respective houses as “sweeping” operations are still ongoing for booby traps, landmines and unexploded bombs, a military official said on Sunday.“We are not yet allowing civilians to return to their respective residences and we hope they would understand that because we are still continuing to clear all the unexploded ordnance including booby traps and landmines and possible IEDs [improvised explosive devices],” said Col. Edgard Arevalo, chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Public Affairs Office.He disclosed that additional K9 bomb sniffing dogs have been sent to the area to augment the military’s explosives ordnance unit and hasten the search for unexploded bombs.The military advised the residents to let the military finish its job before returning to their homes for their own safety.At present, the AFP official said military officials are talking to residents and are trying to enlist their cooperation by reporting any movements of the terrorist Maute group that occupied Butig on November 25 prompting the military to launch an all-out offensive.“Their [residents] contribution is very important because they are the ones who knew the people who should not be in the area in the first place. They are the ones who have the capability to report to the authorities if there are armed men seeking shelter. We are conducting monitoring but it would be best if we can get their cooperation,” Arevalo explained.The firefight lasted for six days that resulted in the killing of 61 Maute fighters and the wounding of 12 other jihadists.At least 35 soldiers including seven members of the Presidential Security Group were wounded.The PSG members were in Marawi City to coordinate security for President Rodrigo Duterte who was scheduled to visit the troops when they were attacked by supporters of Maute after a roadside bombing a day before the President’s visit.Arevalo said Col.

"Ifugao Representative Teddy Baguilat didn’t believe the latest result of the Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey which showed that President Rodrigo Duterte is performing better than former President Benigno Aquino III.The poll conducted on the last quarter of 2017 showed that 70% of the Filipinos believe that Duterte is better than Aquino, while eight percent only believed that the former President is better than the current leader.“History will judge him (Aquino) better I’m sure,” the member of the congress’ so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ told reporters when asked to comment on the survey.He said that there’s a big possibility that Duterte would surpass Noynoy in terms of popularity, but he believed that a high trust ratings is more important than that.“Duterte might eventually surpass PnOy’s historical average trust ratings over the course of his term. But what’s more important is not popularity but whether that high trust ratings would translate into strong legacies,” Baguilat said.“Thus, the survey results are more of an affirmation of that very high trust rating of the current administration than a fair comparison between the current n past administrations,” he added.On the other hand, Aquino still managed to achieve the highest averaging trust ratings of any President “despite several controversies in his term such as Mamasapano, PDAF and DA“PNoy achieved legacies that no popularity ratings can surpass – a vibrant and resilient economy which had rebounded from its moribund state, starting peace talks, universal Health coverage, K + 12 ), BUB , 4Ps,” he said.Baguilat is one of the fiercest critic of President Duterte and most of the policies of the current administration was opposed by the lawmaker.The other members of Magnificent seven is not yet giving comments on the latest survey conducted by SWS.",0
"The persistent popularity of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte continues to baffle the “experts”. No less than Mahar Mangahas, resident popularity survey “expert” of the Inquirer.net issued an evidently painfully convoluted “clarification” of the most recent poll which showed Duterte at a par with the likes of the presidential greats of the last 20 years (notably, former President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III was not among these greats trailing Duterte by almost 10 points).What is interesting is this bafflement is exactly the same bafflement the Opposition gnashed their teeth about a year ago in 2016 when Duterte aced the elections hands down. In short the Philippine Opposition continue to fail to understand what they are up against.The no-brainer here is that to even think of going up against a popular politician in a “democracy”, an Opposition needs to work together and unite. So the no-brainer strategic problem the Philippine Opposition faces is that they lack that credible uniting personality. This is a showstopper considering most Opposition ideologies (perhaps with the exception of the commies) are all personality-based. Indeed, the most influential and resource-rich faction of the Opposition, the Liberal Party (collectively known as the “Yellowtards” in the vernacular) are really no more than a personality cult disguised as a “modern” political party. To the average Yellowtard, the political landscape is divided on the basis of who “worships” who.Take the popular Twitter “activist” Francis B Baraan who believes that supporters of Duterte are “satanists” and, presumably, that opposition “leaders” like current “vice president” Leni Robredo are “saints”. So much for 21st Century thinking. Yet, Baraan commands close to 26,000 followers on Twitter — which says something about the way Yellowtards “think” in this day and age.From that vantage point, it is easy to see why the Opposition — led by the Yellowtards — remain baffled and unable to gain any new ground in their efforts to chisel away at the popular mandate Duterte continues to enjoy. They do not understand the enemy. They didn’t back in 2016 and they still do not (or kennat in the current Imperial Manila lingo) even today. Not knowing your enemy when you go to battle is, as most thinking Filipinos know, one of Sun Tzu’s mortal sins of warfare…If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.In the case of the Philippine Opposition, it knows neither the enemy nor itself. The fact that the Opposition lacks any consistent ideological underpinning around which to unite is evidence that it is hopelessly stuck in a crisis of both ideology and relevance. This is because it had built its relevance on a fabled Laban (“fight”) narrative that had been worn to tatters by 30 years of overuse and had built an ideology of saintly “heroes” and satanic “dictators” reminiscent of the quaint mythologies that once propped up the theocracies of ancient civilisations.There are, of course, intelligent Filipinos in the Philippine Opposition. Heck, there may even be a few of them in the Yellowtard clique itself! But considering that people like Baraan and the likes of celebrities like Jim “Look at Me” Paredes, “thought leaders” like Raissa “Tililing” Robles, and politicians like Leni “The Alleged Vice President” Robredo seem to represent the Philippine Opposition should be regarded as an absolute tragedy by true thinkers in the Philippine Opposition.The challenge for those who genuinely would like to reform the Opposition is to purge it of the clowns who infest it with medieval thinking and behave like religious zealots on social media. That’s a tall order if one considers how much the Yellowtards dominate the Philippine Opposition. It is quite obvious that Duterte won the 2016 elections on the back of a widespread public disgust for everything “yellow”. Indeed, included in the campaign paraphernalia used by the Duterte campaign machine were images of yellow colours dominating crowds of rallying Opposition “activists”. Even the relatively multi-partisan and multi-faith community of Martial Law Crybabies lament rallies that had failed because of what they perceived to be an effort hijacked by the Yellowtards.The obvious starting point to reinvigorate the Philippine Opposition and get it to a state that will make it a potent and intelligent enough force to keep the Duterte administration — and its “die hard” supporters — honest is to break out of the obsolete and circular thinking it is currently imprisoned in. To do that it will need to get to know the enemy better. Only when that understanding is achieved could the Opposition begin the journey of answering, the truly difficult questions…Why did the Liberal Party lose the 2016 elections?Why does Duterte continue to be popular?Why are Filipinos happy with the “war on drugs”?Why aren’t Filipinos concerned about Martial Law?The fact is…Religion and voodoo thinking have proven to offer no answers to these questions.As such, it is a pointless and rather primitive exercise to be using concepts such as “good” and “evil” in modern political discourse. Certainly, labelling people you don’t like as followers of “Satan” does not help. Unfortunately for the Philippine Opposition, such concepts and artefacts remain deeply-cherished relics of 1980s thinking that continue to remain ingrained in their “activist” paraphernalia.To learn from one’s mistakes, one needs to get real and face the truth. If one remains fixated in archaic beliefs and avoids evaluating evidence with a critical mind, guess what: no lessons will be learned.",0
"The Metro Manila Film Festival announced that Mocha Uson, a known supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte is the MMFF Ambassadress for this year.The appointment of Mocha gained criticisms from the Netizens, especially to the Elite who don’t like the blogger entertainer.But despite of the hate messages that she received on social media, Mocha is dedicated to do the task given to her to help the MMFF to promote its movies.For the first time, MMFF ignored the big time movie makers to give way to the Indie (Independent) Film Makers.The decision of the Metro Manila Film Festival 2016 became controversial after the movies that we traditionally watched every Christmas day didn’t make it to this year’s MMFF.The organizers are nervous that cinemas would pull out the indie entries because of it’s unpopularity to the masses.That’s why they need someone who has the influence to promote the unpopular but high quality movies in MMFF and that is Mocha Uson.It’s undeniable that Mocha Uson may greatly help the MMFF to promote its movies to the masses because most of her fans on her 4 Million Likes Facebook fan pages come from the masses.By using the influential Facebook page of Mocha, she can promote these high quality made MMFF movie entries this year for free.She has also some connection with other Facebook pages which can help her in promoting the movies on social media.Just like what happened to the movie Heneral Luna that got promoted by the Netizens on Social media, we can also do the same by promoting all the MMFF entries by the use of the internet.She can really help the MMFF, but Mocha can’t do it alone, we must help her on her task to promote the entries on social media.Forget your political beliefs and your hate for Mocha Uson, let’s try to bring back the high quality movies to the mainstream.",0
"PRIVATE hospitals blamed the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) anew for their financial problems,citing the state firm’s inability to pay the insurance claims of healthcare providers on time.In a letter President Rodrigo Duterte, Rustico Jimenez, Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines, Inc.(Phapi) president, said affected hospitals were close to declaring bankruptcy, in debt or unable to sustain their operating expenses because PhilHealth has been late in paying the hospitals’ insurance claims.This was in spite of their continuing dialogue with PhilHealth and two Senate hearings on May 22 and 28, Jimenez said.“If the situation is not immediately addressed, private hospitals will be compelled to either stand down in their operation resulting to mass layouts, or bill the patients out of their pocket,” he added.Jimenez claimed that many patients entitled to PhilHealth benefits remained unattended because of this “anomalous” situation, which “defeats the purpose of universal healthcare coverage.”",1
"As the nation marks the eighth year since the Maguindanao massacre on Thursday, the Supreme Court said decisions may be handed down separately for each of the more than 100 accused of murdering 58 people who were killed in the carnage.Of nearly 200 accused, only 115 had been arrested, including the alleged mastermind, former Maguindanao Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., who died two years ago of a heart attack.The Public Information Office (PIO) of the Supreme Court said the prosecution had completed presenting its evidence against all the principal suspects, except Andal Ampatuan Jr., whose bail petition was denied by the trial court.The Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 221 trying the case said there was strong evidence against him.It was now the turn of the accused to present their “evidence in chief” and only 103 of the original respondents remain on trial, the PIO said.“As soon as the accused have rested their presentation of evidence, their respective cases may already be submitted for the decision of the court,” it added.The RTC could hand down verdicts on each of the accused without waiting for other respondents to complete the presentation of their own evidence, it said.The court presided by Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes has heard 166 prosecution and 107 defense witnesses.On Nov. 23, 2009, armed followers of the Ampatuan clan allegedly gunned down 58 people, including 32 media workers, on a hilltop in Ampatuan town in the worst election violence in the country and the bloodiest attack against the press in the world.",1
"Noting the latest Pulse Asia survey, which showed increases in President Aquino’s trust and approval ratings for the last quarter of 2015 at 53 percent and 55 percent, respectively, Malacañang Wednesday said it was “greatly humbled by the show of support and trust by our citizens.”That is, even as the Aquino administration continues to “serve with greater passion and determination to deliver on vital social reform and development programs in the remaining months” of the President’s term, said Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr.In a statement, Coloma noted that “the greatest increases in the trust and approval ratings of the President came from the Class E at +10 and +8, respectively, which indicates a growing support for the government’s programs and initiatives that benefit the poor and marginalized sectors of our society.”On the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) poll on self-rated hunger and food poverty, Coloma said it “validates the efficacy of the government’s purposive and targeted social protection and poverty alleviation programs, anchored on the expanded Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), which have benefited close to 4.4 million households nationwide.”“In the remaining months of the Aquino administration, the government is committed to sustaining the momentum of its social protection and welfare programs through the delivery of basic education, skills training and universal healthcare that seeks to bring about the inclusion of all marginalized citizens in the mainstream of social opportunity,” he added.For his part, presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said the SWS survey results indicated that “50 percent of families consider themselves poor, bringing the yearly average to 50 percent.”“This is 4 points below the 2014 average of 54 percent and is also the lowest annual average for self-rated poverty since 2011,” he said.The survey “also reveals that 33 percent of families consider themselves food-poor, a 2-point drop compared to last September’s 35 percent and the lowest quarterly rate since March 2010.”“In addition, at 35 percent, the 2015 average for self-rated food poverty serves as a new record low for this series in terms of annual averages,” he observed.Citing the SWS report, Lacierda said “these results are underpinned by sharp quarterly declines in Mindanao.”“Both poverty and food poverty dropped significantly in the region, falling by 19 and 13 points, respectively. From 70 percent in September 2015, self-rated poverty in Mindanao plummeted to 51 percent last December, while self-rated food poverty dropped from 54 percent to 41 percent during the same period,” he also said.According to Lacierda, “these latest results from the SWS encourage us in the administration to further maximize the country’s resources toward greater inclusivity. Our 2016 budget attests to this commitment.”He pointed out the education department “will again have the largest share and funding support will continue for the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. Its benefits are clear with initial studies by the Department of Social Welfare and Development indicating that already 1.5 million households—or about 7.5 million Filipinos—have been lifted above the poverty line through the CCT.”In the coming months, Lacierda said government agencies “will remain hard at work promoting countrywide development and implementing programs that will truly benefit the people.”",1

"The House of Representatives will start its probe of the controversial 2003 Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) between the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) and the Tagum Agricultural Development Co. (Tadeco) on May 9, a lawmaker said on Thursday.Rep. Ariel Casilao of Anakpawis party-list the Makabayan bloc of lawmakers, of which he is a part, had filed a House resolution that seeks distribution of 5,202 hectares of land leased by Tadeco to agrarian reform beneficiaries.Agrarian Reform Secretary Rafael Mariano is a former Anakpawis congressman.“While the session is in recess, we have gathered a lot of information that will be of use for the May 9 probe of the Tadeco deal. These 5,202 hectares of land should be distributed to agrarian reform beneficiaries,” Casilao told reporters.The Commission on Audit earlier released a memorandum recommending the junking of the BuCor-Tadeco deal for violating the 1987 Constitution, which states that “alienable lands of the public domain shall be limited to agricultural lands… and private corporations or associations may not hold such alienable lands of the public domain except by lease, for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years, and not to exceed one thousand hectares in area…”The land leased by Tadeco covers 5,308.36 hectares of the Davao Prison and Penal Farm (DPPF) — exceeding the 1,000-hectare limit.The DPPF has a total land area of 30,000 hectares with a prison reservation of 8,000 hectares.“We will know soon if there are other questionable transactions involving Tadeco. If there are landgrabbing incidents, and if so, these should also be distributed to the farmers. At least 30,000 farmers could potentially benefit from this land,” Casilao said.Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez of Davao del Norte earlier filed a graft complaint against his congressional colleague Antonio Floirendo over the BuCor-Tadeco deal, with Alvarez saying such joint venture pact is disadvantageous to the government.The same COA team also found out that the BuCor’s deal with Tadeco inked on December 26, 1969 was also in violation of Section 2, Article 12 of the 1935 Constitution because Tadeco was allowed to use 3,000 hectares of the DPPF lands even if the 1935 Charter states that “no private corporation or association may acquire, lease, or hold public agricultural lands in excess of 1,024 hectares.”“This Tadeco issue is not about the fight between Speaker Alvarez and Congressman Floirendo. This is about the farm workers in Carmen, Panabo and Tagum City [Davao del Norte] who stand to benefit from this land,” Casilao said.",1

Getting the other side is a must, especially for the most sensitive and critical stories. The other side must run on the first take of the story and not any day later.”Inquirer’s Editorial TeamDONT FORGET TO SHARE!RELATED POSTS:GMA News recently introduced the #HindTama project, which purportedly ""aims to put in check some of the viral hoaxes that spread on social media [ GMA ]."" However, I cannot help but wonder they needlessly limited their scope when they could have covered mainstream media itself, especially those cases when mainstream media men engage in unethical practices,I am not sure of GMA knows how to do this, so let me teach them how.In “ An Analysis of Rappler’s ‘Rodrigo Duterte’s 386 P. Guevarra Property ”, I showed how failing to get the other side of the story results in cataclysmic levels of misinformation. In this article, I explained how the sorority blog Rappler came up with a conspiracy theory based solely on a document from an unidentified source, when it could’ve easily been counter-checked with a simple phone call to the Duterte camp. But that’s Rappler: my expectations are not very high.But I did not expect the three-decade-old Philippine Daily Inquirer to do the same thing.On 25 October 2016, the Inquirer’s Nikko Dizon published the controversial article “Chinese company banned by World Bank bags PH infrastructure project [ Inq ]”, where it accused the government of two things:The article, at face value, is pretty damning for the Duterte-led National Government. Why would someone who won on an anti-corruption platform award contracts to companies with dubious reputations and in contravention with procurement laws?But there’s a catch: the Inquirer did not contact the government before they published this article. That is, the Inquirer did not bother to ask anyone from the government about this prior to the article’s publication. This is confusing for regular Filipinos like me, considering that they have correspondents in the Malacañang Press Corps.The Inquirer even has direct access to Presidential Communication Operations Office Secretary Martin Andanar, who writes a column for them.That’s really odd.As it turns out, the article fell flat on its face after the government commented about the issues.Two days later on 27 October 2016, Inquirer’s Dizon published a follow-up article entitled “Just memos, contract, with Chinese firm, says BCDA [ Inq ]”, where BCDA said the documents signed in Beijing were just MoU’s, or Memorandums of Understanding between the Chinese Companies and their Philippine counterparts.BCDA Chief Vince Dizon (no relation to the Inquirer reporter) even castigated the Inquirer for neglecting to counter-check its October 25 story. He also said that MoUs are by no means an award of contract.According to the The Law Society of Singapore, “an MoU is generally considered ‘an agreement to agree’ or an agreement to enter into a more specific and comprehensive contract or agreement at a later time after further negotiations”. Furthermore, “MOUs are expressed to be not contractually binding. This is because the courts will generally not recognize agreements to enter into contracts, as contracts in their own right [ LSSG ]”.In short, MoU do not violate procurement laws because they simply are generic agreements to cooperate. MoU’s do not set up the specific terms of a project contract (e.g. specific project cost), terms that are necessary for the government to award project contract.Nikko Dizon’s article would have had a drastically less accusatory tone had the reporter bothered to ask the government about it... but she didn’t.The BCDA chief threw a sarcasm bomb at Nikko Dizon when the former said he admired the “diligence of the Philippine Daily Inquirer” then suggested that “the same diligence should have been exercised in simply reading the MOU that was signed.”Fair enough, I think. But then, if Nikko Dizon was so good at research, why did she miss reading the actual MoU’s? Surely, an organization as well-funded as hers should be able to get hold of such.It appears that her secret may be Facebook.On 23 October 2016 or two days prior to Dizon’s first article, a certain “Luis Abad” published three consecutive publicly-visible Facebook status posts [ FB1 FB3 ] that listed issues regarding the Chinese companies involved in the $24 billion worth of investment pledges that the Duterte Government helped snag in its recent State Visit to Beijing China.Starting with the statement “And the wheeling and dealing begins? The China List raises more concerns,” Abad asked several rhetorical questions that can be summed up into the following points:This is pretty long list. But to sum it all up, Abad’s questions revolve around two things: (1) regulatory compliance on the bidding process and (2) dubious company reputations.This sounds awfully similar to the Dizons’s article, which revolves around the same two core issues.Nikko Dizon’s failure to ask for BCDA’s position might be a classic case of journalistic incompetence, i.e. it was an honest accident. However, Dizon is an experienced reporter who must be very aware of allegations of bias against the Inquirer so she should’ve taken every step to dispel that notion.But she didn’t.Was the issue an accident, or is Nikko Dizon biased herself? A closer look at the Inquirer’s article’s content shows that it raised EVERY point that Abad raised. Let’s list down items in the October 25 Inquirer article that correspond to the Abad’s seven points:CAMC engineering was the only company mentioned in the Inquirer article that did not appear in any of Abad’s three posts.Such a detailed Inquirer article could not have matched those posts by pure coincidence.I am not accusing Dizon of plagiarism but I am confused as to why Dizon would pick up such leads without counter-checking when her likely source is a Liberal Party Stalwart.But there’s something more confusing here: The Philippine Daily Inquirer is a member of the Philippine Press Institute, whose Code of Ethics states [ PPI ]:So why didn’t the Inquirer’s Dizon get the other side? Is she a Liberal Party loyalist herself?Truth be told, I am disturbed about how such a story can get past the lower-tier Inquirer editors, but I am not surprised that it got past Inquirer.net Editor-in-Chief John Nery [ Nery ].Why? Because Nery appears to have actively defended Senator Leila de Lima of the Liberal Party [ LATimes ], and because he allowed the creation, publication, and the continuous expansion of the journalistic travesty that is the Inquirer’s “Kill List”[ TP: Kill List ].The PPI’s Code of Ethics also advises against conflicts of interests, which “ occur when individuals face competing loyalties: to a source or to their own self-interest, or to their organization’s economic needs, as opposed to the information needs of the public [ PPI ].”I think the conflict of interest here is economic in nature, as the Inquirer’s owners have a score to settle with President Duterte., Benjamin Philip Romualdez, husband of Inquirer heiress Sandy Prieto [ TV5 ], is the president of the Chamber of Mines [ CoM ], and we all know Duterte’s crackdown on illegal mining operators [ Inq ]., Dennis Valdes, husband of another Inquirer heiress Tessa Prieto [ Pep ], was the president of PhilWeb when Duterte’s refusal to renew Philweb’s contract resulted into its closure [ Star ].Yes, we are talking about billions of pesos' worth of potential (or realized) economic losses for the Rufino-Prietos as a result of Duterte's pro-people policies.Conflicts of interest: this is what GMA News can call #HindiTama.

"Over strong moves to recuse himself from the case of Kang Tae Sik, a South Korean businessman who was ordered arrested and deported by Justice Vitaliano Aguirre 2nd, Court of Appeals Justice Apolinario Bruselas instead ordered Kang’s former lawyer, Alex Tan, to file a comment on a motion for inhibition.Redentor Viaje, Kang’s lawyer, assailed the order to deport Kang, whom he said had been doing business in the country for 38 years.Kang was arrested and detained by Immigration agents last month on orders of Aguirre.The motion for inhibition was filed by the businessman after Brusuelas refused to act on the prayer for issuance of TRO (temporary restraining order) against Aguirre.Under the 1999 CA Rules, if the petition includes a prayer for issuance of TRO, it should immediately be ruled upon.The imminent arrest of Kang was announced by Aguirre during a Senate hearing last February 23 this year on the brutal kidnap-slay of South Korean businessman Jee Ick Joo.Viaje said Bruselas is one of the five aspirants for associate justice of the Supreme Court nominated by the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) wherein Aguirre, one of the respondents in Kang’s petition, is a member.Final selection of the SC nominees shall be made by Malacañang.To remove any suspicion of “fear and favor,” Viaje said, Bruselas should inhibit himself, considering that his appointment to the SC is literally at the mercy of Duterte administration officials who are the respondents in the case, and that the case before him is like the sword of Damocles hanging over his head.The case was reraffled to Buzuelas on April 3, 2017 after Justice Elihu Ybanez inhibited himself on ground that Tan was his classmate in San Beda College.Viaje said they have learned that Tan, Ybanez, Aguirre and Justice Undersecretary Ricardo Paras were classmates in San Beda College.Kang’s petition for the TRO was filed on March 27, 2017.In his petition, he asked the CA to stop the DOJ and Bureau of Immigration from implementing the deportation order against him and the dissolution of the warrant of deportation because both emanated from a void resolution.On March 7, 2017, Aguirre in a resolution, reversed the decision of the DoJ dismissing the deportation complaint filed against Kang.Kang was also arrested and ordered deported in October 2015 when Sen. Leila de Lima was the Justice secretary.Tan filed the deportation case against Kang when the latter refused to relinquish his import business or pay P50 million “peace offering” to a Korean-Filipino group that wanted to take over Kang’s wine import business.The deportation order against Kang was reversed by then-Justice Secretary Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa.The Immigration bureau did not file a motion for reconsideration, thus rendering Caguioa’s decision final and executory.But Aguirre revived the case and gave due course to the motion for reconsideration of Tan.He told a Senate hearing that a certain Kang Tae Sik is the head of a Korean mafia.Viaje said his client was implicated in Jee’s kidnap-slay to get rid of him.",1

"Turkey on Sunday began voting in a referendum on expanding the powers of the head of state under President Tayyip Erdogan that will determine its future political destiny but whose outcome remains in doubt after a bitterly-contested campaign.Over 55.3 million Turks are able to vote in the referendum on sweeping changes to the president’s role which, if agreed, would grant Erdogan more power than any leader of Turkey since its founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and his successor Ismet Inonu.Polling stations opened in Diyarbakir and other cities of eastern Turkey at 0400 GMT, an AFP correspondent said, with voting in Istanbul, Ankara and other cities getting underway an hour later.Opinion polls, always treated with caution in Turkey, predicted wildly divergent scenarios with analysts saying the outcome remains too close to call despite the clear advantage in resources and airtime enjoyed by the ‘Yes’ campaign.As the rival sides held rallies up until the last hour of legal campaigning Saturday to sway undecided voters, Erdogan confidently predicted that the ‘Yes’ camp had victory in the bag.But he urged people not to succumb to ”lethargy” in voting, saying ”the stronger result the better”.”A ‘Yes’ that emerges from the ballot box with the highest margin will be a lesson to the West,” he said in the Istanbul district of Sariyer, the last of a stamina-busting sequence of rallies.",1
"Polish rescue workers on Sunday found the body of 38-year-old coal miner, the first fatality after an earthquake hit a coal mine in southern Poland.Three other miners have been missing some 900 meters (2,950 feet) below ground since Saturday morning at the mine in the town of Jastrzebie-Zdroj, close to Poland’s border with the Czech Republic. One of them has been located but was not rescued yet, a mining official said Sunday.The head of the Jastrzebie Coal Company, Daniel Ozon, said the latest miner pulled out of the Zofiowka mine was pronounced dead after he had been trapped under some metal. He had worked for the company for 10 years.More than 200 workers were involved in the rescue operation. Ozon said emergency workers were pumping air into the affected area to lower the level of methane gas before they can safely move ahead.After the quake hit, four miners were rescued quickly but seven others went missing. Two of the missing were later found alive and have been hospitalized.Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who came to Jastrzebie Zdroj on Saturday night, visited the hospitalized miners and met with their families. President Andrzej Duda was on his way to the town.Authorities have launched an investigation into the accident.Poland’s State Mining Authority said the temblor had a magnitude of 3.4, while the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre pegged it at 4.3. TVN24 said the quake was also felt on the surface and shook some houses.Coal mining is a major industry in Poland. Coal remains the main source of energy and heating in the country but Poland is taking some steps to shift toward renewable, cleaner sources of energy. The Main Statistical Office said some 65.8 million metric tons (58.7 million tonnes) of coal were extracted last year in Poland, some 4.8 million tons less than in 2016.Still many of Poland’s mines are dangerous, with methane gas that has led to a number of deadly explosions and cave-ins. So far this year, five miners including Sunday’s casualty have been killed at different mines, according to the State Mining Authority.In 2016, eight miners were killed in a cave-in at the Rudna mine in Polkowice and methane explosions killed five miners at the Myslowice-Wesola mine in 2014.",1
"The policeman allegedly involved in the kidnapping of a South Korean businessman has surendered to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for fear of his life.Police Officer 2 Ricky Santa Isabel went to the NBI headquarters in Manila on Sunday evening, saying he felt safer at the bureau than at Camp Crame, headquarters of the Philippine National Police in Quezon City.NBI Director Dante Gierran confirmed the presence of Santa Isabel at the bureau, saying the latter has sought protective custody.Santa Isabel is being linked to the abduction of Jee Ick Joo, an officer of the shipbuilding firm Hanjin, last October 18 in Angeles City in Pampanga province, whose wife incidentally also sought the NBI’s help lately.Despite documentation of the alleged abduction and testimonies of witnesses, the case against Santa Isabel is still up for decision of the Prosecutor’s Office of the Justice department.Hence, there is no existing warrant of arrest.Director General Ronald dela Rosa, PNP chief, has implicated Santa Isabel in the abduction.Jee’s family claimed that they gave Santa Isabel and his men P5 million cash but the victim was not released.Dela Rosa said he believes by this time that Jee is already dead.On Monday, Santa Isabel was roaming the NBI compound but he refused to be interviewed by the media.He, however, admitted that he felt safer at the bureau’s premises than at Camp Crame.Santa Isabel attended the flag-raising at the bureau and had brief exchanges with NBI officials.",1

"“OUR PEOPLE have spoken and their verdict is accepted and respected.”President Aquino, who has said that this election is a referendum on his daang matuwid, or straight path, governance, issued this statement on Tuesday through his spokesperson, Herminio Coloma Jr., as unofficial returns from Monday’s elections showed Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte was inexorably heading toward a landslide presidential mandate.“The path of good governance … is already established as all presidential candidates spoke out against corruption,” Coloma said.There was no soaring rhetoric, but plenty of tears, in the concession statements issued by Duterte’s presidential rivals.“I will not be a party pooper at this time of festive mood,” said Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, Duterte’s harshest critic.“I will step back, listen to his policy pronouncements. This time I don’t expect a stand-up comedy act but a President who will address the nation,” Trillanes said.A tailender in the vice presidential race, Trillanes threw everything but the kitchen sink against Duterte in the final days of the campaign and filed plunder charges against the mayor for his alleged unexplained wealth.Roxas concedesIn a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Aquino’s chosen successor, Mar Roxas, said, using the mayor’s nickname, “Digong, I wish you success.”“Your victory is the victory of our people and our country,” Roxas, who emerged second in the contest behind Duterte, said to cheers from his supporters chanting his name as though he had won.“There are many tears in the room. Let me tell you: This is not a time for tears,” Roxas said, his voice cracking.“For our country, we have had a peaceful (and) successful transfer of power. It’s not about me … It’s about how we love our country and how we’ll do all that we can for her. She’s the only one,” he said.His wife, Korina Sanchez, stood beside Roxas as he delivered his 10-minute speech and uttered one line thanking Mr. Aquino for his support. He was presidential front-runner in the 2010 elections but gave way to Mr. Aquino and instead run as Vice President, and lost.“I read somewhere that it is not the battle or the conquest that we remember, but the soldier who stood beside us, who stayed true to us, who we treasure the most. To all of you, thank you so much. I will never forget you.”Clean conscienceSen. Grace Poe was the first to concede defeat on Monday night.In her campaign headquarters in Quezon City, Poe looked all of the grueling 90-day campaign that she went through to pursue her a dream which had eluded her adoptive father, the late movie action king Fernando Poe Jr.“I congratulate Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and I promise to cooperate in healing the country and unite with our countrymen to push for the continued progress of the country,” said Poe, who was accompanied by her American husband, Neil Llamanzares, and her son, Brian, in the hastily called press conference.“I will sleep this night with a clean conscience, calm in the knowledge that me and my supporters have done everything we could,” said Poe, a foundling allowed by the Supreme Court to run for President despite “misrepresentations” in her certificate of candidacy. She will return to the Senate to complete the rest of her six-year term.Duterte said Poe called him an hour before to congratulate him.“I have repeatedly called for respecting institutions and the democratic process. Once the process is completed, we should always respect the outcome,” Vice President Jejomar Binay said in a statement before Monday midnight.Heal divided land“We should all move toward healing and unity for our divided land,” said Binay, who ended up in fourth place.He stayed home after casting his ballot, appearing only in the public after her daughter, Abigail Binay, claimed victory in the Makati mayoralty race before dawn on Tuesday, continuing the decadeslong Binay dynasty in the country’s premier city.Binay held a closed-door meeting with his supporters at New Horizons Hotel in Mandaluyong City on Monday night, where he met with his APO fraternity brothers at the vanguard of his political campaign.He was the first to announce his quest for the presidency and paid dearly with a yearlong bashing in the Senate led by Trillanes for his alleged unexplained wealth.No ‘Plan B’Coloma said Mr. Aquino watched on TV at the presidential security room the election results coming in Monday night “with equanimity and objectivity.”Mr. Aquino was silent while Duterte discussed the treason complaint the mayor had filed against the President and Trillanes for allegedly losing in backdoor talks with China the Scarborough Shoal. Chinese gunboats have prevented poor Filipino fishermen from their traditional fishing waters.In a press briefing, Coloma said that the administration was “ready and willing” to work with Duterte. “Our people have spoken and their verdict is accepted and respected,” Coloma said.Coloma dismissed as “irresponsible” allegations that the Aquino administration was already gearing up for a “Plan B” to have Duterte impeached so that Rep. Leni Robredo, who is leading in the tight vice presidential race, would be installed as President. With reports from Leila B. Salaverria, Marlon Ramos, Nikko Dizon, Gil C. Cabacungan, Christine O.

"It is the proverbial 3 a.m. call that only heads of state are expected to make to settle urgent world issues. That’s exactly what happend at 3 a.m. this morning, Philippine Time (3 p.m. Washington time).U.S. President Donald Trump called Rodrigo Duterte to offer his unequivocal support for the Philippine President after the latter was widely criticized for kissing a Filipina lady on the lips during a meeting with the Filipino community in South Korea.”Don’t your critics have better things to do,” Trump reportedly told Duterte. “I fully understand your predicament. It happened to me during my campaign when an audio tape was leaked to the news media where I had commented that I grab women “by the p*ssy,” “I can definitely relate,” Trump added.Trump said he was 100% behind Duterte, chastising the news media for not having any idea on what Presidents go through every day. “They like to make a mountain out of a molehill.

"Even De Lima was harassed or not, Senator Ping Lacson believes that the former Department of Justice Secretary should still answer all the allegation against her and face the house probe to defend herself.“Pang-harass man o hindi ang pinakaimportante masagot niya. Napakahirap i-ignore ang lumabas na testigo sa HOR kasi may pagkakatugma,” Lacson said in an interview on DIWZ radio Saturday, September 24.Lacson was referring to the recent Congressional Investigation on proliferation of Illegal drugs inside the National Bilibid Prison where VIP inmates who volunteered to become a witness pointed De Lima as their protector.Even some of the witnesses are convicted criminals, Lacson said that there is also two NBI who testified against the former DOJ Sec and they claimed that they delivered drug money to De Lima.Lacson said that De Lima must face the investigation and answer all the questions of the congress even she felt harassed.“Maraming issue na di mo pwede basta i-dismiss. Hina-harass na kung hina-harass, pero kung may ebidensya at may basehan ang ginagawang sabihin nating pagha-harass kailangan talaga masagot,” He addedDe Lima said that she or her lawyer would not attend the congressional inquiry because she believes that the only goal of the congress is to destroy her image.",0
"Cebu businessman Peter Lim on Monday night denied he knew Kerwin Espinosa and blasted the confessed narcotics kingpin for dragging his name into the illegal drug trade in the Visayas.In an interview with the Inquirer, Lim denied involvement in the drug trade and said President Duterte and Philippine National Police Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa were deceived by Espinosa.“How could we believe a criminal, someone who is into illegal drugs? We can’t believe what Kerwin is saying,” Lim said.“I think [the] PNP chief was misled by Kerwin and his bodyguards. And I think President Duterte was also misinformed and misled,” he added.Lim denied he was the drug lord Peter Lim and urgedthe authorities to investigate deeper and find the real narcotics dealer.Who’s the real Peter Lim?“Somebody is behind all these lies. I think Kerwin is protecting some people, including the real Peter Lim,” Lim said.Asked who he thought was behind the disinformation, Lim said: “It might be the real Peter Lim, who is a Chinese national, who comes in and out of the country as earlier mentioned by the President.”Lim, 71, said he began to fear for his life after Dela Rosa told a Senate inquiry on Monday that Mr. Duterte had ordered the PNP to build up a case against him and to kill him if he resisted arrest.Lim met with Mr. Duterte in Davao City in July, days afterthe President publicly identified him as one of the three biggest drug dealers in the country.The other two were identified as Wu Tuan, alias Peter Co, and Herbert Colanggo, alias Ampang.Dela Rosa: He’s the oneThe Peter Lim identified by Mr. Duterte used the alias Jaguar, but Justice SecretaryVitaliano Aguirre II later clarified that he was not the same Jaguar who was killed in a gunfight with police in Parañaque City on June 18. That Jaguar was the drug dealer Jeffrey Diaz, Aguirre said.The Peter Lim identified by Mr. Duterte operated in the Visayas.During the Senate hearing on Monday, Dela Rosa said he informed Mr. Duterte that the real Peter Lim was the Cebu businessman referred to by Espinosa.“Peter Lim was among Kerwin’s suppliers of illegal drugs. and together with his driver or hit man, they reportedly met in Thailand together with Kerwin and Peter Lim,” Dela Rosa said.“Right away, I reported to the President. I told him, ‘Sir, the Peter Lim, your compadre who had a photo with you, is the same person now accused as one of Kerwin’s suppliers of illegal drugs. Right away, the President said, ‘Work on it. If he resists arrest, kill him,’” he said.The PNP chief said he was not supposed to disclose the President’s instructions, but he was compelled to do so after Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV showed a picture of Mr. Duterte and Lim standing as cosponsors at a wedding in Cebu.“I must say that the President is very angry with that Peter Lim. He is not protecting that person,” Dela Rosa said.“That picture was taken during a wedding and the President didn’t know the background of that person,” he added.In the interview with the Inquirer, Lim confirmed that he met Mr. Duterte at a wedding in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu province, and that was all.“Everybody wants to have a picture with the President. What’s wrong with me having a picture with him? I think I am sued by other people to destroy or discredit the President. That’s unfortunate,” Lim said.He said he was excited about Espinosa’s appearance at the Senate hearing, expecting the drug dealer’s testimony to clear up everything for him.But he was dismayed when the confessed drug kingpin identified him as one of his suppliers.Lim said the real Peter Lim could be the Jaguar that Aguirre referred to in September.NBI findingBut Aguirre said on Tuesday that the National Bureau of Investigation had determined that the Cebu businessman was indeed the drug lord Peter Lim.Lim urged the authorities to check his travel records, denying that he had met with Espinosa in Thailand.“Why not check our travel records, including that of Kerwin, his bodyguard and mine? Very simple. As simple as that. Then they will know that Kerwin is lying,” he said.",1

"There will never be a peaceful senate hearing when the primary suspect of the case is part of the senate.

"Liberal Party (LP) candidates will bear the brunt of public outrage over President Benigno Aquino III’s veto of the proposed P2,000 increase for pensioners of the state-run Social Security System (SSS), vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo admitted on Friday.“It’s true that administration candidates will suffer because we are the ones to take the hit,” the Camarines Sur representative told reporters in Bicol.But Robredo said she thought the President did the right thing in spite of how unpopular his decision might prove to be.“The easiest thing for him to do was to approve [the bill], because… he would look good, the Liberal Party would look good,” said the widow of Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo.She added, however, that she still needed to study Aquino’s veto message to understand it better. “For me, [the increase] will do plenty of good, but if it’s true that [SSS] will go bankrupt in 11 years, then we need to think it through.”In Malolos, Bulacan, President Aquino said he was standing by his veto of the proposed pension hike, saying he would rather be called “heartless” today than “heartless and careless” a decade from now.Heartless today“I believe that as the father of the nation, I have to plan for future needs and not respond only to what is needed at present. So I am ‘heartless’ today,” Mr. Aquino said.“(But) if in 2027, (the SSS) goes bankrupt, (then) the more than 30 million pensioners would say I am careless and heartless at the same time. That I did not think of them, that I made sure the state would not be able to deliver its promise to them,” the President told reporters in a news conference.READ: Aquino on pension hike veto: Better to be heartless now than careless laterIn his veto message on Thursday, Mr. Aquino said the SSS pension bill approved last month by Congress would compromise the viability of the agency, which would be forced to make a yearly payout of P56 billion.“Compared against an annual investment income of P30 billion to P40 billion, such total payment for pensioners will yield a deficit of P16 billion to P26 billion annually,” said Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr.The Chief Executive said he was given a choice: “I could try to look good and help (in) the endorsement (of administration candidates) and maybe by 2027, I would be forgotten and won’t be blamed (for the SSS bankruptcy). The one who would take the blame would be the one governing us by that time. But is that right, for me to bring the people towards their own misery?” he asked.President Aquino cited the government’s “social nets,” including the services provided by the Department of Health and PhilHealth, as benefits that pensioners could avail themselves of.Mr. Aquino admitted that he was aware his veto could be exploited by the opposition and that he risked making an unpopular decision in the run up to the election campaign that begins on Feb. 9.Fat bonusesThe President also defended the fat bonuses received by SSS officials, saying that the granting of bonuses went through “a long process” implemented by the Governance Commission for Government-Controlled or -Owned Corporations (GCG).While LP standard-bearer Mar Roxas “understands the reason for the veto, he also wants to find an alternative to the P2,000 across-the-board increase,” said Akbayan Rep. Barry Gutierrez, the spokesperson of the LP-led coalition.“A middle ground between the immediate benefit to current pensioners and ensuring the stability of the fund for current contributors should be found,” Gutierrez said.LP spokesperson Edgar Erice meanwhile praised Mr. Aquino for refusing to make a politically expedient decision and “not thinking about elections but what is good for our country.”He added: “We cannot spend money that we do not have. It’s just like selling your product at a very low price that in the end your store will go bankrupt.”Temporary backlashMarikina Rep. Miro Quimbo, chair of the House of Representatives ways and means committee, said the backlash against President Aquino’s unpopular decision “will be temporary.”Being part of the LP coalition, he said, was “both an advantage and a responsibility. ‘Daang matuwid’ means doing the right thing, popular or otherwise. That’s precisely why the President has the highest approval rating for an outgoing President in our history.”The Marikina representative also proposed another compromise to the vetoed pension hike, and said that SSS pensioners could be given an increase based on their contributions.“It is unfair that practically the same increase will be given to a retiree who has contributed for 10 years and another who has contributed for 30 years,” said Quimbo.In Pozorrubio, Pangasinan, Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares, principal author of the proposed hike, has started a congressional campaign to overturn President Aquino’s veto of the proposed hike in pension funds, even as presidential aspirant Sen. Grace Poe expressed her support for the override.“I have the inclination to [support the] override because as [Colmenares] says, there is a source for the fund. There is only a need to [achieve] effective collection [of membership obligations],” Poe said during a news conference here after attending the annual Talong Festival in Villasis town.Full accountingSen. Francis Escudero, Poe’s running mate, said he would also work to overturn Mr. Aquino’s veto. “I understand where the President is coming from, but we also have a job to do as lawmakers,” Poe’s running mate said.Colmenares, who joined Poe’s group, said it was incumbent on him to sponsor the override bill because he authored the pension increase bill in the House.Senatorial candidate and Leyte Rep. Ferdinand Martin Romualdez meanwhile demanded a full accounting of SSS funds and collectibles to validate government claims that it could not afford to grant the proposed P2,000 increase.Romualdez cited reports that the SSS failed to collect P13 billion from delinquent employers as of 2014, while aging member loans had reached P64.01 billion, of which P19.407 billion had been outstanding for more than 5 years.The congressman also noted that out of 164,111 delinquent employers in 2010 alone, the SSS had filed only an average of 1,200 cases per year.“Divide that and the difference will show that more than 100 years shall have passed before the SSS collects from these delinquents. This is assuming that some of them would still be alive by then and their businesses are still open,” he said. ",1
"To literally give the public a taste of real strawberry wine, as against synthetically flavored drinks, the town of La, Trinidad in upland Benguet province held a “Strawberry Wine Fair” on Tuesday.The event was also aimed at promoting the town’s main product–strawberry–being the country’s largest producer of strawberries.“One of the new features of the strawberry festival, one way of promoting the product, particularly in the production of local wine, is the conduct of this strawberry wine fair, which includes other wines produced from fruits in season during the off-strawberry season,” said Fely Ticbaan, municipal agriculture officer.Ticbaan said even if the event was specifically named “strawberry wine fair”, also served in the fair were other fruit wines like “bignay”, which is also produced by strawberry winemakers when the red berries are not in season.“We would like to showcase to our consumers that this is what strawberry fruit wine looks like, and this is the taste of one that went through the proper processing procedure. This is the color produced by local winemakers and they have their markings and quality standard marks,” the town’s official said.The strawberry wine fair charged a fee of PHP100, which entitles the ticket holder to an unlimited serving of strawberry and other fruit wines, coupled with appetizers and music from local performing bands to add to the festivities.La Trinidad Councilor Nestor Fongwan Jr., who had pushed for the activity, related that the fair was done, following the clamor from strawberry winemakers.“It was a clamor of the legitimate strawberry winemakers to have their products showcased,” Fongwan said, pointing out the winemakers wanted the public to see and taste the difference between real flavored and synthetically flavored drinks.It was the first time in the annual strawberry festival that such wine fair was held.Fongwan disclosed the town’s government is mulling a legislative measure for quality control in the production of strawberry wines and drinks, with the aid of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Food and Drugs Administration.La Trinidad Vice Mayor Joseph Vivencio Marrero said pending before the municipal council is an ordinance that requires products produced in La Trinidad to have the mark of the local government for identification purposes, which would also be a measure of quality control.“We will soon be labeling our products with the mark of La Trinidad, Benguet but we want to do it gradually to make sure that they will serve their purpose as envisioned,” Marrero said. “We are trying our best to help the entrepreneurs to have the label of the town.”La Trinidad is not only the country’s prime producer of strawberries. It also holds the world record for the “biggest strawberry shortcake”.",1
"Ethiopia’s stunning political reforms are now threatened by long-standing ethnic tensions that have roared back to life since a young prime minister took power just five months ago and promised greater freedoms.While exiled groups once banned as terror organizations are welcomed home to join political dialogue, deadly violence erupts on the fringes of celebrations. On Saturday, tens of thousands of people gathered peacefully in Addis Ababa’s Meskel Square to cheer one group’s return. Two days later, police fired tear gas there to disperse people protesting killings blamed by some on youth from the same ethnicity.Suddenly, the government of 42-year-old Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed appears to be reaching for security tactics whose unpopularity helped to bring down the previous government, while some Ethiopians who cheered Abiy’s reforms now accuse him of being soft on the unrest that poses his biggest challenge so far.The internet winked off this week across the capital, a once-common act to control dissenting voices. The National Security Council has vowed “all necessary measures” against those spreading anarchy, the state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporate reported. Some have even called for the return of the state of emergency that Abiy lifted in one of his first acts in office.The prime minister himself, who shocked the country with a dizzying series of reforms that included freeing imprisoned opposition figures and vowing free and fair elections in 2020, has made warning sounds against the unrest.“There’s nothing more shameful than a group of people committing these types of crimes against their fellow citizens,” Abiy said Tuesday while visiting a camp for those displaced by the latest violence.Stability is crucial in a country whose fast-growing economy, 100 million-strong population and security ties make it the powerhouse of the turbulent but strategic Horn of Africa region.Ethnic-based conflicts mainly over scarce resources are common in Ethiopia, which is home to more than 80 ethnic groups, but now the communal violence is spiraling at a scale that alarms many.“If this trend continues, I fear a time will come soon when Ethiopians yearn for the old dictatorial times,” Mussie Tefera, a university student, told The Associated Press.Ethiopia since 1991 has been led by a ruling coalition and allied parties that hold every seat in Parliament and for years were accused by human rights groups of suppressing critical voices. That grip on power slipped after anti-government protests that began in late 2015 in the Oromia and Amhara regions, home of the country’s two largest ethnic groups.Abiy’s arrival in power was a surprise. He is the first prime minister from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, the Oromo. As the son of a Muslim father and Orthodox Christian mother who converted to Islam he has spoken out for tolerance. On an exuberant tour of the United States that drew large crowds, he spoke to Ethiopian communities and invited emotional exiles long wary of the government to return.His appeals to peace and openness, however, have not healed long-standing ethnic fractures between groups such as the Oromo and the Somalis. Some disputes have worsened. The number of the country’s internally displaced people has reached 2.8 million, up from 1.6 million at the beginning of the year, according to the United Nations.For some, the surge in unrest comes with the recent shifts in power.“Local cadres and officials are instigating this violence for a petty political gain,” Ethiopia’s disaster prevention chief, Mitiku Kassa, told The Associated Press after fighting between the Oromo and others in the Gedeo and West Guji zones.Over the weekend, the U.S. Embassy was among those issuing safety warnings amid the violence on the outskirts of the capital as many Ethiopians expressed outrage over the alleged targeting of people based on ethnic identity. More than 20 people were killed.“We demand justice,” some protesters chanted as they passed by the prime minister’s office on Monday en route to Meskel Square. By the end of the day, mobile internet service across Addis Ababa was blocked as citizens and Amnesty International pointed out hate speech against non-Oromo groups on social media. Internet service returned on Wednesday.While some accuse “paid agents” of trying to paint a bad image of Oromo youth emboldened by Abiy’s rise to power, others suggest some unrest is being orchestrated by groups in the ruling coalition that lost power when he took office.Any internal frictions could be exposed when the ruling coalition holds its congress early next month, when it is expected to take steps to implement Abiy’s whirlwind political and economic reforms.",1
"that’s terrible. One side of it is to inspire the police, remind the police to do their work according to the books,” Valles told reporters in an interview Sunday.Valles, who will take over as CBCP president on December 1 said he saw the need to address the drug problem because “drugs also kill” in a silent way.The archbishop said the country did not realize the enormity of the drug problem until President Rodrigo R. Duterte, who served as mayor of Davao City for 22 years, assumed office last June 30, 2016.The way to address the extra-judicial killings (EJKs) is to address the problem of illegal drugs itself in the country that he described as a “complicated and a messy” problem that has destroyed many lives, he said.“I’m worried about it (killings). I will also wish to make calculations how many lives have been destroyed by drugs, how many were killed by drugs, how many families were destroyed by drugs. Those are very important questions to me,” he said.“Grabe ang drugs. Gigunitan gyud ta ba. (Drug problem is a serious one. It controls us.) I cannot emphasize it enough,” he added.Amid the escalating criticism of the alleged abuses by police in the war on drugs, President Duterte has empowered the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) to be the sole agency in charge of the anti-drug operations.In a two-page memorandum order released on October 10, the President directed the National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines, Bureau of Customs, Philippine Postal Office and all other agencies or any and all ad-hoc anti-drug task forces to leave to PDEA “the conduct of all campaigns and operations against all those who, directly or indirectly, and in whatever manner or capacity, are involved in or connected with, illegal drugs.”The President, upon arrival from his two-day working visit in Japan last October 31, acknowledged that PDEA lacks personnel to lead the anti-illegal drug operations but added he is still trying to gauge the situation if it would “improve the overall picture of law and order.”“If what they are saying is true that it can improve the overall picture of law and order without the police, let’s see. If it’s worsened, let us see. I will say let’s petition before the Commission on Human Rights what they can do,” he said.",1
" The government panel and its communist counterpart are set to sign the interim peace agreement (IPA) next month to pave the way for the resumption of formal peace talks, Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founding chair Jose Maria Sison has revealed.Sison said back-channel consultations between the peace panels of the government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) resulted in the recent approval of the IPA.The NDFP is the umbrella group of all communist-led underground organizations that has been conducting on-and-off peace talks with the government since 1986.DisagreementsIn an online interview on Saturday, Sison said the signing of the IPA was supposedly scheduled on June 28 in Oslo, Norway, with President Rodrigo Duterte sending Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea as his representative.Disagreements over the final venue — the President has insisted that the signing of the IPA be held in the Philippines — and the President’s demand for Sison to return to the Philippines, however, must be resolved first.Sison, the self-exiled NDFP’s chief consultant, said he would return to the country only if there were significant developments in the negotiations.“I have consistently declared that I will return home when substantial progress is already achieved in the GRP (Government of the Republic of the Philippines)-NDFP peace negotiations, and my comrades and lawyers are satisfied with the legal and security guarantees,” he said in a statement issued from his base in Utrecht, the Netherlands.The communist “supremo” said they listed the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, as a possible venue as it is closer to the Philippines.“Nothing is sure until there is a joint announcement [from the two panels]. Wait for the joint announcement in the second week of June,” Sison said.‘Big help’He said the signing of the IPA would contribute to the success of the peace talks and add to mutual confidence-building measures.“The IPA would be a big help. Duterte and the military would be pleased that there would be a ceasefire and the NDFP would be happy with the amnesty proclamation to free all political prisoners,” Sison said.The IPA is meant to pave the way for a formal ceasefire between the military and New People’s Army, the CPP’s armed wing.Both parties have approved the agrarian reform and rural development, and national industrialization and economic development sections of the comprehensive agreement on social and economic reforms (Caser).Personal meetingConsidered as the heart and soul of the peace process, the Caser calls for, among other solutions to the country’s social problems, free land distribution and rural industrialization.Sison, in a Facebook post on Saturday, said the NDFP had planned a personal meeting between him and the President during the signing of the agreement.Precarious situation“There are certain important considerations against my prematurely returning to the Philippines,” he said, adding that the peace talks would be placed in a precarious situation if it would be held in the country.“First, I would be going against the established mutual agreement to hold the peace negotiations in a foreign neutral venue. Second, I would be placing myself and the entire peace negotiations in the pocket of Duterte and at his mercy. Third, any peace spoiler or saboteur would be able to destroy the entire process by simply abducting or harming any NDFP panelist or consultant,” he said.Sison said the original plan mutually agreed upon by both parties during the back-channel consultations was to have the President attend the Oslo ceremony for the signing of the IPA.Alternative siteBut Malacañang rejected the idea and instead offered Medialdea as the President’s representative, according to Sison.He said the NDFP then offered Hanoi as the alternative venue but the government did not give a positive answer.“Hanoi as a venue near the Philippines was proposed by NDFP in consideration of the heavy work schedule of Duterte,” Sison said.The Norwegian government’s special envoy, he said, cannot make any arrangement with Hanoi. Norway has long served as a third-party facilitator for the peace talks.",1
"Sen. Leila de Lima who is facing three illegal drug trade complaints at the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court (RTC) would be staying longer at the police headquarters as the court has rescheduled the hearing on her motions to dismiss her cases to next month.Branch 205 Judge Amelia Fabros-Corpuz gave the prosecutors from the Department of Justice (DOJ) 10 days to comment on the senator’s motions to quash and judicial determination of probable cause.The prosecution was also ordered to reply within 10 days to the motions of Jose Adrian Dera, De Lima’s coaccused on the case, for judicial determination of probable cause and to hold the issuance of warrant of arrest.The defense, in turn, was given another 10 days to comment on the prosecution’s motion to consolidate all the cases.The next hearing has been scheduled for April 21, or after the Holy Week.According to the DOJ, Dera, a former aide of the senator, demanded millions of pesos and vehicles for De Lima’s senatorial run from convicted drug lord Peter Co.Last week, the DOJ prosecutors submitted a motion asking Judge Juanita Guerrero of the Muntinlupa RTC Branch 204 to consolidate the cases handled by Branches 205 and 206, and the case in her court into a single case that she alone would try.De Lima’s counsel previously said the defense would oppose the motion, as all three cases would be heard by Guerrero, who had ordered the senator’s arrest just three days after the justice department filed the complaint against the lawmaker.The Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday the motion of De Lima for the high court to review her case and to bar Guerrero from hearing her cases.De Lima had asked the high tribunal to order the inhibition of Guerrero from the case for prejudging it and for grave abuse of discretion in issuing the arrest warrant with “undue haste and inordinate interest.”The three cases arose from complaints brought by the National Bureau of Investigation and Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption based on testimonies during the House of Representatives’ inquiry into the alleged illegal drug trade in New Bilibid Prison during De Lima’s term as secretary of justice.",1
"The crime rate in Boracay has dipped by an astounding 89 percent, thanks to better police interventions and the fact that fewer people roam the shut-down holiday island.Amid the government’s efforts to rehabilitate the world-famous beach destination, which President Duterte has likened to a “cesspool,” the Western Visayas Command of the Philippine National Police reported a substantial decline in index crimes.Chief Supt.

"The take home pay of teachers will increase this year due to the TRAIN (Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion) Act, plus increases in their allowances, the Department of Education (DepEd) noted Friday. The TRAIN Act or Republic Act No. 10963 was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte last December to provide income tax cuts to most of the Filipino taxpayers. It is also said to be the first package of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program.The basic salary of a Teacher 1, for instance, is PHP19,620 and has a take home pay of PHP17,220.With the implementation of the TRAIN Act and also the 3rd tranche of the Salary Standardization Law of 2015, DepEd said a Teacher 1 would have a basic salary of PHP20,179. They would have a take home pay of PHP20,012 (with Personnel Economic Relief Allowance or PERA), the DepEd said. In a statement, the agency said it supports the administration’s tax reform initiative as this would “significantly develop the country’s human capital”. DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones has been working on helping teachers get an adequate compensation. Last October 26, she signed DepEd Order (DO) 55, or the “Revised Guidelines on the Implementation of PHP4,000 Net Home Pay for DepEd Personnel”.The move aims to help teachers manage their finances, after data showed that many of them avail of various loans. DO 55 prioritized deductions for contributions to the GSIS, Home Development Mutual Fund, Bureau of Internal Revenue, and PhilHealth.Meanwhile, teachers can also look forward to an increase in their allowances. Their clothing allowance, which used to be PHP5,000, would be PHP6,000 this year.Similarly, their chalk allowance (which they could use to buy chalks and other classroom supplies), would be increased from PHP2,500 to PHP3,500, DepEd said.

In the Philippines, there is also a lolo leave (grandfather leave.)Today, President Duterte took a leave of absence, his first since assuming office last July, to visit his new-born grandson.Duterte’s daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte gave birth to a baby boy on Thursday, according to a photo posted by her husband, lawyer Mans Carpio, on Instagram.Stonefish, the couple’s third child, was born at 12:56 p.m. Duterte was pregnant with triplets but lost two to miscarriage.The proud lolo was seen all smiles as he visited the nursery.It wasn’t clear whether the presidents’ leave of absence was with or without pay.Knowing the president though, that lolo leave probably lasted just a couple of hours and he is now back at work.Congratulations to the proud grandpa!",0
"The Philippines will see the launching of its first-ever satellite in April this year, Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Secretary Mario Montejo said yesterday. The schedule was set after the DOST firmed up the arrangements with an American provider of space shuttle services on which the “micro satellite” would be launched.Filipino scientists from the DOST are now in Japan, collaborating with space scientists from Hokkaido University, in the assembly of the micro satellite. Though the assembly is now getting much assistance from Japanese scientists, Montejo said the Filipinos are doing the actual design and fabrication activities.The micro satellite will be a key component of the cutting edge remote sensing technology capability being developed by the DOST, which will use satellite imagery and ground data processing to generate data and information on agricultural and also marine and mountain conditions.There is, however, one big problem.The Philippine micro satellite’s planned and designated orbit in space has already been claimed by China as part of the latter’s continuing territorial expansionist policy. China has vowed to protect and defend its space territory against any intruders, the Philippines included.It looks like the Philippines-China territorial dispute in the South China Sea has been launched into space!",0
"A Latin phrase meaning “first among equals,” Wikipedia.org cites “primus inter pares” as “typically used as an honorary title for those who are formally equal to other members of their group but are accorded unofficial respect.” It is noted that the “princeps senatus” of the Roman Senate was such a figure and initially only bore the distinction that he was allowed to speak first during the debate. “Among modern figures such as the chair of the Federal Reserve, the prime minister of parliamentary regimes, the chief justice of the United States and the ecumenical patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church bear higher status and various additional powers while remaining still merely equal to their peers in important senses.”I had the good fortune of serving in two government boards where the concept of “primus inter pares” was acknowledged and observed with excellent results for the smooth functioning of the organization. In the Board of Investments, with then DTI Secretary Jose Concepcion as chairman and Tomas Alcantara as vice-chairman and managing head, the board could always rely on both to be strong in their opinions and views but accommodating as well to the differing positions of other governors. There were instances where I deferred to them, given Joe’s long experience in business and industry but he in turn would always go my way when it came to small and medium enterprises. Both Joe and Tommy also recognized the importance of ground experience that after I related my travails riding a bus from Cauayan, Isabela, they supported my recommendation to launch the Bus Modernization Program. Joe initially was against “portalets” but when I argued that it was part of a modern waste management system he went along which allowed the pilot units to come in and help alleviate the sanitary conditions in the wake of the earthquake in Baguio. Board discussions could be lively but always in an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect.With BSP Governor Rafael Buenaventura as chairman of the Monetary Board, we worked as a team. Each Monetary Board Member was assigned a sphere of influence and we had Monday sessions where we would discuss controversial issues so that the regular Thursday board meetings would have had all kinks ironed out. I once complained to Paeng that the recorded minutes would not reflect the full breadth and scale of our deliberations. He advised me to just repeat my arguments for the record. Paeng despite his extensive experience in international and local banking was always open to the views of Nonoy Alindogan, former treasurer of Ayala Corporation, Johnny Quintos, a retired BSP deputy governor with years as a central banker, Vince Valdepenas, former economic secretary and economics professor, Teddy Valdepenas, a Citibanker and later Fe Barin, the institutional memory of BSP. All of our decisions were collegial and even if we had initial contrary opinions, once an MB decision was made we supported it. Even if at times there could be personal differences, we resolved it among ourselves as mature persons and never brought our differences to the public arena.It is with deep regret that I have been following the proceedings in Congress on the impeachment hearings of Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno and reading tidbits of “infighting” in the chambers of the Supreme Court. I wonder why the disagreements mostly on leadership and management were not settled among the justices themselves. If the rift had reached intolerable levels, could not the justices in banc have confronted the chief justice?Why did some justices have to wait for an impeachment hearing to “spill the beans” raising suspicions that they had become part of the administration allies’ move to punish the Chief Justice for her “original sin” which was defying President Rodrigo’s order for judges allegedly linked to the drug trade to step down? Did they not realize that their testimonies and actuations inthe hearings erode public respect in and credibility of the Supreme Court just as they believe the chief justice’s arbitrary actions made her lose their regard for if not respect for her? I admire Senior Justice Antonio Carpio who declined an invitation to appear in Congress and who, I believe, is in the best position to unite the Supreme Court.It is time for the Congress to dismiss the complaints. The acts being attributed to the chief justice may be lapses in management and deal more with relationships among justices; certainly not impeachable offences. Then the Supreme Court and the chief justice in their wisdom and desire to protect the institution they and we love will arrive at the right decision.",1

"PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday called on the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to rev up the fight against counterfeiting.“I call on the BSP to stop illegal activities that impede our efforts in promoting the integrity of our currency.Intensify your [programs] against counterfeiting and conduct more campaign [drives] in order to protect our citizens from confusion and deceit,” Duterte said during the presentation of new generation currency banknotes and coins in Malacañang.Duterte also ordered the central bank to be vigilant in ensuring price and financial stability by the institution of banking reforms and sharpening strategies. He commended the bank for creating stronger and safer financial systems, and for safeguarding the integrity of the Philippine peso.In February 2016, unidentified hackers stole $81 billion, or around P4.2 billion, from Bangladesh’s central bank.The money was then sent to accounts at the Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.

What intelligent, reasoning people are criticizing is the xenophobic chest thumping and self-aggrandizing being spewed as if the accident of birth that made you Filipino somehow made you superhuman and extra brave because you managed not to die or that you blamed the officials in a basketball game for not allowing your team to win. (To win at basketball you have to play as a team and learn to PASS the ball!!!)Filipinos have little to be proud of other than the exploits of 2 or 3 boxers and on occasion, some beauty contestant or singer.

"What party?Detained Sen. Bong Revilla on Monday dismissed as “baseless, malicious and outright lies” the claims of government prosecutors that he attended the birthday celebration of his fellow detained lawmaker, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, on Feb. 14 at Camp Crame.But photographs appear to tell a story different from Revilla’s version.The senator did not comment on the two photographs that the prosecution had submitted to the Sandiganbayan Fifth Division in opposing Revilla’s request to undergo medical examination.The photos, taken by a person who was also present at Enrile’s 91st birthday celebration, showed the two senators sharing a table with several others.In her Feb. 18 column “From Both Sides Now” in Manila Bulletin, Milwida Guevara, a former finance undersecretary, claimed to have seen Revilla at Enrile’s birthday celebration.“Revilla was only allowed to stay for a few minutes,” said Guevara, CEO of Synergeia Foundation and a faculty member at Ateneo de Manila University School of Government where she teaches public finance.In a statement, Revilla maintained that he was taken by the personnel of the Philippine National Police Custodial Center in the afternoon of Valentine’s Day after he experienced “cold sweats, stiffness and pain on the back [of] my head and neck.”The senator said that he also had an episode of “debilitating migraine attack” and that his blood pressure had suddenly gone up.“Reports that I was sneaked out by PNP personnel from the PNP Custodial Center are absolutely false,” Revilla said.“It is not true that I was at the hospital to visit Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile. I did not go to his room as I did not even know where that was. Reports and assertions to the contrary are baseless, malicious and outright lies,” he said.ViolationDirector Joefferson Toribio, a member of the Ombudsman prosecution panel, said Revilla’s presence at Enrile’s birthday party was a “serious violation of the court’s order.”He said the antigraft court specifically directed the PNP not to “allow the accused to be moved, removed or relocated until further orders from the court.”“We are really puzzled why he was photographed inside the room of Senator Enrile with his sons on Feb. 14,” Toribio told reporters.Revilla said he was brought to PNP General Hospital, where Enrile has been detained since June last year, after Senior Insp. Celina Tapaoan, the detention facility’s officer of the day, approved his written request.Along with fellow opposition Sen. Jinggoy Estrada, Revilla has been locked up at the police detention center since they were ordered arrested by the Sandiganbayan in June 2014 following their indictment for graft and plunder in connection with the P10-billion pork barrel scam.Enrile was placed on hospital arrest at the PNP medical facility, just a few meters away from the PNP Custodial Center in Camp Crame, the PNP’s national headquarters.Revilla said his sons, Cavite Vice Gov. Jolo Revilla and actor Bryan Revilla, were with him during his brief stay at the hospital which, according to him, lasted only about 30 minutes.He said he returned immediately to his detention room “to rest after my blood pressure [reading] was taken and was given medication.”The senator lambasted the prosecutors from the Office of the Ombudsman who “have again gone [to great] lengths to propagate lies and put me in a bad light.”“If the sudden increase in my blood pressure was not taken care of and I suffered a heart attack, what would the prosecution do?” Revilla said.

"Jealousy, obviously is the reason why she did what she did to the female fan who was taking a selfie with Nadine's boyfriend and actor James Reid. The jealousy was not really directed to the girl whose arm was roughly shoved by the actress but rather towards the other female on the right hand side of James.According to various sources i.e. the internet and other bloggers, the girl in question is non-celebrity but pretty enough to turn heads even those of the likes of young heartthrobs such as James Reid.Nadine Lustre and James Reid has been a thing for several years now so chances are that this is not the first time they encountered pretty fangirls fangirling, gawking and hovering really close over James Reid. That is why many wonder: what is suddenly wrong with Nadine? Why snapped at fans when you've been being swarmed by them this past several years? Why now?Those questions can only be answered truly by Nadine herself leaving us to only speculate until such time she choose to break her silence regarding the issue.One popular speculation among bloggers is that Nadine's jealousy has been growing recently because of the number of pretty girls she thinks prettier than her attracted to James Reid.According to our resident psychologist, Marian, this alleged feeling of jealousy had gone unchecked and had allegedly reached its boiling point when bashers online pointed out her physical flaws.More recently, Nadine had gone viral because of her rather dark skin around the crotch area. Now, we all know that Filipinos still thinks that fairer skin is the epitome of beauty, hundreds of years of colonization throughout our history made sure that we stay that way for many years up to now.In fact, the sheer amount of skin whitening products being sold everywhere in the country and being peddled by every celebrity and even no-name 'works at freelance' type of models on social media is a clear sign of our obsessions with fairer and whiter skin.That said, Nadine, whose skin tone is closer to being a morena than white, allegedly felt inferior to girls who have whiter skin. The girl to whom Nadine got jealous is a girl of whiter complexion, it was said. That girl allegedly not only broke the fangirling selfies with a male celebrity's maximum limit of only 36 shots but she also appeared to have purposely squish her buxom (albeit more sizeable than Nandine's) against James Reid's chest.All of this of course cannot be proven true or otherwise and should not be taken as such. If you can read, you will have noticed by now that we mentioned that these was just the speculations of bloggers supplemented by our resident psychologist until such time Nadine herself confirms it.Update: Darline Paranada, a model who is one of the girls in the Jadine tampal braso video has this to say:Here's a video of Nadine Lustre slapping the arm of a fan taking selfies with James Reid:",0
"a positive sign of economic progress in this city, Vice Mayor Vianca Venzon Gozon has called for the preservation of the environment.Speaking during the recent opening of the Westfields Residences, one of the housing projects Businessman Ronnie del Rosario, president of Cresta de Oro Phil., Inc., Gozon appealed to property developers to involve the communities in preserving, protecting and maintaining a clean environment in the city.Citing the acute need for housing, Gozon lauded Del Rosario for contributing to the solution in the shortage in housing in Bataan.Westfields Residences is located on the provincial road in Barangay Tuyo, a strategic location near the heart of the city which is just a walk away from two landmark fastfood chain branches here, the four-lane highway, and the Central Terminal.Since its conversion into a component city, Balanga has become progressive with the sprouting of commercial establishments, access roads, big number of employment and the prevailing peace and order.

"President Duterte made an unannounced visit to the headquarters of the 2nd Mechanized Brigade (MB) in Barangay Maria Cristina here on Friday, Malacañang said.The surprise visit came amid reports he was going to Marawi City where 85 soldiers had already been killed in the clashes between the military and the Maute group.The Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) confirmed that Mr. Duterte was supposed to visit Marawi, some portions of which were still occupied by Maute terrorists, but the trip was canceled.“The President was supposed to go to Marawi City … but decided not to push through because of inclement weather,” the PCOO said in a statement.Dressed in combat fatigues, Mr. Duterte was accompanied by Special Assistant to the President Christopher Lawrence Go and his close-in security.During his visit to the 2MB, Duterte again assured soldiers of his unwavering support to troops battling the Maute group.It was the third time Duterte visited Iligan since the Marawi crisis started on May 23.",1
"BUREAU of Customs (BoC) Commissioner Isidro Lapeña has ordered the conversion of the controversial Command Center (ComCen) of the agency into the Operations Center (OpCen) that would track in real time all customs ports around the country but without the authority to issue alert orders on flagged shipments.Lapeña issued the order over the weekend that followed his earlier directive disbanding the ComCen, which he said was not only illegal but also ineffective where the issuance of alert orders was concerned.“ComCen has a lot of computers and monitors, among other equipment. It will be used by the OpCen to monitor the activities in our ports around the country in real time,” he said.OpCen’s function would be similar to that of the Philippine National Police operations center, according to Lapeña, a retired police general prior to his earlier appointment as chief of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and now as Customs commissioner.The ComCen was a superbody created by then-BoC chief Nicanor Faeldon through Customs Special Order (CSO) 45-2016.It was vested with a centralized power to monitor the bureau’s entire operations and the only unit vested with the authority to issue alert orders.Lapeña issued Customs Memorandum Order (CMO) No.14-2017, which delegated back the power to issue alert orders to the deputy commissioner for intelligence (IG), deputy commissioner for enforcement (EG) and all district collectors for shipments arriving within their district and sub-ports.He explained that when an alert order is issued, appraisal and examination is conducted at the collectors’ level and the one who issued it is supposed to do that but which ComCen could not do because it had no one to send to ports outside the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Port.“Without a personnel, it can’t be properly implemented. That is why I immediately directed the issuance of a Customs memorandum order to abolish ComCen and giving authority to the deputy commissioners,’ Lapeña said.All other powers and functions of the ComCen under CSO 45-2016 will be exercised and performed by the corresponding offices and officials pursuant to the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA) and Executive Order 127, Series of 1987.Lapeña said grounds for the issuance of alert orders and other provisions of the CMTA and other pertinent laws shall be strictly observed.He also requires all Customs officers who issue alert orders to submit to the office of the commissioners a summary of all alert orders issued within 24 hours upon issuance, a summary of all examined alerted shipments within 24 hours upon completion of examination and summary of shipments examined within 48 hours from the time the consignee or broker was notified of the alert order.“In cases where physical examinations of alerted shipments were not conducted within 48 hours from issuance of the alert order, the status report should also indicate the reason for the delay in [such examinations],” Lapeña said.",1
"The Department of Tourism (DOT) is urging the Bureau of Immigration (BI) to hasten the processing of visas upon arrival (VUAs) of foreign visitors in a bid to increase tourist arrivals.Benito Bengzon Jr., tourism undersecretary and spokesperson, said at a meeting of hoteliers in Makati on Thursday that the DOT was looking at increasing arrivals from China and India.“Right now, two major markets that we have to really look out in terms of facilitating entry are China and India,” Bengzon said.Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat also said in Tokyo that the DOT also wanted an increase in the number of tourists from Japan.“As we face the next half of 2018, we look forward with excitement to hitting a new high in Japanese tourism arrivals by breaching the 600,000 mark,” Puyat said on Thursday.Japan marketPuyat said Japan sent a total of 584,180 visitors to the country last year and has remained the fourth top tourism market with a 9.14 percent increase from 2016’s arrivals of 535,238.South Korea remained the No. 1 source of foreign tourists at 1.6 million, or a market share of 24.28 percent, but China dislodged United States as the second top market with 968,447 tourists, or 14.63 percent of total inbound tourist traffic in 2017.Arrival of Chinese tourists grew 43.81 percent to 559,289 from January to May, compared to the same period last year.India was 12th in the tourism tally with 107,278 arrivals in 2017, but the government sees it as a viable market.Indian marketOnly Indian passport holders with valid visas to the European Union, United States, Australia, Japan and Singapore are granted VUAs in the Philippines.In August last year, the BI started issuing VUAs to Chinese nationals “to attract more tourists and investors from China.”Also called “landing visas,” VUAs are given upon a foreigner’s arrival.The program to attract more tourists by easing visa processes comes in the wake of the controversy over moves to deport foreign missionaries accused by the Duterte administration of interference in domestic affairs.",1
"A Pasig City court has denied an injunction request against the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) filed by Global Mobile Online Corporation (Global Tech) in connection with its controversial operation of the “Peryahanng Bayan,” a court document showed.The order, according to a statement, was penned on October 13, 2017, by Nicanor Manalo Jr., presiding judge of Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 161.“All told, the motion for issuance of writ of injunction is denied for lack of merit and the parties are directed upon receipt of order to arbitrate pursuant to the Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution,” Manalo said.“Going into the merits of the instant case, it appears that the court has already issued an order partially granting PCSO’s motion for reconsideration and directing the parties to submit the issue for arbitration only after Global Tech’s posting of a surety bond. With the said directive and posting of the bond, the parties could now proceed to arbitration,” he added.When asked to comment, PCSO General Manager Alexander Balutan and Chairman Jose Jorge Corpuz confirmed the court order but did not issue any more details in deference to the next legal moves by both sides.PCSO officials welcomed the court order.They also confirmed that the agency still has a pending petition before the Court of Appeals (CA).The PCSO filed a petition for certiorari with an application for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction before the CA last July precisely to contest the need for arbitration when Globaltech had already profited at the expense of the people.Globaltech started its operations all over the country in 2014 on the strength of a deed of authority (DoA) from the PCSO that was meant to be a “test run” of an envisioned cooperation that should have helped the PCSO increase its revenue.Globaltech, however, failed to comply with the terms of the DoA and the PCSO eventually terminated the DoA in March 2016.It filed a civil case to stop the PCSO from proceeding with the termination of the DoA and forced the agency to an arbitration.But the DoA had already been terminated and the PCSO insisted against arbitration.Aside from being a violation of anti-illegal gambling laws, the operation of the “peryahan” is also obstructing the PCSO’s expansion of its Small Town Lottery (STL) operations, which have already weaned people from the countryside from illegal gambling activities.Balutan warned the betting public that the real victims will be ordinary people who have been and will be arrested because they are working as bet collectors and lottery personnel of an illegal activity.",1

I’ve been in the local scene for so long, my husband was mayor for so long, it is very important for local folks to see their government officials during and right after a disaster .”DONT FORGET TO SHARE!RELATED POSTS:My friends and I have talked about Leni Robredo since the time she rose to national fame after the death in 2012 of her husband, the late Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo. For the next couple of years, she established a reputation for having a modest lifestyle. Do you still remember the time when she ditched the SONA Red Carpet and used the Batasan Pambansa backdoor entrance instead?Yes, she's the simple and meek widow that is Leni Robredo. For years, I had a positive opinion of her. That is, until I started my blog ThinkingPinoy, until I started looking harder into what have transpired in the past several years.I started having suspicions about Leni’s qualifications as a government official when I first heard the rumor that she flunked her bar exams, a rumor that was later verified when Leni admitted it herself [ Inq ].While failing the bar is not the end of the world, I was never able to wrap my head around the idea that someone who aspires to be the second most powerful person in the Philippines is not the sharpest tool in the shed.When I chat with friends, I often explain my position on that matter by using an analogy.I ask them, “If you need to undergo a major surgery, would you be okay with having a surgeon who flunked the medical board?”They answer back, “Of course, not!”Then I ask, “If we need new and better legislation, would you be okay with having a legislator who flunked the bar exams?”They answer back, “Of course, not!”Then I ask, ""And what if that legislator wanted to be vice-president?""Then an eerie silence.Yup, there’s something wrong somewhere in this equation.Yes, I started to have my doubts about the Leni Robredo as painted by the media, so I revisited the SONA Red Carpet Incident that basically transformed a simple widow into a national symbol of humility.The story goes something like this:She purportedly didn’t like the attention, but she publicized a photo of the incident herself [ FB ].Oh, and do you remember the viral 2014 Leni-taking-a-bus PR stunt?The Inquirer described the photo (shown below) as “taken by the lawmaker’s friend Keisha del Castillo last December 4, showed a woman waiting alone at a gas station in Magallanes, Makati City, donned in a striped shirt and denim pants and carrying two bags [ Inq ].”As it turns out, this Keisha del Castillo is not only Robredo’s friend, but also her long-time staffer. Based on her [ LinkedIn ] account, del Castillo was Leni’s “Head Executive Assistant” at the time the photo was taken.She then became Robredo’s Chief of Staff and eventually, the head of Private and Ceremonial Affairs Office under the Office of the Vice-president.In short, Robredo’s own office bragged again about her humility, even going as far as creating a video about it two years later, for use as 2016 campaign material.And do you still remember the Liberal Party’s campaign planes?For someone who allegedly espouses good governance, I cannot, for the life of me, understand how she could stomach riding Roxas’s campaign planes when they were owned and funded by illegal miner Eric Guttierez, the same illegal miner who cheated on his taxes, destroyed an entire town, and terrorized its townsfolk [ TP: Campaign Planes ].But I am a political realist, so I have resigned myself to the idea that every politician lies and cheats… and the only thing that varies is the degree in which they do it. Thus, until election election day, Robredo was my Number 2 pick. That is, if my primary bet Alan Peter Cayetano loses, I sincerely wished that she win instead.And she won, and she got worse.Leni managed to raise my eyebrows when I found out that she spent P418 million during the 2016 campaign, or about 30% more than the second-biggest VP spender Chiz Escudero [ CNN ].And where did she get the money? She said she got it from “creative” volunteers, including a Lugawan [ ABS ].That’s one hell of lugaw vendor if you ask me.From that ABS-CBN report, it appears that she has a very good idea as to where her campaign money came from, yet she still failed to file her Statements of Campaign Expenditures on time. To make matters worse, she even cited an obsolete Comelec resolution to justify the tardiness [ TP: SOCE ].Yes, here’s a lawyer who doesn’t know the laws that apply to her.But it still gets worse.Then came the Le-Knee incident, where she blasted the President for commenting about her knees.Yes, the humble and meek widow has metamorphosed into Our Lady of Naga.But what I still fail to understand is how Leni could find a joke about knees anti-woman, when she finds physical contact with a married man acceptable?The man closest to her at the moment, Quezon City Representative Bolet Banal, is married.This also begs the question, “Why still capitalize on the legacy of your dead husband when you seem to have a suitable replacement already?”There’s a word for it: Hypocrisy.But it gets worse.Just three weeks into the vice-presidency, Robredo started to decry extrajudicial killings allegedly committed by the Duterte Administration [ Star ]. She yakked about it month after month, and she still yaks about it up to this day [ CNN ]. Five months have passed since she first mentioned EJKs, yet she still fails to provide even an iota of evidence showing that these killings were state-sponsored.President Duterte, probably out of exasperation, even went as far telling her on 17 December 2016:It has been ten days since Duterte unleashed that dare, yet Leni has yet to respond.After her much-publicized resignation from the Duterte Cabinet, many of her critics (and there are lots of them) see Robredo as a NATO leader.Why so?Because a closer look at her purported achievements shows that it's mostly made up of meetings, conferences, paperwork, and little else. Even the implementing rules and regulations of a small section of a 1992 Republic Act took her five months to draft [ CNN ].Yes, it appears that Robredo suffers from the same illness Roxas had: Analysis Paralysis [ IBTimes ].But then, there still was a small part of me that wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. After all, she’s been in office of just five months.Leni just had to have the right opportunity to show her capacity for action.And that opportunity came. And the opportunity’s name is Nina.On 22 December 2016, [ GMA ] reported that Typhoon Nina (International Name: Nock-ten) was about to hit the Philippines, and that it was expected to make landfall on the Bicol Region – Leni’s own bailiwick – on Christmas Day. According to the report, Nina was anticipated to become a Category 3 Hurricane.The United States National Hurricane Center describes a Category 3 Hurricane as:By 23 December 2016 (Manila), NASA’s Aqua Satellite showed Nina has intensified [ Phys ].In preparation, the Duterte Government has evacuated hundreds of thousands of Bicolanos to safer areas. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) is on heightened alert, while Social Welfare Sec. Judy Taguiwalo has activated response clusters to ensure close coordination and quick mobilization of assistance for communities likely to be affected by the typhoon [ Star ].Yes, even on Christmas Day, the Duterte Government is at work: no vacations, no days off, no R and R... while Leni did the exact opposite.Despite all that’s happening, Robredo still decided to leave the country for a US vacation. Take a look at the following image taken at NAIA at 4:40 PM Friday, 23 December 2016.This is the problem when a politician conducts too many press conferences: people notice bouts of deafening silence.No, the US-bound flight was not part of an official trip, as Robredo’s official trips are very well-publicized ahead of time. This is a personal trip that Robredo herself knows is ill-timed.This woman, my friends, is part of the group that calls for Duterte's resignation, the same group who's plotting his ouster [ TP: Plan 0117 ]. The same woman who will become President should that call be heeded.The same woman who loves to contradict herself.Let’s recall a 20 October 2015 interview where she herself said:Now, Robredo herself said “it is very important for local folks to see their government officials during and right after a disaster”.Straight from the horse’s mouth, and where was she while Nina was pummeling her hometown in Bicol?Vacationing in the United States.Leni left the Philippines last Friday knowing full well that she’s badly needed by Bicolandia. She left despite her full knowledge that she must stay.In short, she left the Philippines for the United States… “like a thief in the night.” [ ThinkingPinoy Did you like this post?

"If someone said the Supreme Court decision may have been wrong, then that same persons can show me where in the decision a judges reasoning is unsound, illogical, circular etc… at which point a motion for reconsideration can be filed. That motion may not make it past a clerk, but the clerk does have to look at it and then is in the public record and everyone can stay reasonable.If that person fails to show me where in the Supreme Court decision something is wrong then that person is being unreasonable.I would expect the President to simply announce that his Office lawyers are going to file a motion of reconsideration or any motion for that matter. Because if anyone claims the decision was wrong', then that same person has to show where in the decision something is unreasonable, if they want to stay reasonable.Because an impeachment or revolution 'ought' not start just because some one simply claims the supreme court decision was wrong. If an impeachment or revolution starts just because some one claims the supreme court decision is 'wrong' then your impeachment or revolution is unreasonable.Stay reasonable Philippines.-------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"Filipino food regrettably ranks as one of the worst in the world - street food or otherwise. If you say to someone - 'how about Filipino tonight' - it does not conjure up going out to eat! The reason has little to do with poverty. In so many countries I visit it was the poverty which drove the initial creativity to maximise variety and flavor from very basic choices and to experiment with ingredients.It seems more to do with a generic culture of laziness and lack of creativity which extends to the kitchen. It is also that few learn to cook or take on board a passion for food, and unlike the curiosity of foreigners, Filipinos do not explore a wide range of cuisines but stick to what they know and suffer withdrawal symptoms if no rice.Food is predominantly basic rice 3 times a day (good luck with the diabetes), and anything thrown in oil and overcooked (good luck with heart disease) creating one brown mess on the plate (a forerunner of things to come!) and often served/eaten lukewarm. One's tastebuds soon go on strike. For the bone-idle there is the fallback which is the abomination and rip off called Jollibee - cruelty to the palateThe Philippines is the land which cooking forgot and which gourmands will never remember. A blank in the Michelin guide - no surprise there.It is regrettable because as with many areas it represents lost opportunity. Fusion cuisine has great potential and a natural affinity.Fortunately the rest of Asia produces excellent food, with subtle and surprising combinations, beautiful and colorful presentation, all garnished with excellent service.The joke for travellers used to getting the Delhi Belly, now it is the Manila Killa.Visitors should just consider the Philippines as a culinary desert, with the schools providing assembly line 'chefs' for the cruise ships. Masterchef it ain't.A few ex-pat chefs such as Billy King can muster a decent spread on a good day, and Sofitel remains consistently good, thanks to French flair and an excellent GM. Chef Pengson at the Goose Station may be pretentious but tries, and your wallet will remember the experience. But apart from high end restaurants, overall there is a need to improve, particularly if tourists are going to have an enjoyable and memorable stay (for the right reasons) and recommend the country, and also to improve the health of all.And unlike the food, which is often as tough as old boots, Filipinos are emotional souls incapable of taking constructive criticism so food critics can expect to be 'persona non grata' if you have higher standards than a Chinese take-away or an American throwaway.Gordon Ramsay would be on expletive overdrive, but Andrew Zimmern in 7th Heaven, and Dan Brown in hell's kitchenAnd if tourists have those views then people can either be butthurt and adopt an ostrich approach or be open, proactive and improve standards and change the reputation, or tourists can simply visit other countries in Asia.Source:http://getrealphilippines.com/blog/2014/03/filipino-food/comment-page-1/#comment-228646",0

"TWO top officials of the Bureau of Immigration (BI) are in hot water for allegedly extorting P50 million from Chinese businessman Jack Lam, the biggest online gaming operator in the country, prompting them to take a 30-day leave of absence to give way to an investigation.The amount was supposedly in exchange for the release of 600 out of a total of 1,316 undocumented Chinese who were rounded up by combined immigration and Special Action Force (SAF) elements in Fontana Leisure Park in Clark, Pampanga for working without permit in the Lam-operated online casino.Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente on Monday ordered Associate Commissioners Al C. Argosino and Michael B. Robles, along with Acting BI intelligence chief Charles T. Calima, to submit their written explanation within 24 hours on the circumstances surrounding the alleged extortion.“This initiative is separate from the NBI [National Bureau of Investigation] [probe] ordered by Department of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre 2nd. We will support this and any other parallel investigation on the matter,” Morente said in a memorandum.“The Bureau of Immigration has been consistent in adhering to the guidance of President Rodrigo Duterte to upgrade the level of service to all our clients and weed out corruption in the bureaucracy. We have taken pains to address all irregularities with impartiality and will continue to take decisive action as needed,” the BI chief added.Argosino and Robles are President Duterte’s fraternity brothers in Lex Taleonis.The embattled officials filed a 30-day leave of absence effective December 12 to give a freehand to the ongoing investigation against them.“In the interest of justice and in our adherence to the Rule of Law and our belief in the truth, we are taking aleave of absence from our duties as Deputy Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration for thirty days effective today, December 12, 2016,” Argosino and Robles said in an official statement.Even as they neither confirmed nor denied the allegations leveled against them, the two maintained that “we fully and wholeheartedly support President Duterte’s war against corruption in government.”The BI spokesman, lawyer Ma. Antonette Mangrobang, has confirmed that 600 of the Chinese have already been released from their temporary detention at the Fontana Convention Center.“They were released after their petitions for bail were approved by the BI Board of Commissioners,” Mangrobang told The Manila Times.The BI Board of Commissioners is composed of Morente, Agrosino and Robles.According to Mangrobang, there are still more than 700 left in detention, with some of them also having pending petitions for bail.Earlier, the Justice secretary disclosed that Lam’s illegal gambling operation in Clark is being protected by a well-entrenched syndicate, which was able to effect the escape of more than 1,000 other undocumented Chinese during the raid in Fontana.Aguirre said Lam does not have a permit to operate from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), which means that he is not paying a single cent to the government.The Justice secretary has disclosed that Lam, through an emissary, retired Police General Wally Sombero, tried to bribe him and Chairman Andrea Domingo of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp.Earlier, a lawyer for Lam has denied Sombero’s role as an emissary nor has the authority to negotiate in behalf of the Chinese businessman.But journalist Ramon Tulfo, in his column last Friday, said it was Sombrero who divulged to him the alleged P50 million payoff, which was paid in two tranches of P20 million and P30 million, at the City of Dreams Hotel and Casino in Pasay City (Metro Manila).The payoff was reportedly captured on CCTV and the whole conversation between the two associate commissioners and Sombero was recorded.The whole transaction, according to Tulfo, was also witnessed by Calima, a retired police general like Sombero.",1
"General Santos City- Security forces busted a narco-terrorist network in Mindanao, Monday, following the arrest of a senior leader of Ansar-Al Khilafah (AKP) terror group in an anti-illegal operation in Maasim, Sarangani.Gil Cesario Castro, regional director of Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, said PDEA agents and military intelligence operatives arrested Morsalen Mashod,45, in a buy-bust operation in Barangay Kanalo, Maasim, Sarangani.According to Castro, Mashod was a close confidante of AKP leader Mohammad Jaafar Maguid, who is also known as Commander Tokboy.Maguid, considered as one of the top leaders of the AKP, was slain in an encounter with security forces in Kiamba, Sarangani last January.After his death, it was reported that Mashod was already re-organizing Maguid’s AKP cell after he was killed.Also confiscated from Mashod were several grams of shabu worth P20,000.“The suspect was included in the narco-terrorism watch list issued by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte,” Castro said.“Mashod knew very well the logistical and operational structures of the AKP,” he added.",1
"THE Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Navy on Monday kicked off a joint exercise that seeks to enhance their inter-operability and operation capabilities in performing territorial defense operations.Now on its 10th year, the exercise codenamed “Dagit 2016,” aims to further improve capabilities of both units in joint air and naval operations in support not only of territorial defense operations but also in the conduct of Internal Security Operations (ISO) and in support of Territorial Defense Operations (TDO).Lt. Sahirul Taib, spokesman for the Philippine Navy Fleet, said the exercise will be conducted in areas around Naval Base Heracleo Alano, Sangley Point, Cavite City; Marine Barracks Gregorio Lim (MBGL), Ternate, Cavite; Manila Bay; and Caballo Island.It would be carried out in three phases– preparation phase from October 17 to 23; exercise phase from October 24 to 27; and the final phase on October 28.The exercise phase is the Field Training Exercise (FTX), which includes subject matter expertise exchanges (SMEEs), classroom instructions, table top exercise (TTX) and joint training exercise (JTX).Rear Admiral Bayani Gaerlan, Philippine Fleet commander, said in his speech during the opening ceremony that the exercise will surely advance the Navy and the Air Force units’ inter-operability in joint maritime security operations as well as foster camaraderie among officers and men of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).“This exercise aims to enhance our unit’s operational capability in joint maritime security operations, and improvement of areas of inter-operability and other joint training opportunities between the Navy and Air Force and it will also test and improve on the inter-operability of our new equipment, ships and aircraft and especially among our personnel,” he pointed out.The drill started in 2003 during the term of then-Navy Capt. Jose Luis Alano, with the Naval Air Group and 15th Strike Wing as the only participating units involved.In 2007, it eventually evolved to what is now known as the PN-PAF IOX or Inter-operability Exercise when both branches of service have realized the importance of the role being played by each service in actual operations in the area of responsibility of different unified commands.The Philippine Marines and their US counterpart recently concluded the 33rd joint military exercise called Philippine Amphibious Landing Exercise or Phiblex, which could be the last in the six-year term of President Rodrigo Duterte who has been scathingly attacking the United States, even threatening to revoke an agreement that allows American forces to conduct activities in agreed locations inside Philippine military bases.",1
"Different cities in the Philippines is now preparing for the upcoming Duterte administration.Netizens noticed that laws are now implemented very well in different places in Metro Manila.One of the example is the shocking change happened in Baclaran, Paranaque City, in the past the place is known for being dirty and full of trash because of many no littering violators, but today people who will violate the no littering law will be arrested and can face 500 pesos fine.The illegal vendors, illegal parkers and some establishment was also removed so the road will become more spacious.Netizens are very happy that many places in NCR who used to be full of trash is now very clean.Supporters of Rody Duterte are hoping that they will continue implementing laws so the Philippines will become one of the cleanest places in the world someday.Netizens are now also confident to use their smartphones in Recto Manila and show that the street once swarmed by robbers, snatchers and trash is now changing slowly.",0

"Hopefully this makes sense (also this is not legal advice)...There are several grounds for annulment under Philippine law (fraud, mentally insane, impotence). Most of these are common contract defenses (they negate the existence of a contract of marriage).Almost all these grounds (and this is key) have to exist the moment the partners marry. Only then can you annul a marriage. So it becomes hard to prove as you have show that a person defrauded you or was mentally unstable on the day of the marriage. Another favorite ground is psychological incapacity to contract marriage. Again you have to show that this incapacity existed at the time of the marriage. After being married for more than a couple of years, this is hard to do. The standard of proof is very high.Annulment is a run around on all this….a run around that exists only because the Philippine justice system is, let's say, engages in the monetizing of justice. The parties who want to have their marriage annul go through the lower regional trial court, get an annulment and (this is another key point) either MUST not appeal the annulment to the supreme court.If it were appealed the supreme court would take a hard look at the case, apply the higher proof standards and overturn the annulment because the parties have failed to prove that there were sufficient grounds for annulment. The Supreme Court would then say that there is no divorce in the Philippines to back up its reasoning.There you have it a no-divorce policy that effectively encourages the people in conjunction with the Philippine lower courts to subvert the law/engage in corruption for expediency's sake.---------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"The graduates couldn’t have been more different from each other: an engineer, a funeral service provider, a seminarian, a teacher, a US postal worker, a policeman, a lawyer and two doctors.What binds them together— aside from being mayors of poor, mostly upland towns in the provinces of Ilocos Sur, Pangasinan and La Union—is their commitment to public health.Along with their health officers, these local chief executives were recently recognized for completing the Municipal Leadership and Governance Program (MLGP) of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Zuellig Family Foundation (ZFF).The graduates proved that even the most disadvantaged barrio or sitio can meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) if their leaders are truly committed.The MDGs are eight time-bound targets drafted by the United Nations in 2000 to reduce extreme poverty in the world. Three of the goals—reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases—are health-related.The conditions that gave rise to the MDGs are nothing new to the mayor-graduates. Several of them recalled personal struggles with health-related concerns worsened by the geographical isolation of their areas.“We know now that even a fourth-class municipality can render first-class service to its constituents,” said Mayor Divina Velasco of San Gabriel, La Union.Velasco’s mother used to be the public health nurse in San Gabriel, a mountainous area with an 85-percent indigenous population.Town’s burdenWith no doctor nor midwife assigned to the place, Velasco said she felt early on how difficult the job was for her mother and what a burden it was for the town to depend on only one individual for their health needs.“I told myself, I will be the first doctor of our town,” she recalled thinking.After passing the board exam, Velasco returned to San Gabriel and served as its municipal health officer for 16 years before being elected mayor.Others might think her post lowly, she said. “They say I should be in Manila specializing in a prestigious hospital, or in the US, like my sisters, but the desire to serve in my own town was intense,” Velasco said.While Velasco credited her mother for her career choice, Gregorio del Pilar, Ilocos Sur, Mayor Luz Villalobos cited a child lost at birth for hers.Like many rural women, Villalobos was used to the idea of giving birth at home.Home-based deliveries, often unassisted by health professionals, are frequent causes of maternal and infant deaths. But in places like Gregorio del Pilar, where there was no nurse, no doctor, no birthing facility and no hospital, home-based deliveries are the only option for mothers.“But as a leader, I realized I’m responsible for starting change,” Villalobos said. “My constituents look to me to improve their situation.”Having finished only elementary grade—her father had leprosy and could not send her to school—Villalobos was hesitant to join the MLGP. But when she learned that the mayors of neighboring towns were joining, she was encouraged to join as well.The MLGP corrected her wrong, but well-intentioned, ideas about making do with whatever resources were at hand.Formalin for wounds“We own a funeral parlor so we had a lot of Formalin. I used to give that to farmers with wounds on their feet because we had no other medicine. That’s how poor we are,” the mayor said.A strong disinfectant, Formalin, however, has some side effects and is not suitable for treating wounds.Sugpon, another geographically isolated and disadvantaged area in Ilocos Sur, has no hospital. On rainy days, the town can be reached only by boat on the Amburayan River.To deliver health services, Sugpon’s leaders, many of them belonging to the Bago-Kankanaey tribe, had to be extra creative.They put in place the Ambulansyang de Paa—a group of men who take turns carrying sick and pregnant townsfolk on a makeshift bed to the nearest health facility. Usually, this makeshift ambulance takes hours of walking.Hitting on a more permanent solution, the municipal government allocated P700,000 to build Bahay ni Nanay, a halfway house located near the birthing center, where pregnant women can stay while awaiting their delivery date, so they no longer have to travel from far-flung villages where transport is not available.Quirino, Ilocos Sur, Mayor Clifford Patil-ao, an engineer, knows only too well the risks of living in the mountains with no access to any means of transport.Carried in blanketSickly as a child, he recalled being carried in a blanket by neighbors so that he and his parents could cross a river and ride a rented jeep to Bessang Pass Memorial Hospital in Cervantes, Ilocos Sur.He was lucky because he survived. Many others don’t make it.“I’ve seen pregnant women who, after the midwife had given up on them, would be carried by the townsfolk in the middle of the night across the mountains for three hours to reach the nearest hospital. Some babies die in the womb; some are born on the way,” Patil-ao said.When he had his own family, health again became a personal issue: His eldest child was born with two holes in the heart. Patil-ao moved his family to Bauang, La Union, so they could be closer to doctors.“One day, my child’s heartbeat just stopped, and we had to rush him to the hospital. The doctors were able to save him, but I thought: If we had been in Quirino, our child probably would have died,” Patil-ao said.Quirino is the farthest and most isolated of Ilocos Sur’s 14 upland municipalities. It has a population of around 9,300.Burdened by the thought of his townsfolk suffering because they lacked access to health services, Patil-ao returned to his hometown and won mayor in 2007.Again, he experienced life like most of his constituents did, especially when he figured twice in life-threatening accidents. Once, he fell from the roof of a school he was inspecting; another time, he was thrown off a motorcycle. In both times, he could not be taken to the hospital until a day later because there was no ambulance.Patil-ao knew then that he had to make health a priority.Today, Quirino has a doctor, a community hospital, two ambulances, and a health center that is open 2",1
"Distribution of health forms to arriving passengers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) may be resumed over a reported outbreak again of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa.Bureau of Quarantine (BoQ) personnel on Monday said they are only waiting for the instruction or ‘go-signal’ from the Department of Health (DoH) to resume the distribution, which was stopped in February this year after all kinds of virus were reportedly put under control.Although it stopped the distribution of the health forms, the bureau maintained its fever scanning system 24/7, according to physician Geraldine Yangson.Manila has no direct flights from Congo but Quarantine bureau personnel strictly monitor arriving passengers with connecting flights from Middle East countries and those from Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.“If given the go-signal, we will resume the distribution of the health forms to all passengers on these flights,” Yangson said.Three years ago, airport and health authorities tightened screening of arriving passengers at the NAIA amid fears of a worldwide spread of the Ebola virus.Passengers of all foreign flights arriving at the NAIA terminals were required to fill out health declaration checklists, which asked for travel histories, addresses and contact details.Also, passengers coming from all destinations had to walk past thermal scanners set up in quarantine desks.The World Health Organization confirmed that at least one person had died after contracting the Ebola virus, signaling another outbreak of the disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.General Manager Ed Monreal of the Manila International Airport Authority has instructed airport personnel to make sure that there are enough hand soaps and sanitizers in all toilets at the four terminals of NAIA.",1
"Let's face it; life would be boring without those who oppose our views. The challenge to all who rabidly try to prove they make more sense than the other party is to discuss their views rationally without resorting to character assassination. The question now is: are Filipinos ready for this kind of set-up? There is enough evidence to suggest that most of them are not.If you want to get a chance to be heard, you need to give others a chance to have his or her say as well. Whatever your beliefs are, simply putting yourself in the other person's shoes would help you understand that listening and giving importance to others is the best defense.A lot of people have this misguided notion that we should be free to do or say whatever we want. But with freedom comes great responsibility. There is a price to pay when we do things without caring for the consequences of our actions. We may not realize it instantly but sometime in the future we will find ourselves in the same situation that others were in while we made fun of them or acted indifferently towards them. Just remember that ""for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"".Life is a game and there are certain rules we must follow in order to live in harmony with our surroundings. We all need to abide by a certain guideline or a code wherever we go whether it is written or unwritten – in school, our office and public places. Sadly, in Philippine society, most Filipinos do not follow anything whether it is written or not. Instead, each Filipino lives by his or her own set of rules and the results speak for itself.In a mature society, members of the community do not need to be reminded of the rules all the time. They use their common sense, which is not something that most Filipinos have.",0

We want CamSur to set new standards,” Villafuerte said during the project’s recent launch at the Dusit Thani Hotel in Makati City.The Capitol building, which the Bicol solon further described as “groundbreaking and unique,” will be located in the town of Pili.More importantly, Villafuerte said the project would also jumpstart a massive infrastructure modernization program in Camarines Sur that’s akin to the national government’s ambitious Build, Build, Build initiative.This local effort will include the expansion of the Naga Airport in the town of Pili; the modernization of the Philippine National Railways (PNR) line; the CamSur West Coast Tourism Highway that will connect the towns of Balatan, Pasacao and Ragay; and the Bicol River bridge that will connect the town of Libmanan to Naga City.",1
"The islands of Hawaii are a convenient and strategic place for deposed, disgraced and criminally-charged Philippine politicians when fleeing, or trying to flee, their country. Honolulu became the temporary home of the late Ferdinand Marcos, his wife Imelda and their children when the dictator was forced to leave the Philippines following the historic People’s Power Revolution.Another former president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, more popularly referred to as ‘GMA,’ is rumored to be planning an escape to Hawaii’s Big Island. GMA is currently under hospital arrest for criminal charges of plunder and electoral fraud committed while she was president.GMA’s plan just went poooof!Hawaii’s mayor Billy Kenoi has signed a bill that bans genetically-engineered crops and plants, better known as GMO. Bill 113 was passed by the Hawaii County Council last November.Arroyo’s chief of staff delivered the bad news to her at her hospital bed at a government hospital in Manila. The chief of staff did not realize that he had misread the news from Hawaii, thinking that the Big Island had just banned his boss, GMA, from coming to the islands.Now, the Hawaii County Council picked up the idea. It is now considering a bill to ban GMA, in addition to the already banned GMO.",0
"President Aquino on Tuesday revealed there was an “alternative truth” to the Mamasapano debacle, eight months after the bloody encounter that claimed the lives of police commandos, civilians and Moro rebels, and set back the passage of a Bangsamoro law that could have been his legacy. The President said the photo of Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias “Marwan,” showing him dead in his hut that came out in the Inquirer on Jan. 30 “posed many questions and that is what we want to resolve.”The so-called alternative truth, “may have very serious unintended consequences. Lives are at serious risk,” said one Inquirer source who asked not to be named for lack of authority to talk on the matter.Various other sources also told the Inquirer that the photograph raised more questions than answers for the government even as then police Special Action Force (SAF) commander, Director Getulio Napeñas, said the operation was a success because his men took down Marwan.Among these were why Marwan was half-naked and how the SAF was able to take pictures from such an angle if there was a firefight going on.“There are certain quarters who did point out certain questions that arose from viewing that picture. Does this support the so-called official version of what transpired? Now, if it doesn’t support [the official version], can it be explained or not? That is an ongoing process. There is no conclusion at this point,” the President said.He added that investigators were now looking for the witnesses “that will prove or disprove certain observations.”But investigators were having a “difficult” time getting the witnesses, he said.This was one of the reasons why Aquino said he would rather “not talk too deeply about the specifics because it might really hamper our efforts to get to the truth of this matter—the complete truth.”He said that a meeting had been set next week to “discuss the specifics” of the indictment of over a hundred individuals over the deaths of the SAF commandos and the civilians caught in the crossfire.Under intense scrutinyAquino disclosed the continuing investigation after Philippine Daily Inquirer editor in chief Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc, during the Meet Inquirer Multimedia forum, asked him if he has had closure on the fiasco that saw his approval rating drop down to its lowest.“Do I have closure? I still have quite a number of questions, and there are various agencies of government tasked to ferret out the truth of exactly what happened in its entirety. There is an alternative version of events that happened there, which is undergoing very intense scrutiny,” Aquino said.According to the different investigations conducted of the incident, the SAF commandos engaged Marwan and his men in a firefight in Mamasapano, Maguindanao province, on Jan. 25. Eventually, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and its splinter group, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), joined the fray that left 44 SAF troopers dead.The bloodbath was largely blamed on the MILF, with whom the government has signed a peace agreement. But Napeñas admitted he bypassed the ceasefire agreement between the government and the MILF because he distrusted the military and the rebels themselves.While the debacle set back the passage of the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), envisioned as the alternative to the secessionist movement of the MILF, Aquino said he did not think war would break out should Congress fail to pass the landmark legislation.No threat of war“I don’t submit to the premise that war will break out. I don’t think there is any interest from the major players to re-engage in a bloody conflict,” he said.But he did not discount the spoilers “who will want to exploit the current difficulties to show that their avowed aims of gaining what they want through violent means is the only way to go about it.”“So those of us who are advocating peace should really even redouble our efforts to thwart these groups who would want us to branch again into really a pointless conflict,” he said.“So, who should be blamed? I think I’ll leave that up to the Filipino people who will have an opportunity in next year’s elections to gauge the merit, or lack of it, of the people who will propose to lead various offices.”Optimistic of passageThe President remained optimistic that the BBL would be passed despite the “difficulties” it faced in Congress.He said both Senate President Franklin Drilon and House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. have “expressed confidence that the BBL will be passed.”The President also emphasized the need to continue with the “engagement of our dialogue partners,” especially the MILF.“We want them to experience, and the population, in general, in this region the benefits or the so-called peace dividends arising from this agreement,” Aquino said.He asked Congress to support “these initiatives,” such as the Sajahatra Bangsamoro, “that will shower these people with the peace dividends and get them further engaged in the process.”He also said that the executive department would continue to lobby with the members of Congress to pass the proposed BBL “during our watch and pass it at the earliest possible time, so that the new mode of governance will have the maximum time to show the effectivity or the efficacy of this new mode of governance.",1
"SottoBut Senate President Vicente Sotto III said the Upper Chamber will not allow Trillanes or any other senator to be arrested within its premises.Sotto, in an interview following a meeting with Trillanes, said senators agreed that authorities should not be allowed to arrest the opposition lawmaker inside the Senate building to preserve the institution’s dignity.“To preserve the dignity of the Senate, we have decided not to allow any senator to be arrested within Senate premises. Outside Senate premises, that’s no longer our concern but within Senate premises that is the decision of the leadership,” he said.As of press time last night, Trillanes has decided to stay at the Senate premises.Aside from authorizing the arrest of Trillanes, Duterte ordered the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) “to pursue all criminal and administrative cases” against the beleaguered senator in relation to the two mutinous incidents.The Philippine National Police (PNP) and the AFP have also been directed “to employ all lawful means to apprehend” Trillanes“so he could be recommitted to the detention facility where he had been incarcerated for him to stand trial for the crimes he is charged with.”‘Amnesty can’t be revoked’But Trillanes explained that the granting of an amnesty is an act of Congress and cannot be superseded by an Executive Order.“Hindi mo pwedeng bawiin ang amnesty. Ano ba yun? I was already subjected to that nung na-try ako tapos na dismiss. Ano ngayon, uulitin yun? Ano ba yan?Magpaturo nga sila sa mga law students (You can’t revoke an amnesty. I was already tried and the case was dismissed. So now, it will be tried again? They should seek advice from law students),” the beleaguered senator said.The Senate minority bloc, led by Senator Franklin Drilon, backed Trillanes and questioned the legality of Proclamation No. 572, saying that the amnesty granted by the Aquino administration was valid and already ruled upon by the courts.“I’m sorry but we strongly believe that the amnesty is valid; number two, the validity of the application of Senator Trillanes was already ruled upon by the court when the court dismissed the rebellion and coup d’etat case against Sen. Trillanes on the basis of the amnesty,” Drilon told reporters in a hastily called press conference with the latter outside his office.DOJ seeks arrest warrantWhile Duterte authorized the arrest of Trillanes, the DOJ filed Tuesday afternoon before the Makati regional trial court (RTC) a motion asking for the issuance of an alias warrant and a hold-departure order (HDO) against the senator. However, there were reports that it will take the RTC around three to four days to issue the alias arrest warrant.Guevarra also said the DOJ will reopen the charges against Trillanes over the Oakwood mutiny and the Manila Peninsula siege.“After proper review of the records of this case, we have determined that it is something that is ripe for reopening that there are grounds to reopen the case, then the first order of the day is simply to ask the court for the issuance of an alias warrant so that the person of the accused will be brought in the custody of the court,” Guevarra told reporters.In 2010, then President Aquino issued Proclamation No. 75 granting amnesty to active and former military and policemen and their supporters involved in the Oakwood mutiny, Marines stand-off in 2006, and the Manila Peninsula incident.Trillanes, a former Navy officer detained for seven years at the PNP custodial center pending his trial, was among the officers allowed to walk free by Aquino.Not in amnesty listBut Acting Prosecutor General Richard Anthony Fadullon revealed Tuesday that Trillanes was not in the list submitted by the Amnesty Commission to the court trying the coup d’etat charges.Fadullon recalled that in 2010, Makati City RTC Branch 148 Judge Oscar Pimentel was supposed to hand down a decision on the coup d’etat case concerning the Oakwood mutiny when defense lawyers filed manifestations that all 31 accused have sought amnesty. Pimentel eventually suspended the promulgation.Pimentel later retired and Judge Andres Soriano took over.In 2013, Fadullon said, the court approved the list submitted by the Amnesty Commission.“But when I looked at the records, it did not include Sen. Trillanes,” said Fadullon, referring to the list submitted by the Amnesty Commission.Trillanes back as militaryMeanwhile, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) spokesman Colonel EdgardArevalo said that President Duterte’s revocation of the amnesty granted to Trillanes in connection with two attempts to overthrow the Arroyo administration effectively brings him back to his former status as a military personnel.“That being the case, he will again be subject of military regulation, including the Articles of War which every military personnel in the active service is supposed to be subjected,” he added.Arevalo said even though Trillanes is already retired from the military service, he can be again subjected to court martial proceedings.“Therefore, yung (the) court martial will have to be re-constituted kasi ‘yungibang (because the other) members ng (of the) court martial has already retired. So in which case, the acting AFP Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Salvador Mison Jr., has already instructed the convening of a general court martial that shall be hearing the case of Lt. Trillanes,” he added.The military spokesman told reporters that court martial proceedings against Trillanes was only stopped after amnesty was granted to him by then President Aquino in 2010.

"Vice President Leni Robredo on Wednesday said this was the time for Filipinos to be united for the sake of the country’s security after President Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao, even as civil society groups warned that the declaration would lead to more human rights violations.“Let us trust our AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines),” said Robredo, who visited the AFP headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo on Wednesday morning for a briefing on the situation in Marawi City, which is under attack by a group affiliated with the Islamic State.Asked if she agreed with the declaration of martial law or if it was an overreaction, she said it was hard to say.“For me, let us wait for the official declaration of the President. Anyway, under the Constitution, within 48 hours, the President will send information to Congress as to why (martial law) is needed,” Robredo said.She called on the people to “pray for our men and women who are protecting the people of Marawi” and “for our fellow Filipinos who are caught in the crossfire.”Respect for human rightsThe military assured the Vice President that human rights would be respected while implementing martial law in Mindanao.“We will respect human rights and we will recognize existing law,” said Marine Col. Edgard Arevalo, AFP public information office chief.Though supportive of the government’s strong action against local terrorists ensconced in Marawi, civil society groups and nongovernment organizations were wary over Mr. Duterte’s placing Mindanao under martial law.The groups aired their concern over possible human rights abuses following Mr. Duterte’s statement that his martial law would be “harsh” and would be no different from that imposed by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1972.“Let us be clear, the Maute group-Abu Sayyaf and/or [IS] wannabes operating in Marawi must be stopped. The burning of civilian facilities such as the UCCP school must be strongly condemned,” Renato Reyes, secretary general of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, said in a statement.“However, we oppose Duterte’s martial law declaration because it is open to all sorts of abuses by state security forces notorious for human rights violations,” Reyes said.Aerial, artillery strikesSuara Bangsamoro expressed concern about reports that aerial and artillery bombing would be conducted by state forces to eradicate the Maute group in Marawi.“We fear for the lives of the civilians who might get caught in the crossfire. We fear for the effects of war to the civilian population,” said Jerome Succor Aba, Suara Bangsamoro chair.Josua Mata of the labor group Sentro condemned what he labeled as an “atrocious attack” on the people of Marawi but said the declaration of martial law was “a heavy-handed response to the situation that even the AFP now claims is under control.”The military solution will not provide long-term solutions to terrorism and other problems in Mindanao, according to the indigenous peoples group Katribu.Diligence in merit reviewWarning against the return of dictatorship, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) called on legislators to exercise “due diligence” in reviewing the merits of Mr. Duterte’s martial rule in Mindanao.“Let us be reminded of the lessons of the 1972 declaration under a regime of a dictatorship, that we may never again repeat this dark past and continue to recognize the higher value of human dignity at all times,” the CHR said on Wednesday.It also reminded the government to uphold “the rights of all Filipinos” while addressing the terrorist attacks and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Marawi.The CHR stressed that despite the declaration of martial rule, the Constitution crafted after Marcos’ downfall assured respect for civil liberties and the protection of the rights to life, and freedom from torture, warrantless arrest, illegal detention and other human rights.LawlessnessKarapatan, a nongovernment human rights watchdog, said the martial law declaration would result in gross violations of people’s rights.“Martial law will inevitably result in intensified military operations, including aerial strikes which can kill and affect hundreds of civilians, and an open season for extrajudicial killings, illegal arrests, torture and other forms of rights violations,” said Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay.",1
"It’s beginning to emerge that there was a rivalry between gang leaders Herbert Colangco and Jaybee Sebastian within the New Bilibid Prison. It seems, in the midst of all that, Sebastian emerged as the one favoured for coddling by the Philippine Government during the administration of former President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III. Senator Leila De Lima, who was Aquino’s Justice Secretary at the time, herself admitted that Sebastian was an “asset” in that he supposedly “kept things in order” at the prison.But Colangco alleges that Sebastian also helped raise money for the Liberal Party campaign for the 2016 elections. And so what keeps pundits, activists, and observers busy nowadays is exchanging speculation surrounding this Colangco-said-Sebastian-said circus. The bigger point, however, is this: Guilty or not of accusations made by inmate Herbert Colangco, the fact remains, Bilibid Prisons had practically become a drug lord’s resort under the watch of the Aquino administration.Whatever the case, De Lima was responsible for ensuring that Bilibid Prisons be maintained as a penal facility and not a hub for the drug trade it had evidently become.The problem with De Lima is that, following her ouster as Senate Justice Committee chairman, she now plays the victim card like a loser. Rather than suffer the consequences of her approach with a level head, she spends her days at the Senate now updating the seemingly sympathetic Philippine news media industry on her “persecution”. Interestingly, De Lima’s behaviour in recent days presents a stark contrast to the quiet dignity exhibited by former President Gloria Arroyo when she herself was in a similar situation in 2011. Her dignified stance eventually earned her the respect of even people who used to hate her.De Lima also played a significant role in the demonisation of the late former Chief Justice Renato Corona during his impeachment trial in 2012. The story back then almost reads like today’s news…It was very uncomfortable to watch a woman of De Lima’s calibre reduced to defending her indefensible actions. The simple question asked by Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile on whether or not the Chief Justice acted alone in trying to enforce the TRO — to which De Lima replied, “The direct answer to that is no” — already reveals her untenable position. The fact that other justices are free to vote “yea” or “nay” is a testament to the freedom accorded them by the Supreme Court as an institution. And for De Lima to insinuate that the other justice’s decision can be easily swayed is an insult to the justices themselves as individuals and to the institution itself. De Lima also alleges that Chief Justice Renato Corona wanted to let GMA “leave the country in November despite her facing charges of electoral sabotage.” Her statement was inconsistent with how things truly transpired. We recall that GMA and former first Gentleman Jose Miquel Arroyo’s first attempt to leave was on the 15th of November 2011 and at that time, there were no charges filed against her. It was on this basis that the Supreme Court issued the TRO citing that their decision was “consistent with the constitutional provision on the presumption of innocence” because the Arroyos are not yet accused.Instead of yakking away in front of the cameras, De Lima should learn from the late Corona and GMA what it means to be a true representative of the Filipino people. Left on her own, she has come to stand for everything that is wrong with the archetypical Filipino character.",0

"Two years after figuring in a viral YouTube video showing her playing on a slot machine in an unnamed casino, which reportedly prompted President Benigno Aquino III to show her the door as Land Transportation Office (LTO) chief, former Assistant Transportation Secretary Virginia Torres recently showed up at the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to do business. She left empty-handed.READ: Yes, Virginia, there’s ban on gov’t execs going to casinosThe controversial ex-LTO head, said to be one of the President’s shooting buddies, gave customs personnel a big surprise when she showed up at the Customs-Intelligence Group (IG) office on Aug. 20 allegedly to negotiate the release of at least 64 shipping containers of smuggled Thai sugar worth more than P100 million.The shipments, misdeclared as general merchandise, were not covered by any import permits from the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA), an agency under the Department of Agriculture.Imported through dummy firms, the sugar was part of more than 120 shipments that were the subject of at least 24 alert orders issued by the IG during the past five months.Worse, Torres allegedly dropped the name of President Aquino and suggested that the proceeds from the sale of the illegally imported sugar would be used in the 2016 elections.Sought for comment, Customs Deputy Commissioner Jessie Dellosa confirmed to the Inquirer that Torres “paid a visit to the IG office to appeal her case.”Dellosa, a former Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff, said that while his staff—Special Assistant Willie Tolentino, former Customs Enforcement and Security Service (ESS) chief—politely listened to Torres’ plea, “the fact that the shipments were in violation of the law cannot be overlooked.”Dellosa asserted that “the ‘who’ in illegal imports has never been a consideration in meeting the IG’s actions on Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines-related concerns.”“Each and every case is reviewed and acted upon solely on the facts and circumstances,” Dellosa said.With the late 2013 launch of the customs bureau’s reform program, the IG “has upheld total objectivity, fairness and impartiality in pursuing its mandate of protecting government interests in revenue collections and our people from the entry of contraband,” he added.Shipment not hersContacted by phone, Torres admitted dropping by the IG office on Aug. 20 to see Dellosa and appeal the seizure of several shipments of imported “general merchandise.”“But I wasn’t able to talk to him. Instead, it was (Tolentino) who talked to me and took note of my request,” she said.Torres said the shipments were not hers. “I made the appeal on behalf of my friend (Philip Sy, who also showed up at the IG office minutes after Torres’ arrival),” she said.“That is why, when (Tolentino) explained to me that they could not release the sugar shipments, I reprimanded Philip. I didn’t know that they were smuggled sugar. I was told by Philip they’re general merchandise,” she said.Torres claimed that she had no knowledge of the import business.“Philip just asked me to help him,” she said, stressing “I’m not for illegal business,” referring to smuggling.Sy, described by customs insiders as a “customs player,” did not respond to this reporter’s request for an interview.Sugar planter“I’m busy here in Tarlac. I lease property in a hacienda,” Torres said, but did not name the sugar plantation.Torres also confirmed that she had been seeing Customs Commissioner Alberto Lina, whom she described as her “longtime friend.”“It was just a friendly visit…No business at all,” she said.A source from the Office of the Commissioner said that during her visit, Torres was accompanied by a “certain Colonel Liwanag” and a “certain Nory,” said to be a former driver at Malacañang.Customs personnel interviewed for this report disputed some of Torres’ claims.According to them, part of her conversation with Tolentino went like this:Tolentino: “I’m talking to you because you seem to have a problem.”Torres: “Yes. The sugar that just arrived has also come under alert order. We’re asking you for advice.”Tolentino: “When was the alert ordered?”Torres: “Ah, just recently.”Tolentino: “Is that yours?”Torres: “Yes. Philip, my partner, said . . .”Tolentino: “How many containers?”Torres: “Sixty-four.”Tolentino: “If it has come under alert order, it will be difficult for us to do anything.”Torres (chuckling): “Not all, please … And what we should do … Maybe something just needs to be signed and the shipments can be released.”Tolentino: “But why did you not get an import permit? Before I left ESS, the Task Force Pantalan seized (eight containers). That’s also sugar.”Torres: “That’s also mine, that’s why we are going after it.”Tolentino: “Ah, it’s also yours? Wow! Why?”Election time againTorres: “Help us, please (humming) … It’s election time again . . . Our problem is Deputy Commissioner Dellosa … Maybe we can meet … There are many smugglers. Why the others . . . I’ll follow you.”A source said Torres mentioned the President’s name and claimed she had contacts at the SRA.“I have contacts there. We have an SRA permit, but it’s local . . . Don’t we grow sugarcane at (Hacienda) Luisita? Were you not reported in newspapers as grateful to the President … ? I lease and we plant together,” Torres said.READ: Aquino ally leases lands from Luisita beneficiariesBoth President Aquino and Torres hail from Tarlac province. Torres, a native of La Paz town, served as LTO head in Tarlac before the President appointed her assistant transportation secretary to head the LTO in 2010.READ: In the Know: Virginia Torres’ ties to AquinosThe Sugar Alliance of the Philippines (SAP), the biggest group of sugar planters and millers in the country, said it was “very alarmed” because “if this report about Torres’ visit to the Bureau of Customs is validated, it proves that former government officials like Virginia Torres have been dropping and using the President’s good name in asking BOC officials to lift the alert orders on smuggled sugar shipments for their personal gain.”“It is likewise alarming that Ms Torres is allegedly intimating to customs officials that the funds will be used for the coming elections,” said Manuel Lamata, chair of the SAP.Lamata said the SAP had been “receiving reports that some government officials are using their position to act as power brokers at customs.”But “this is the first time for us to hear that an official brazenly and wantonly flaunted her alleged links to the President to get away without fear that somebody might hear or report her to the President himself,” he added.“To go to the BOC to allegedly negotiate an otherwise illegal deal is an act of either supreme confidence or desperation,” he said.Bad for local farmersThe SAP warned that releasing smuggled sugar to the local market would curtail demand. “Hence, nobody will buy local sugar anymore,” the group said.“It will also harm our farmers because they will be competing against sugar that has been highly subsidized by the Thai government. That’s cheap sugar to be dumped on us. Likewise, imported sugar is not subjected to any quality control tests here, making them suspect to use,” it said.Lamata has brought the issue to the attention of former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, now the presidential standard-bearer of the ruling Liberal Party in the 2016 elections.“We wanted Secretary Mar Roxas to look into this matter,” Lamata said, recalling Roxas’ promise, made in a speech during the recent Philippine Sugar Technology convention in Cebu City, that he would support the industry.“This is a golden opportunity for Secretary Mar to prove that he indeed has our backs and that the insinuation that the funds will be used for the elections is not true,” Lamata said.He urged Roxas to “look into the activities of these smugglers, especially those who use their perceived closeness to the powers-that-be to extract favors.”“At the very least, he needs to denounce the activities of these unscrupulous officials,” Lamata said.The SAP earlier called for the resignation of Lina for allegedly allowing sugar smuggling to flourish.Lina is “no good for the industry and no good for the country,” Lamata said.Sought for comment, Lina said: “That’s his right…but I serve at the pleasure of the President.”In a letter to President Aquino, the SAP condemned the “dramatic increase in sugar smuggling during the past four months.”That “sadly coincides with the appointment of Commissioner Lina as head of the BOC,” the SAP said, noting that in a previous letter to Malacañang, it “tried to warn” the President that “Commissioner Lina’s soft stance on smuggling will be perceived by criminal syndicates as a sign that the ports are now open for business.”Lina strongly denied the SAP’s claims, saying the customs bureau’s intensified campaign against sugar smuggling was a work in progress.RELATED STORIESCustoms seizes P85M worth of smuggled sugarTrader faces raps for sugar smuggling",1
"For whatever its worth, a president — who is honest and humble– is what makes President Duterte endear not just to the public but also to the businessmen doing business in the Philippines.George Barcelon, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), said these characteristics are good enough for the business community to cast their support to Duterte.“It’s just an observation but I think it’s very important. You know, lately we’ve seen, those who are asking how the President would take comments ‘no, suggestions,” he said.“The two letter ‘h’ that comes to mind: he’s humble and he’s honest. We’ve seen on the TV that he apologized. Rarely if you see somebody on top, at high level, that they realize that they, that, and they’re honest enough to say “I’m wrong.” Okay. So with that, I think it’s a good sign that he listens. Okay,” Barcelon said.Duterte had apologized twice in public– first over the wrong inclusion of a local official in his drug matrix and then to the Jewish community over his remarks about the Hitler and the holocaust.Duterte has been flak with criticisms over the human rights abuses that couple his anti-drug campaign.“And the most important thing is with the President, his heart is in his right place. So when somebody whose heart is in the right place and who listens, I think the chance for us na umangat tayo is very high. Thank you,” he added.",0
"Mayor Tomas Bongalonta, Jr. of Pili, Camarines Sur has been slapped with a 90-day suspension “pendente lite” (pending litigation) after the Sandiganbayan Seventh Division ruled in favor of the motion filed by the Special Prosecutor.In its resolution, the court decided to adhere to Section 13 of R.A. 3019 or the Anti- Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, which calls for the suspension of any public officer who is facing criminal prosecution.“Once the information is found to be sufficient in form and substance, then the Court must issue the order of suspension as a matter of course.

"In an online world populated by social media trolls peddling fake news, Vice President Leni Robredo wants to fight back by mobilizing an “army of truth seekers.”“This is the perfect time to start a campaign against lies and alternative facts,” she told a forum on social media organized by the Coalition for Better Education at the Cebu Eastern College.“Let’s gather together an army of truth seekers, because though there are many trolls, I think there are more people who want the truth,” Robredo said in a mix of English and Filipino.In her speech, a transcript of which was sent to Manila reporters, the former Camarines Sur representative lamented the proliferation of people spreading lies and misinformation on Facebook, Twitter and alternative news blogs.She cited her own experiences battling hoaxes and unfounded rumors.Some of these have included speculations of a romantic liaison with a congressman or her being pregnant, as well as her alleged links to groups plotting President Duterte’s downfall, all of which her office has sought to debunk.“At first, we tried to take the high road. We said that ‘since it’s not true, no one will pay attention to it.’ So we tried to ignore the lies going around about myself or my office,” Robredo said.“But in the six months since then, while we were taking the high road, while we were not responding to the lies, it began to seem like the lies were becoming truth. Because people were only reading the lies and couldn’t see the truth,” she said.“So we realized that every time lies, fake news, or alternative facts are shared, they assume the appearance of truth,” she said.“Shall we accept this world? That is what we must answer today… Shall we surrender the truth to those who want to corrupt it? Of course, my answer is we must not,” she said.“The success of our democracy—and the state of our rights and freedoms—will depend on how we protect the truth,” Robredo said.She said the people might feel powerless in the face of an onslaught of falsities and lies on social media. “But we must challenge ourselves to uphold the truth and its essential place in public discourse. We must be unafraid to debunk falsehoods, to counter fallacies, and to expose frauds who deceive our people so brazenly,” she said.She told reporters on Friday she would continue to voice out her stand on issues even if these ran counter to the Duterte administration.Robredo said she believed that the “Naga Leaks” that are supposed to be an explosive expose against her by the website called “We are Collective” was only meant to silence her.“On our part, we are ready. We have nothing to hide. We have not sinned against the country. We will continue to express our beliefs, with all our hearts and with courage no matter what they will do to stop us,” she said in Filipino.On Saturday, Robredo is scheduled to hold a dialogue with fisherfolk in San Remegio town, Cebu, and grace the relaunching of her late husband’s book, “Jesse Robredo: The Quest for Good Governance,” at Ayala Center Cebu.Robredo said her hopes are high that the death penalty bill would still be overturned by the Senate.She said the reimposition of the death penalty is not an assurance that crime incidence would go down as there is no emperical data that it is a deterrence to crime.Robredo also pointed out that the country had an “imperfect” criminal justice system which raises the possibility that the innocent may be wrongly judged as guilty.It is also antipoor because those on death row are indigents who could not afford a good lawyer, she said.",1
"Politics is not politics without scandals. This scandal is about what appears to be a short-lived affair between Carly Fiorina and Ted Cruz, Republican presidential candidates both.No, it’s not what you’re thinking. No romance is involved — at least none that we know of.Rather, it is an unusual $500,000 donation made by one of Cruz’s super PACs to Fiorina’s campaign.Even the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has no clue on why the donation was made by Cruz to a rival candidate. The super PAC was vague about the donation, describing it on its FEC filing as “other disbursement.” So, the FEC sent a letter to the super PAC asking for a statement or description of the disbursement.Many questions remain unanswered. Does the donation mean that Cruz, if chosen the party’s nominee for president, will pick Fiorina for his vice presidential running mate? But what about if Fiorina wins the nomination? Will Cruz ask for a payback by being named Fiorina’s VP?But then again, it might just be a gentlemanly gesture by Cruz in appreciation for the efforts of the lone woman candidate in a field of 37 Republican presidential candidates. Chivalry may, after all, still be alive.",0
"“Today, we are all Parisians.”The French Embassy in Manila said this Saturday in response to the “heartfelt expressions of support” for France from the Filipino people, led by President Benigno Aquino III, in condemning the deadly terror attacks in the French capital late Friday.“We are deeply touched by the heartfelt expressions of support in the Philippines extended by President Benigno S. Aquino III, the national and local authorities, the people of the Philippines, and all those from foreign embassies and groups who have been expressing their sympathy to the French people,” the embassy said.“France will always fight against extremism and stand for the values of democracy and human rights enshrined in our national motto ‘Liberte, egalite, fraternity,’ which was coined in Paris centuries ago,” it said.READ: DFA: No Filipinos hurt so far in Paris attacks‘Sadness and in shock’Asked if the terrorist attacks would deter Mr. Aquino from attending the climate change conference in Paris next month, Valte said that even before the attacks, the President’s attendance had yet to be confirmed.“We join the whole world in sadness and in shock,” said Manila Archbishop Luis Cardinal Antonio Tagle.“We cannot isolate ourselves from what is happening from the different parts of the world. The constant violence and battles, and this morning, the news of what happened in Paris,” Tagle said at a Mass to mark the end of the three-day Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines-Basic Ecclesial Communities National Assembly at Cuneta Astrodome on Saturday.“Let us unite ourselves to the many people suffering and victims of violence. We pray for their families,” he said.“As we join the world in mourning and grieving and in sorrow, our gathering is a sign of hope,” he added.House Speaker Sonny Belmonte said the Paris attacks should be a warning to security officials that the Islamic State problem is global.Sen. Sonny Angara, on his Twitter account, called for vigilance and joined calls to pray for Paris “because it could have easily been Manila, Tokyo or any other big city.”“Peace and freedom-loving peoples and governments everywhere should unite to fight this type of terror and indiscriminate violent attacks. This has no place in the modern world. We should all help and create a more peaceful and secure world,”Angara said in a separate text message.Sen. Ferdinand Marcos described the Paris attacks as “barbaric” and said it was “unacceptable and unforgivable.”“We stand shoulder to shoulder with the Parisienne and the entire French nation and condemn this terror inflicted upon innocents. We are with them in this fight against terror and extremism in the world,” Marcos said in a statement.The attacks serve as an unfortunate reminder that no free country and people are safe from terrorism, according to Sen. Gregorio Honasan.“It is a painful wake-up call that terrorist attacks can happen to anyone, anywhere,” Honasan said in a statement.On Twitter, Sen. Loren Legarda said she sympathizes with the victims of the “vicious” Paris attacks, and called for vigilance against terrorism.Sen. Pia Cayetano called for prayers and support for the people of France, while Sen. JV Ejercito said the attacks were “brutal” and “inhuman.”“In a statement, Vice President Jejomar Binay expressed solidarity with France, while calling on the country’s security agencies to be on their toes and urging the public to be vigilant to deter acts of terror here at home.

"Today, the 43rd anniversary of the day Ferdinand Marcos signed his martial law decree, Malacañang joins Filipinos in honoring the sacrifices of the victims of martial rule, calling it “one of the darkest chapters in the country’s history.”In a statement on state-run Radyo ng Bayan, Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma recalled that “(Filipinos) defied harassment, cruel punishment and fear as they … fought for human rights at a time when the dictatorship demolished the house of democracy in our land.”“From their blood, sweat and tears, our people rebuilt their will power and strength to mount wave upon wave of protests that culminated in the triumph of the Edsa People Power Revolution in 1986,” he said.Coloma emphasized that “the people’s struggle against martial rule served as the foundation for rebuilding democracy in the Philippines.” That, he said, “served as a beacon of hope and inspiration for other freedom-loving people, who overcame dictatorship and rebuilt democracy in their land.”Citing the Aquino administration’s efforts to “ensure sustainable long-term growth and stability that would include the participation of all Filipinos,” Coloma stressed the need to “impart to the youth the lessons learned from martial rule and the struggle to restore democracy as our legacy to future generations.”Earlier, the Palace disputed Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s claim that life was better when his father was in power.Coloma urged the senator to look at the names on Bantayog ng mga Bayani in Quezon City to know what it was like during his father’s dictatorial regime.He was referring to the Wall of Remembrance at the shrine. The names of the first 65 martyrs of martial law, led by Sen. Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr., the father of President Aquino, are inscribed on the wall.Coloma said it would be better for the younger Marcos to ask the families of those killed during the martial law about the dictatorship, adding the senator was probably misinformed.Presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda earlier said there was no truth to statements that life was better during the martial law years.“That is an illusion,” Lacierda said. “Filipinos not only suffered human rights abuses but also economic abuses.”He added: “There were human rights abuses. People were tortured.”He said the President would not allow a hero’s burial for Marcos and that “the position of President Aquino remains the same.”RELATED STORIESSa kabataang di nakatikim ng Martial Law, ito ang ginawa ni MarcosDepEd sets new directions on teaching martial law era",1
"With a clenched fist symbolic of the campaign of Philippine presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte, Democratic presidential aspirant Senator Bernie Sanders today endorsed the controversial mayor of Davao City.This is the first time in the history of the United States that a Philippine presidential candidate has received the endorsement of both American political parties. Earlier, Republican Donald Trump gave his thumbs up for Duterte to become the next president of the United States.In an impassioned speech delivered in his home state, Sanders likened himself to Duterte, saying that both of them have launched a “revolution” against the Establishment and against politics as usual.In his campaign speeches, Duterte did not hold back in saying that he will establish a revolutionary government if congress gets in the way of his reforms.The foul-mouthed, tough-talking mayor leads all national polls and is expected to emerge victorious when the Filipino people cast their votes in tomorrow’s presidential elections.Birds of the same feather stick together, even if one bird has a slightly different feather (Trump).",0
" While some eagerly await each episode, officials of Arayat town here in Pampanga province aren’t big fans of “Ang Probinsyano.”The reason: The TV series, topbilled by their provincemate Coco Martin, has supposedly cast the town by the serene Mt. Arayat in a bad light.ResolutionAlthough the producers have removed any references to Mount Arayat, town officials on Friday forwarded a resolution to the Pampanga provincial board condemning the ABS-CBN network for depicting Arayat town “as a haven and breeding ground for terrorists and hoodlums.”Their resolution airs a “call for a hearing and to make ABS-CBN apologize for the wrong impressions it created and to correct these [in the long-running telenovela],” said Arayat Mayor Emmanuel Alejandrino.No intentionABS-CBN said the series had no intention to portray the town “negatively.”It said that a disclaimer was issued at the beginning of the show every night from Monday to Saturday, saying the characters, incidents and organizations depicted there were purely fictitious and bore no resemblance to actual people and events.Latest plot dev’tBut Alejandrino argued that the show portrayed a “true place in a town and province.”The latest plot development involves a faction of a rebel group conspiring with crooked government officials to sow fear by terrorism.Alejandrino said the insurgency theme was a sensitive topic in Arayat, which used to be a bastion for socialist and communist movements from the pre-World War II years up to the 1990s.ApologyABS-CBN said the storyline involving the “Pulang Araw” rebels ended on July 18.The program “made no reference to the people of Arayat as rebels, nor was there any scene that was shot in Arayat,” it said.“We apologize if the story has offended and caused distress to the local government and the people of Arayat. We recognize the importance of ecotourism to Arayat and would not want to do anything to harm its image and reputation,” it added.Key rolesPampanga natives play key roles in the series: Martin as the crime-fighting SPO2 Ricardo Dalisay and former Sen. Manuel “Lito” Lapid as a rebel commander.It is not known if they have made any stand regarding how their home province has been characterized in the show.The resolution, sponsored by Councilor Ferdinand Kabigting, describes Arayat town as a “wholesome and peaceful community.”Worry-free livesIt says the Arayat people enjoy “worry-free lives,” and have not been concerned about “terrorist attacks.”Mount Arayat, the council says, is the town’s “crown jewel of ecotourism [so its] protection and promotion are Arayat’s No. 1 priorities.”Online commentaries, however, rebuked the Arayat officials for “overreacting.”",1
"Two days into the new year, holiday injuries continue to rise as the health department and the police receive reports of firecracker- and stray bullet-related incidents.As of 6 a.m. on Friday, injuries caused by firecracker use stood at 455, the Department of Health’s (DOH) epidemiology bureau said in its “Aksyon: Paputok Injury Reduction 2015” report.Another four injuries were caused by stray bullets, from people shooting guns into the air to celebrate the festive season, it said.The figures from the Philippine National Police were slightly different from those of the health department, however.“The PNP reported a total of 194 injuries from Dec. 16, 2015, to Jan. 2, 158 firecracker-related and 36 from stray bullets. It also reported only 31 stray-bullet incidents on Friday which injured 27 people.”But both agencies still placed the fatality from the New Year’s Eve celebrations at 1, the drunken Manila resident who hugged a big firecracker after lighting it.No fatality has so far been reported from stray bullets, the PNP said.Small but terrible“Piccolo,” a tiny, cheap but powerful firecracker, remains to be the leading cause of most of the reported firecracker injuries.Of the total number of cases reported, 245, or 54 percent, were caused by piccolo.Sixty-two percent, or 280 of the cases reported, involved children less than 14 years old.In the 2014 holiday revelry, 32 percent of firecracker injuries were caused by the piccolo; in 2013, it was 36 percent and in 2012, 26 percent.The DOH earlier urged the police and local governments to strictly enforce the law against the sale of piccolo during the holidays to significantly bring down the number of firecracker injuries.Health Secretary Janette Garin earlier said the Bureau of Customs (BOC) must find out in what form piccolo enters the country. She also proposed that the bureau begin stringent scrutiny of cargoes earlier in the year to thwart attempts to smuggle illegal firecrackers, particularly piccolo.In its report, the health department said the current figure on firecracker injuries—recorded beginning Dec. 2",1
"The political and personal ties between Vice President Jejomar Binay and former Sen. Aquilino “Nene” Pimentel Jr. spanned over three decades, starting when they were members of the Movement of Attorneys for Brotherhood and Integrity Inc. (Mabini), a group of human rights lawyers founded in 1980 to fight the dictatorship of then President Ferdinand Marcos.Days after Marcos was toppled from power in the Edsa People Power Revolution in 1986, then President Corazon Aquino appointed Binay officer in charge and later acting mayor of the then town of Makati through Pimentel, who was then the local government secretary.Binay and Pimentel were also members of the PDP-Laban, a merger between two political parties—the Partido ng Demokratikong Pilipino (PDP) and Lakas ng Bayan (Laban), established in the late 1970s by the then imprisoned Sen. Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr.But the cracks began to show when the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA), a coalition of Binay’s PDP-Laban and Joseph Estrada’s Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino, put former Bukidnon Rep. Miguel Zubiri on its 2013 senatorial slate.Nene’s son, Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, had accused Zubiri of robbing him of a Senate seat in the fraud-marred 2007 senatorial election.In November 2011, the Commission on Elections and the Department of Justice charged former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, former Maguindanao Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr. and former Comelec election officer Lintang Bedol with electoral fraud involving the 2007 elections in Maguindanao province. They allegedly conspired to ensure a 12-0 win for administration candidates, including Zubiri.Zubiri was proclaimed the winner of the 12th Senate seat at stake in the election, but quit inAugust 2011 after Bedol admitted the fraud. Koko Pimentel, who placed 13th and filed an electoral protest against him, served the remainder of Zubiri’s term.Koko Pimentel, running as an administration candidate, won a fresh term in the 2013 elections.The elder Pimentel first left the University of Makati (UMak), the city government-run university, after Binay broke his ties with PDP-Laban over political differences in 2014.Nene agreed to return after Binay implored him not to allow politics to get in the way of his good programs at the university.Binay said he found it odd that Koko, the party president, was allied with the administration, while his daughter, Sen. Nancy Binay, belonged to the opposition.In September 2014, Pimentel finally vacated his post as lecturer and head of the Center for Local Governance at UMak, when the Senate began its inquiry into the charges of corruption and ill-gotten wealth against Binay.Koko Pimentel is the chair of the Senate blue ribbon subcommittee that held more than a dozen hearings on allegations linking Binay to corruption in Makati City when he was its mayor.“I thought that the situation called for my getting out. Otherwise, either way, if the investigation results in the acquittal, or cleansing of Jojo [Binay], people might think, even if it’s not true, that the reason for that is that his [Koko’s] father is there,” Nene said.“On the other hand, if convicted, the other side, those partisan to Jojo, would say: ‘What is he doing there? He’s there, and he’s done nothing.’ So either way, it doesn’t look good,” he added.Since then, Nene said he and Binay had never talked, except once.In October 2014, they were invited to the same forum on local government at a Davao City hotel, and Binay sought Pimentel out, going up to his room for a chat.“We said, ‘How are you?’ We talked about very noncontroversial topics. I just told him, ‘I wish you well and I hope the truth will come out to vindicate everyone if that’s possible,’” Pimentel said. Inquirer Research",1
"The Department of Transportation (DoTr) has announced that the state-run Philippine National Railways will raise fares starting July 1, the first increase in 20 years.The existing minimum fare of P10 will go up to P15, according to the DoTr. Fare structure will be adjusted from P0.71 per kilometer to P1.07 per kilometer.“We are only implementing a fare increase that has been long delayed for more than 20 years,” PNR General Manager Junn Magno said in a text message sent to reporters over the weekend.“The fare increase now is expected to raise additional revenue for the maintenance of [the state agency’s] existing rolling stock, tracks and operating stations,” according to PNR.The decision was based on a December 2014 PNR board resolution stating that there has to be a fare hike as the PNR, the oldest existing train system in the Philippines, has already “become financially uncompetitive compared to bus, jeepney and LRT [Light Tail Transit] fares, per kilometer.”The PNR currently connects Tutuban station in Manila to Mamatid station in Laguna province, south of Manila.REICELENE JOY N.

"The Senate Committee on Finance on Monday grilled the Department of Education (DepEd) over an unspent budget of P21.5 billion last year as it weighed in on the agency’s capacity to fully spend its proposed P613.1 billion budget for 2018.At the hearing, finance committee chair Sen. Loren Legarda asked the agency to submit a memo listing the programs and infrastructures that were affected when the money was reverted to unappropriated surplus of the government’s general fund and specifying the reasons for incurring such amount.“Before we even talk about giving you a new budget, we want to know why you returned P21.5 billion. Last week, we were very disappointed, saddened by the Department of Transportation returning P11.5 billion. Now we see DepEd returning P21.5 billion,” said Legarda.Unserved“When we return funds to the Treasury, that means there are people unserved, there are classrooms not rehabilitated, there are books not printed and there are children not helped,” she said.The DepEd broke down the P21.5 billion as the following: P12 billion for teacher positions; P5 billion for the Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education (Gastpe); P1.3 billion for the provision and maintenance of basic education facilities, P1 billion for technical-vocational supplies and P3.6 billion for the provision of textbooks and instructional materials.The P21.5 billion were 2015 allocations that were carried over last year.Education Secretary Leonor Briones told the panel that the agency had difficulty keeping up with its backlog in 2015 as it was also catching up with the utilization of its 2016 budget.“Now we are catching up with 2017 and we can only do it in phases,” said Briones, noting that the agency has introduced reforms, restructured its management system and tightened its cooperation with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to address classroom backlogs.The DepEd also said the DPWH had a remaining balance of P76 billion or 70 percent of the P109 billion in the 2017 budget to be obligated for the construction of classrooms before December 2017. Legarda wondered if it could be done in a span of three months.“If the DepEd is having hard time with the two-year cycle, now it’s a 12-month cycle. I’m really just worried that you may not be able to spend all. So I am asking you to do an internal housekeeping,” said Legarda.",1

He is, he is, he is (out of this).Thus, it’s as clear as day that the PTFoMS issued a statement despite Andanar having the sole authority to issue such.TP: Saan po bang part ng Administrative Order 1 nag-a-allow ng exceptions to the rule (na si Sec. Martin lang ang puwedeng mag-issue ng mga statements? You see, mainstream media has been screaming, “Rule of Law! Rule of Law!” for the past year, and this is what the Rule of Law dictates. So gusto ko lang po… kailangan ko lang ang enabling law which allows that body to bypass AO 1, to bypass the orders of the President.Egco: We did not actually bypass SMMA (Andanar)… Of course, andoon ang chair, andoon ang lahat, everybody there, making the policy kasi e… kumbaga, kung ako masusunod, RJ, of course, ayokong mag-release ng kung anu-ano.Statement released despite Andanar’s absence TP: So bakit niyo ni-release?Egco: Iyon kasi ang decision ng body.TP: Sabihin na natin na powerless kayo sa decision (ng PTFoMS as a whole)… If were to sue someone for violating the Revised Penal Code, should I be suing you, or should I be suing them?Egco: E I think it’s the decision of the Task Force kasi… Ganito kasi, pag nakita mo yung mga statements ko before, may reference yon if it was my own statement, na ipapaalam ko kay Secretary. TP: Ang issue ko dito, did we follow the law in the issuance of this statement? Kasi we can argue all day about what’s ethical and what’s not e kaya lang, magde-deadlock lang tayo don. So the question boils down to who violated what (law).Egco: Sa issuance non, dahil decision nga yon ng entire body…TP: O sige sir, I think I’ve heard your side and I’ll take your word for what it is, and I’ll just do what I can do from my end. Kasi sir, social media publishers are not very happy with what he task force did. So.. ehh.. ganun talaga.Egco: We will issue a clarificatory ano…TP: Naku sir, e kumonsulta ka muna kay Sec. Martin… magtu-two counts ka ng (Usurpation of Authority).Egco and SMO laughed.TP: E totoo di ba? Magtu-two counts ka.To clarify the issue, I have lodged an eFoI request for documents revising Administrative Order No. 1 Section 5 [ eFoI ]. In the request's description, I specifically said:I would like to request for any document issued after the October 2016 issuance of Administrative Order No. 1 that effectively amends AO 1 Sec. 5, or the clause that reserves solely to the PCOO Secretary the authority to issue non-administrative public statements on behalf of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security (PTFoMS).I would like to know if there are any subsequently-issued law or regulation that enables anyone other than the PCOO Sec. to serve as PTFoMS spokesperson or to execute all or part of the PTFoMS spokesperson's responsibilities as detailed in AO 1 Sec 5.FoI request for documents revising of AO 1 Sec 5The Legal Issues Before I cite potential violations of existing laws, let me state for the record that Egco’s ignorance of Administrative Order No. 1, the exact same document that created his position, is alarming. Should we entrust media security to someone who does not have a clear understanding of what his Executive Director position entails, of what he can and cannot do?President Duterte, please rethink this particular appointment.Now, let’s move on to the legal issues. I consulted with my lawyer-friends to analyze the situation, and this is what we have come up with, so far. Note that his is not an exhaustive list of possible violations, but a mere preview of what may happen should anyone pursue legal remedies.Also note that I have lodged an FoI request for the resolutions issued during the meetings related to the controversial TPFoMS press statement. I also requested for the attendance during those meetings and if possible, the minutes of the meeting that are relevant to the issue at hand [ eFoI ].FoI request for PTFoMS documentsSo now, let’s go.1: Grave Abuse of Discretion The hastily issued PTFoMS’ press statement, in consideration of the surrounding circumstances and the mention of my name in the NUJP complaint from which it was based, is clearly a violation of my constitutional right to due process, a right that every veteran journalist, like Usec and former National Press Club president Egco, should be totally aware of.As PTFoMS’ executive director, Egco’s tasks include ensuring that all applicable laws, rules, and regulations are followed in everything that PTFoMS does, and that includes ensuring that I, along with all the social media users referred to by the NUJP complaint, be given the benefit of due process.Egco willfully neglected to even attempt to conduct an investigation into the complaint. Egco willfully decided not to raise this issue during the PTFoMS meeting and thus allowed the PTFoMS to issue a blanket indictment of social media users for an accusation with no supporting evidence.Egco did not even bother to contact me – or anyone else in Social Media – for the other side of the issue, effectively abridging our right to Free Speech.This amounts to the administrative violation of Grave Abuse of Discretion [ The hastily issued PTFoMS’ press statement, in consideration of the surrounding circumstances and the mention of my name in the NUJP complaint from which it was based, is clearly a violation of my constitutional right to due process, a right that every veteran journalist, like Usec and former National Press Club president Egco, should be totally aware of.As PTFoMS’ executive director, Egco’s tasks include ensuring that all applicable laws, rules, and regulations are followed in everything that PTFoMS does, and that includes ensuring that I, along with all the social media users referred to by the NUJP complaint, be given the benefit of due process.Egco willfully neglected to even attempt to conduct an investigation into the complaint.

Egco allowed the illegal issuance of the PTFoMS press statement, in violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-graft and Corrupt Practices Act [“Causing any undue injury to any party… in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence…” The issuance of the illegal press statement is meant as an attempt not only to intimidate me and other social media users, but also to cause injury to my reputation when Egco, as the Executive Director of the PTFoMS, demonstrated manifest partiality in favor of the Big Media complainants.Why manifest partiality?Because social media publishers, by all means, are also media workers. Thus, it is within the PTFoMS’ mandate to protect social media publishers like me, just like how it protects mainstream journalists. Despite this, Egco decided to side with Big Media, to the detriment of social media publishers like ThinkingPinoy.I am an independent blogger. But just like mainstream journalists from Big Media, my success relies heavily on the goodwill of people, i.e. my reputation.Unfortunately, the complainant NUJP, along with Big Media in general, possibly out of insecurity arising from its dwindling influence, has been attacking the reputation of independent publishers like me, as evidenced by NUJP’s injudicious and capricious use of the term “fake news” to refer to the work of independent publishers.Thus, a rift exists between Big Media, where NUJP belongs, and Independent Media, where I and many other social media publishers identify with. And in this case, Egco demonstrated manifest partiality in favor of the former.The illegally-issued PTFoMS, in consideration of the surrounding circumstances, caused injury to my reputation. i.e. injury to property, as it has been argued that by legal scholars that reputation may be considered property in virtual economies [Relevant clauses of RA 3019 provides the penalty of imprisonment for 6-15 years and perpetual disqualification from public office for this violation.3: Usurpation of Authority or Official Functions Despite this, Usec. Egco allowed the illegal issuance of the PTFoMS press statement, in violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-graft and Corrupt Practices Act [ RA 3019 ], the relevant part of which reads:The issuance of the illegal press statement is meant as an attempt not only to intimidate me and other social media users, but also to cause injury to my reputation when Egco, as the Executive Director of the PTFoMS, demonstrated manifest partiality in favor of the Big Media complainants.Why manifest partiality?Because social media publishers, by all means, are also media workers.

There is no enabling law that allows him to do so. Thus, Egco may have been violated RPC Art 177 multiple times even before this brouhaha happened.In line with this, I have lodged a Freedom of Information request for the list of all public statements issued by Usec.

"chanting of the Sacred Passion of Jesus Christ – at the Our Lady of Victories Church (OLVC) in Quezon City might seem nothing more than the usual; since such is the tradition at Catholic parishes all over the country during Holy Week.But for members of this parish, this pabasa is special for two reasons – it is the first time they are ever holding one as previous parish priests were foreigners; and secondly, it is timed with the exposition of first-class relics from Christ’s Sacred Passion.Fr. Carlo Magno Saa, OLVC parish priest, explained that his predecessors were all foreigners, so the parish never held its own pabasa.“We have done nothing new, we are just reviving what was supposed to be done as Catholics,” he said.The revival of the traditional pabasa in his parish is important, Saa said, because it has to be conserved and passed on to the next generation.‘Priceless relics’In front of the group of parishioners chanting the pabasa are two crosses containing the first class relics of the passion of Jesus Christ – a piece of the Holy Cross, Crown of Thorns, Column of Flagellation, and Sepulcher Stone. Each measuring no longer than an inch.First class relics are items directly related in the events of the life of Jesus. Saa said he received the relics in 1998 after the late former San Fernando, La Union Bishop Salvador Lazo gave him the authorization to receive them.“When I was still a pre-seminarian way back 1995, I met Fr. Lazo. Then, for two years, I studied Philosophy in Australia. I was then asked by our superior to go to our mother house in Switzerland. That was when Fr. Lazo visited me,” Saa recounted.It was then that the late bishop gave him a letter authorizing him to receive relics from Christ’s Passion in Rome. The process, he said, did not take too long.“The relics came from the Augustinian sisters of Monasterio de Sta. Lucia in Rome. ’Yung mga madre dun, karamihan ay Pinay kaya nung nakita rin nila na dala-dala ko ang isang sulat na galing din sa Pinoy na Obispo, natuwa rin sila kaya ibinigay sa akin ang mga relics na ‘yan, (Most of the nuns there are Filipinos so when they learned that I have an authorization from a fellow Filipino, they were very happy to give the relics to me,)” he said.Saa said that one cannot buy relics and that it can only be received upon the authorization of a Bishop.“Relics are priceless; it can never be bought,” he said.Jesus is realSaa said the relics lead Christians back to the very beginning of Christianity.“Since they are first class relics, they are not just a symbolism. It leads us back that Jesus is not just in the imagination; He was a historical person like us,” he said.For the parish priest, the relics give some sort of consolation for the suffering of mankind because “even Christ who was innocent took himself to sanctify and give us courage.”“It becomes a door to a happy eternity kapag kagaya ni Kristo ay pinasan natin ang ating cross,” he said. “If I look at the little particle of the cross masasabi ko na I can transform whatever suffering, whatever pain na nararanasan ko.”",1
"Summertime visitors to the beaches of Pangasinan were warned yesterday by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) against collecting and eating shellfish in some areas with red tide.The BFAR said shellfish samples collected in the coastal areas of Bolinao and Anda have been found positive of the red tide toxin.Based on the latest laboratory tests, the toxin level in shellfish samples collected in Bolinao and Anda are between 78-90ngSTX which the BFAR said is very high.Once eaten, shellfish meat from these red tide-affected areas may lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) that may cause a person’s sudden death.The BFAR clarified that except for Bolinao and Anda, other coastal areas of the province only have a low toxicity level and that shellfish like crabs and mussels as well as shrimps and prawns are fit for human consumption especially if they are cooked.",1
"The Bureau of Immigration will assign more employees to the airports to deal with a staff shortage caused by mass resignations and leaves of absence involving immigration officers.President Duterte’s order to stop payment for overtime work has led to the departures, according to Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II.Malacañang said on Tuesday that a solution to the staff shortage at airport immigration counters had already been worked out, but the bureau had yet to carry it out.Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said that as early as January, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), Department of Justice and the immigration bureau agreed to add more positions in the bureau so that current employees need not render too much overtime work.Overtime pay stoppedThe President has barred the immigration bureau from using airport express lane funds for overtime pay.The bureau is appealing Mr. Duterte’s order.The loss of overtime pay has forced poorly paid immigration officers to resign or go on leave to look for new jobs.Aguirre said on Monday that 32 immigration officers had resigned and 50 more had filed for leaves of up to six months to go job-hunting.He said more 3,000 immigration employees had been on leave as of Feb. 17 following the suspension of overtime payments.Abella said the DBM had approved 49 positions for the immigration bureau’s financial and management division and administrative division, and 887 positions for additional immigration officers and assistants.The new positions will increase by 74 percent the number of immigration officers and immigration assistants, he said. The increase in staff would reduce the need for the current employees to render overtime work, he added.But the positions have yet to be filled, and the current employees prefer overtime work, he said.“In other words, the whole argument of the DBM is that they did act and they did add. Now, the onus, the burden of response is now upon the [immigration] officials. They have not accepted it. They choose to stick to their guns about overtime pay,” Abella said.Had the immigration bureau filled the positions, there would be shorter lines at the airports, he said.“It’s as simple as that. In a sense, it’s almost a household accounting job,” he said.Abella said the immigration staff shortage at the airports was a short-term problem, to be felt mostly during Holy Week, a peak travel period.To ease the situation the immigration bureau is assigning more employees to the airports.Contingency planImmigration Commissioner Jaime Morente ordered the deployment of 171 immigration officers during Holy Week, said Antonette Mangrobang, spokesperson for the bureau.The contingency plan takes effect on April 9, Palm Sunday, and through Holy Week in anticipation of heavy passenger traffic at airports, she said.Of the 171 immigration officers, 150 will be assigned to Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) and the rest to immigration counters at international airports in Cebu, Davao and Iloilo, she said.The augmentation force will be composed of division, section and unit chiefs, immigration officers from the bureau’s main office in Intramuros and subports, and other employees.Although Naia is the only airport affected by resignations and leaves, the immigration bureau is preparing for a spike in passenger traffic in other international airports.Mangrobang said all available employees, such as administrative staff and supervisors, were ordered to render counter duty in addition to their regular work as part of the bureau’s manpower augmentation measures.“These are immigration officers, intelligence officers, so they are also very familiar with the operations at the airport,” she said.“I myself will be rendering counter duty at the airport on Maundy Thursday,” she added.Mangrobang said the Immigration Officers Association of the Philippines had reiterated its appeal to its members to report for duty.She gave assurance that the immigration bureau was doing everything to ease the staff shortage at Naia.Records at the bureau showed that the agency has more than 2,000 employees. The bureau needs more to meet the ideal staff force of 4,000.",1
"The Commission on Elections (Comelec) will not consider shopping malls owned by or identified with politicians as possible polling places in the 2016 elections.Comelec Chair Andres Bautista gave the assurance on Friday, saying the Comelec wanted to avoid conflict of interest in the plan to set up polling precincts at shopping malls for voters’ convenience.“We cannot use Gateway Mall or other Araneta malls since [Interior] Secretary Mar Roxas is a possible candidate. We also cannot use Starmalls because it’s owned by the Villars, Sen. Cynthia Villar,” Bautista said in an interview on the sidelines of the satellite registration at SM Aura in Taguig City.“That’s against the law. We cannot use private establishments owned by or those who support possible candidates or political parties,” Bautista said.Roxas is the presumptive presidential candidate of the ruling Liberal Party while Villar is the wife of Nacionalista Party President Manuel Villar, who is also a former Senate President.Roxas’ family owns Gateway Mall, Ali Mall and Farmers Plaza in Cubao, Quezon City.The Villars own the Starmalls chain.The law allows itSection 42 of the Omnibus Election Code provides that in case there is no public school or other public building that can be used, other appropriate private buildings may be designated as polling places.But the law states that such private buildings must not be “owned or occupied or possessed by any incumbent elective public official or candidate, or his relative within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity.”Bautista said the Comelec did not want to politicize the conduct of voting at shopping malls in the 2016 polls.“We want to ensure that our registration and voting will not be tainted with politics,” he said.Bautista said the Comelec remained committed to exploring the legality and feasibility of setting up polling precincts at shopping malls.“We are looking for other ways to expedite or make the voting process easier and more convenient for the voters. We want more Filipinos to vote because it strengthens our democracy,” he said.Bautista said the Comelec was encouraged by the interest shown by two big shopping mall operators, Robinson’s Malls and SM Supermalls, in the 2016 plan.SM Supermalls reportedly has agreed to allow 52 of its shopping malls as voting centers. Robinson’s also reportedly agreed to allow 42 of its shopping malls to be used by the Comelec during the elections.He said the Comelec was also asking other shopping mall operators to participate in the endeavor.Retailers’ group agreesThe Philippine Retailers Association (PRA) has expressed full support for the Comelec plan.In a telephone interview yesterday, PRA vice chair Roberto Claudio Sr. said the PRA, which groups 80 percent of shopping malls in the country, was willing to help the Comelec and would convince other shopping malls to join the project.“We are supporting [Comelec Chair Andres Bautista] and endorsing his proposal to use shopping malls as voting centers in the coming elections. We feel this is a good move to make it more convenient and comfortable for voters, especially for the voting areas that are congested. Conducting the voting in shopping malls will be more convenient,” Claudio said.“In terms of security for voters, the dangers of crime-related activities will be minimized or avoided as shopping malls are secured by many guards. In terms of security of the election process, that will all depend on how prepared the Comelec will be in terms of manpower. They will need to deploy the teachers and equipment in the shopping malls and make the necessary preparations to ensure that voting is properly done and any irregularities will be avoided,” he said.Claudio said PRA members were looking at not only allocating space for polling precincts but also providing assistance in terms of logistical requirements to ensure proper deployment during the balloting.“We’re trying to coordinate with members to see what other possible assistance we can give. We can help in the logistical requirements or in getting sponsors for instance to feed the Comelec people, the teachers and other volunteers at the voting centers,” he said.SkepticalSome sectors appear skeptical about the proposal, though.While the plan is a “creative and innovative” way to reach out to voters, there are other factors that the Comelec should consider, such as public perception and legality, according to the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV).“We are not totally against it. We just need to study the issues,” the PPCRV said.RELATED STORIESOnline registration for PH overseas voters rolled out worldwideSeniors, PWDs can shop, register to vote in malls on Friday",1
"ALTHOUGH it has weakened into a low pressure area, “Lando” is the most destructive typhoon to hit the country so far this year, leaving behind more than P7.3 billion in damage to agriculture and infrastructure, and at least 41 lives lost.“So far, for this year, Lando is the worst in terms of the casualties and the damage it caused. We hope this will be the last,” said Romina Marasigan, spokesperson of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC.)Lando (international name: Koppu) was the 12th storm to batter the Philippines this year. When it first struck the east coast of Luzon on Sunday morning, its gusts reached 210 kilometers an hour, making it the second strongest storm to hit the country this year.As of Thursday afternoon, the low pressure area was spotted 240 km east of Basco, Batanes.Of the damage recorded all over Luzon, P6.43 billion was accounted for by agricultural crops and P902.39 million by infrastructure.So far, the agency has confirmed 41 deaths in Luzon, 78 injured and five still missing.In its update on Thursday, the NDRRMC said the typhoon affected 1,242,239 persons in the Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Bicol, Metro Manila and the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR).Of the affected people, 113,584 are still in 455 evacuation centers.So far, local authorities, the Department of Social Welfare and Development and nongovernment units have given P23.21 million worth of assistance to the affected families.Blackout, floodingProvince-wide power outages remain in the provinces of Ilocos Sur, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Aurora, Quezon, Kalinga and Mountain Province, as well as five cities and 86 towns.Sixteen passengers, three motorized bancas, and four rolling cargoes are still stranded because of rough seas.Since hitting land on Sunday, the NDRRMC has monitored 765 flooding incidents in the provinces of Pangasinan, Isabela, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Bulacan, Pampanga, Zambales, Cagayan and Benguet.Floods and landslides caused 101 roads and 11 bridges in northern and Central Luzon to be impassable, while 18,758 houses were damaged.The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) placed Lando’s damage to national roads, bridges and flood control facilities in five Luzon regions at P927.71 million.In a report, DPWH Bureau of Maintenance Thursday said that damage to flood control projects alone amounted to P435.56 million.Central Luzon topped the list with damage reaching P448.96 million, including more than P218 million worth of flood control facilities and P145 million in damaged bridges.Region III was followed by CAR with P209.24 million; Cagayan Valley, P201.63 million; Ilocos, P67.35 million and Bicol, P520,000.The DPWH also reported that as of Thursday morning, sections of 39 national roads in northern and Central Luzon remained closed to vehicular traffic due to landslides, floods, sunken roadways and fallen electric posts, trees and other debris.Twenty-five of these roads are in CAR while the remaining 14 are in Central Luzon.The closed thoroughfares include Kennon Road and three other roads in Baguio City—Legarda Road, Western Link Circumferential Road and Military Fort Road.Also impassable to all types of vehicles are eight roads in Benguet province; five in Tarlac; four each in Kalinga and Pampanga; three in Mountain Province; two each in Abra, Apayao, Ifugao, Bulacan and Nueva Ecija; and one in Aurora.Dalton Pass now openThe DPWH office in Cagayan Valley said the landslide-prone Dalton Pass in Nueva Vizcaya had been cleared and opened to two-way traffic on Wednesday morning.DPWH Director Nerie Bueno in Cagayan Valley told the Inquirer that the regional office had “prepositioned road-clearing equipment and field personnel who will promptly respond to rescue and clearing operations along national highways and bridges in the region.”Contacted by phone, Bueno recalled that on Oct. 19 evening, “massive landslides took place in Barangay (Village) Villa Flores in Sta. Fe, Nueva Vizcaya, causing road closure and traffic buildup.”However, the “road sections were promptly [cleared] and opened to traffic at 8:30 a.m. the following day,” she said.Later that day, an undisclosed number of vehicles were stalled in Sta. Fe after three trailer trucks broke down in separate locations in the municipality.“This led some undisciplined motorists to counterflow on both lanes, causing traffic buildup,” said Bueno.The DPWH field staff “coordinated with the provincial government in controlling the situation.” ",1
"Frustrated that Paolo Duterte refused to undress in front of the Senate and on national television to prove his allegation that the Davao City Vice Mayor is a member of the Triad organization, Senator Antonio Trillanes now wants to summon Baste Duterte, Paolo’s brother.At a Senate hearing last week, Trillanes challenged the Vice Mayor to show the tattoo on his back, to which the latter responded, “No way!”“I firmly believe that the Triad membership runs in the family, so if Paolo refuses to show his tattoo, perhaps Baste would be more open to undressing before the Senate,” Trillanes said.As of presstime, Baste has not responded to Trillanes’ summons plan.It’s getting more exciting, folks!",0
"Looking at it from a ground perspective, whenever I look around I see a lot of construction projects going on, giving a false impression that the country is prospering. However most of the construction boom are real estate projects – hotels, condominiums, house and lot, and commercial areas – malls, supermarkets, convenience stores, and so on.But this sort of growth is unsustainable. You can only have so much real estate to meet the demand. What happens when that demand dries up? What happens when people are unable to pay their mortgages? Remittances can't remain constant forever. There would be a lot of empty houses and condos, construction will stop, the economy will contract and there'd be a lot more jobless and homeless people. This will to unrest, and at the worst, upheaval.You don't base an entire economy that creates little and relies on remittances to fund consumer demand for goods made elsewhere. Not to mention the fact that so many people are employed in the informal sector; think fishball vendors, dispatchers, tricycle drivers, ukay-ukays etc.If you want a sustainable economy, give these people jobs in manufacturing. Agriculture is also in such a sorry state here in the Philippines that an average farmer earns not more than Php 23,000 per annum. No wonder the former US ambassador to the Philippines regarded the Philippines a basketcase economy as revealed through diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks.-------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"It was a long chase across the metropolis—and even a longer vigil in the Senate—but in the end the cops caught their quarry: Sen. Leila de Lima.With sirens blaring, a team of Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) policemen raced across Metro Manila on Thursday night to arrest De Lima, the highest-profile critic of President Rodrigo Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, after the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court issued a warrant for her arrest on drug charges.The senator’s camp had reached an agreement that she would not be arrested on Thursday night, but the CIDG was keen on enforcing the court order.“Once we get the warrant, we will proceed with the arrest. But first, have your dinner,” CIDG Director Roel Obusan told reporters staked out at the CIDG-National Capital Region office in Camp Crame in Quezon City.Arresting teamAt that time, De Lima had let it be known from the Senate that she was going home to see her family.But at the CIDG-NCR office, officers on the arresting team were moving out carrying bulletproof vests and rifles.At 7:30 p.m., four highway patrolmen on the motorcycles arrived. They were going to escort the CIDG convoy that would take De Lima to jail.The convoy—made up of three jeeps, a coaster and four motorcycle escorts—rolled out of Camp Crame around 9 p.m. and turned south on Edsa.There were reports that the CIDG team, led by Chief Insp. Garman Manabat, was going directly to the Senate but the team decided to go to De Lima’s home in Parañaque City.Dramatic chaseWatched by thousands as television and social media showed its progress, the convoy snaked through the traffic along Edsa until it broke through gridlock in Makati.The policemen reached De Lima’s residence in South Bay Village at around 10 p.m., but when the team tried to serve the warrant, they were told that the senator was not home.Empty-handed, the policemen left the subdivision at around 10:15 p.m. and headed back north.After nearly two hours of snaking through the streets of Metro Manila, the CIDG team sent to arrest De Lima arrived at the Senate at 10:44 p.m.Overnight watchThe more than two dozen officers, including two policewomen, formed up in the parking lot inside the Senate compound.They put on their bulletproof vests and held their rifles but they were not allowed to enter the building as their officers negotiated with the Senate security for De Lima’s surrender.The CIDG officers agreed to wait until 10 a.m. Friday and so the policemen stood down and returned to their vehicles to rest—and hold vigil—until De Lima turned herself in nine hours later.RELATED VIDEOS",1
"President Duterte urges Filipinos to preserve the country’s sovereignty as it marks today (Monday) the 119th anniversary of the proclamation of Philippine independence.In a statement, Mr. Duterte on Sunday paid homage to the Filipino revolutionaries who fought against Spanish colonizers more than a century ago and declared Philippine independence from Spain.“Let us take inspiration from our forebears who valiantly fought and offered their lives so that we may have liberties that we enjoy today,” Mr. Duterte said.“Let us pay homage to their heroism by preserving our sovereignty and performing our own civic rights and responsibilities,” he added.Mr. Duterte said it was the inherent duty of the country’s citizens to ensure that the Philippines “fulfills its destiny as a great and prosperous nation.”Free nation“More than a century ago, thousands laid down their lives so that we may live with the dignity and rights befitting a free nation,” Mr. Duterte said.“The journey to freedom was a long and ardous one—which our countrymen paid for with blood, sweat and the ultimate act of selfless sacrifice,” he said.“Despite the insurmountable hardships, the patriotism and undaunted spirit of the Filipino led to our triumph against the shackles of slavery and abuse. On that day, we showed our colonizers and the rest of the world what Filipinos are made of.”",1
"The loudest rallying cries from Colorado teachers protesting for more education dollars were about dwindling paychecks that are steadily losing ground to the state’s rising cost of living.Teachers usually say a persistent funding shortage, which has cost public schools $6.6 billion since 2009, led them to walk off the job and close down schools last week. Among the biggest reasons for lagging pay is one of the least understood: The rising cost of state pensions.Colorado isn’t the only state where an underfunded retirement system has played a role in a teacher uprising sweeping the U.S. In Kentucky, educators in at least 20 school districts walked out of their classrooms after the GOP-led Legislature in March passed a measure reducing retirement benefits for future teachers.Elsewhere, pay and other benefits, such as healthcare, have been at the forefront of teachers’ demands, including in Arizona, where a historic statewide strike has closed down schools for four days. But that doesn’t mean rising pension costs are not a factor behind the scenes.Public pension systems nationwide face record levels of debt, totaling $1.4 trillion, according to a recent Pew Charitable Trusts study. That puts downward pressure on wages and benefit checks as governments struggle to close the funding gap. It suggests the recent outcry over teacher pay could spread in coming years, whether pension costs are widely acknowledged as a driving factor or not.“I think what you see happening in the state and local and municipal sector is it has now become very, very clear how expensive defined benefit plans are. I think we’re headed for a big crisis across the country,” said Olivia Mitchell, executive director of the Pension Research Council at the University of Pennsylvania. “Pensions are now becoming the tail that wags the government dog, if you will.”In Colorado, school district payments to the public pension fund have roughly doubled since 2006, from about 10 percent of payroll to 20 percent. That has squeezed personnel budgets when the state also was cutting funding during the economic downturn.In that time, average teacher salaries have grown 21 percent, from $44,439 to $53,768, according to salary data from the National Education Association. But inflation in the greater Denver area has outpaced it, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, leaving teachers with an 8 percentage point drop in buying power.Since the recession, Colorado school districts have shed staff, frozen pay and cut programming to make ends meet. Some have shifted to four-day weeks.Pension costs have played a role in the financial woes at Cheyenne Mountain School District in Colorado Springs, Superintendent Walt Cooper said. Since 2009, the district has shuttered an elementary school and instituted a pay freeze twice. Other years, it could only offer minimal raises that fell short of inflation, he said.“Technically, it did come out of raises,” Cooper said. “Because if we knew we were going to have to increase our (pension) contributions by $250,000 the next year, for us, it’s all coming out of the same pot.”For Colorado teachers, the pension’s role in school funding struggles adds insult to injury.Additional contributions are not padding the benefits of current teachers. The bulk of the money that school districts spend on the Public Employees’ Retirement Association is paying off $32 billion in benefits previously promised to public-sector retirees but never properly funded.Meanwhile, teachers are being asked to work longer hours at lower pay than their predecessors for benefits that are steadily being whittled away.Current teachers indirectly paying for their predecessors’ retirement is not unique to Colorado. A 2016 study by Bellwether Education Partners found that $14 of every $20 that school districts contribute to the pension of each educator nationally are paying off unfunded debts, with just $6 going to the worker’s retirement.The disparity is about twice as stark in Colorado. Just $3 of every $20 spent per teacher goes to their retirement, according to an analysis by the state retirement system.The costs of those debts are likely to get worse before they get better. Colorado’s pension is among the worst funded in the U.S., and lawmakers are considering several solutions to shore it up.Democrats and Republicans disagree on what taxpayers should contribute and the extent that employees should pay in. But lawmakers on both sides agree on cutting retirement benefits more deeply.Cutting future benefits worries teachers. Public sector workers in Colorado don’t receive Social Security, so proposed cuts to cost-of-living raises will leave them more vulnerable to inflation over time.“We don’t have another option. So what happens to PERA affects us for the rest of our lives,” said Suzanne Etheredge, president of the Pueblo Education Association, whose members recently voted to authorize a strike following three straight years of difficult contract talks.",1
"Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV on Wednesday sought a Senate inquiry into the possible conflict of interest in the awarding of billions of pesos worth of government contracts to companies owned by relatives of Special Assistant to the President (SAP) Christopher “Bong” Go.Trillanes said government officials and employees were held to a higher set of standards and “expected at all times to put the interest of the public above their own.”“There is an urgent need to look into this matter as conflict of interest or undue influence exerted by government officials … in the conduct of government transactions threatens the quality of service the public is receiving,” the senator said.Go on Wednesday said he was “very excited [to have] another Senate faceoff with Mr. Trillanes.”Speed up inquiryThe senator, he said, should speed up the inquiry because the former mutineer might end up hiding should the court grant the warrant for his arrest based on President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent proclamation voiding his amnesty.The President’s longtime aide said he had observed delicadeza all his life and would resign if Trillanes could prove he was involved in any corruption.“But if he won’t be able to prove that I am involved, or that I influenced [the government] or intervened, he should resign,” Go said.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that Go could defend himself on the issue, adding that it was up to the Senate to investigate the matter.“I’m not aware of any conflict of interest on the part of anyone, and I’m sure SAP Bong Go can very well defend himself,” Roque told reporters.The senator said his resolution should be referred to the civil service, government reorganization and professional regulation committee which he chairs. The same panel is looking into government contracts bagged by the family of Solicitor General Jose Calida.Davao region projectsIn his resolution, Trillanes cited the report of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, which named CLTG Builders and Alfrego Builders and Supplies as among the top contractors that bagged government projects for the Davao region.The senator noted that CLTG “coincidentally” also stands for the initials of Go, whose full name is Christopher Lawrence Tesoro Go.The company, which is owned by Go’s father, bagged P1.87 billion worth of infrastructure projects for the Davao region from 2007 to 2017.In 2017, CLTG also got P2.7 billion in joint ventures with four other contractors, including Alfrego Builders and Supplies, which is owned by Go’s father and stepbrother.Trillanes said CLTG Builders failed to meet the deadline for its joint venture projects and had a B-license, which means it cannot undertake big-ticket projects without a partner.Trillanes filed the resolution while waiting for the court’s ruling on the validity of the order for his arrest based on the President’s revocation of his amnesty.",1
"Tax experts favor the proposed amicable settlement of the P3.2 billion tax debt of boxing champion and Sarangani Congressman Manny Pacquiao.Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Caesar Dulay revealed that there are ongoing talks for an out-of-court settlement on Pacquiao’s case.Former BIR tax fraud chief Frederick Capitan said the proposed deal would be beneficial for the government as the latter will immediately get much needed cash, instead of spending time and effort for a protracted trial..Capitan even warned that the BIR might even lose the case before the Court of Tax Appeals, similar to what happened to many big-ticket cases.He also said the deal will be advantageous for Pacquiao as he can start again with a clean slate and even get huge discounts if he settles his tax debts. The Tax Code allows a taxpayer to pay only 40 percent of the basic tax payable if the assessment is of “doubtful validity.”The BIR commissioner may even further lower the assessment as provided in the Tax Code.Pacquiao was originally assessed as having owed the BIR P2.2 billion for his boxing prize winnings in 2008 and 2009.The amount, however, ballooned to more than P3.2 billion due to the 50-percent surcharge and 20-percent annual interest on the tax due.Pacquiao could have avoided the tax trouble if he had complied with the directive of then BIR Commissioner Kim Henares to present the original receipts of the withholding tax on his winnings that were remitted to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Tax experts said the BIR could not have imposed the huge tax liabilities if Pacquiao presented the IRS papers because taxes paid in the US are creditable to his income tax return here as stipulated in the bilateral tax agreement between the two countries.",1
"Where the fuck have you all been?Where the fuck was all the outcry when Imelda Marcos became a Leyte congresswoman in 1995 after the SC ruled in her favor in a disqualification case?Where the fuck was all the outcry when she was cleared of all charges of taking money out of the country in 2008 due to ""reasonable doubt""?Where the fuck was all the outcry when the Aquinos, after taking power when the Marcoses fled the country after the People Power revolution, decided to divvy up many of the confiscated lands and properties among their own cronies, further perpetuating the abuse of power they claim to be correcting and depriving farmers of the chance to earn a decent livelihood? Dahil ba na si Cory yung manok nyo noon?Where was the outcry when ALL OF YOU MORONS KNEW that the Marcoses wanted to bury him at the, yet enacted no laws to prevent this during the long, long, LONG years when lawmakers had the opportunity to do so.Where was the outcry when Ramos was elected president, when valid claims of him cheating by Miriam Santiago came to the fore, when Ramos was LITERALLY THE PHILIPPINE CONSTABULARY CHIEF, of the unit responsible for arresting and torturing majority of the Martial Law victims. Where is the outcry NOW, when Ramos is literally being treated today like he's allowed to have a fucking opinion on anything. Was it because his presidential term was marked by a period of economic progress? Is that why you think he should be given a pass? You mean like a lot of the Marcos supporters who enjoyed economic prosperity during his reign and therefore also gave him a pass for his horrible atrocities? OrWhere were you all when the military men under Ramos' admin killed my friend and drowned him in the Pasig River for whistleblowing corruption in the ROTC - when I, as a frightened seventeen-year-old teen, looked around and saw no empathy? Nothing but ""Where was the outcry when history books were being revised not only to put Marcos in a more flattering light, but to put Ramos, the Aquinos, etc. as paragons of virtue who can do nothing wrong, without understanding the REAL political motivations behind the People Power Revolution? That the 'revolution' was originally engineered by Juan Ponce Enrile and Ramos because Marcos was on the verge of imprisoning THEM and they wanted to find a way out? That EVERYONE, from Manuel L. Quezon down to Rodrigo Duterte (ironic that people would look up to Quezon and then demonize Duterte given their similarities, down to their womanizing ways and attempts to make peace with supposed 'enemies' - Quezon with Japan, and Duterte with China), is responsible for the shithole we're all in right now?You want to know why the orange Shitlord von Fuckface is the US president-elect right now? Because everyone, Republicans and Democrats alike, sat on their hands and refused to acknowledge their own history. It's happening all over the world because people as a race are generally shit at remembering fuck-all. History repeats itself because we are morons, because we never believe that things happen unless it happens to us personally, because we wait around and assume someone else will clean up our own shitty messes.Did you think this burial existed in some vacuum somewhere? Do you seriously believe that this burial was NOT a culmination of years of clusterfucks and blissful ignorance by legislators who sat on their hands and did nothing to ensure this bullshit does not happen, and that we were too complacent / lacked the foresight to make any earlier protests - bigger protests that would have brought this to light sooner, bigger protests that could have possibly mattered more in the legal scheme of things?But no - we like or share a political post on Facebook and we think that counts as activism, and then bitch when we realize it makes little impact. Because we attack other people for opposing opinions, block or unfriend them on Facebook so that in the end what we have left is an echo chamber where we see people agreeing with what we believe in and then think that we're the majority because of it. And then news like this happens where we're pushed out of our own personal circlejerk and realize no, we are NOT THE GODDAMN MAJORITY AFTER ALL, and then FINALLY act. Without realizing we all did it to ourselves.And now - ironically, hysterically, blissfully - we only choose to stage a protest NOW, at this point in time where we have the LEAST power to accomplish anything worthwhile.----------------------Erin Ko as posted on Facebook",0

"three times more than the previous year.(This is not to mention U.S.-based corporations moving their headquarters abroad to significantly reduce their tax liability).Another point of contention among expatriates is a federal law called the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or FATCO which compels foreign banks and other financial institutions to provide information to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service about Americans holding accounts. It is meant to catch American expatriates who don’t pay enough taxes, or not pay at all.Bachmann’s bill is brilliantly crafted. The senator had previously announced that she would not be seeking reelection to her Congressional seat in 2014. Sources say she plans to move to Istanbul after her current term expires.

"A cellphone video obtained by GMA News shows Ozamiz Vice Mayor Nova Princess Parojinog-Echavez was trying to hide something as the police search their residential homes during the raid conducted Sunday - the same raid that resulted in the deaths of the mayor of Ozamiz and a provincial board member among 13 others.In the video, it can be seen that the vice mayor snatched something from her bag as the police conducts inspection in her room. But her sleight of hand did not pass the sharp eyes of the inspecting officers who quickly acted to take a look at the item she was so eager to hide from them.Vice Mayor Parojinog put up a struggle at first, refusing to give up the item as the police pry her hands open and was even seen in the video putting something in her mouth (nilunok ang bato). She let up eventually and it was revealed that the item she's trying to hide away is a plastic packet filled with white substance.The cops immediately put handcuffs on her after the discovery of the item.Meanwhile, the Mayor of Ozamiz who was the vice mayor's father, along with 14 others, was killed in that same raid when a firefight ensued.During the clash, the mayor's wife, and his brother, who was a provincial board member, also perished.According to a statement by the Ozamiz City police director, the raid yielded more than one kilogram of shabu from the houses of mayor and vice mayor Parojinog.",0
"The Bureau of Customs (BOC) could curb smuggling, including of illegal drugs, by getting tougher on consignees and putting a stop to the practice of getting “consignees for hire,” according to Sen. Richard Gordon.In a statement issued after a hearing called by the Senate blue ribbon committee on Tuesday, Gordon said traffickers were using consignees to smuggle illegal drugs into the Philippines.The committee was looking into the smuggling of P6.8 billion worth of “shabu” (crystal meth) into the country in magnetic lifters, which the BOC was disputing and which President Duterte had described as “pure speculation.”Dogs detected shabuBut the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the lead agency in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, is standing by its finding that the magnetic lifters found in a Cavite warehouse had contained shabu, as indicated by the reaction of drug-sniffing dogs.The drug was already gone when the magnetic lifters were found by the authorities.The consignee of the magnetic lifters, Marina Signapan of SMYD Trading, claimed that she was just the consignee on record for the cargo.Signapan said someone she knew called her to say that he had a cargo arriving and it was consigned to SMYD Trading.She said she got angry because her company’s name was used without her permission.But she later relented and charged P180,000 for using her company’s name, she said.The amount covered her P50,000-fee plus duties and taxes, she said.Register them allGordon said the government should not be lenient with consignees.It should require all consignees to be registered and should see to it that they have legitimate operations, he said.“Shouldn’t we be checking if consignees have warehouses and are not hole-in-the-wall operations?” he said.Even trucking companies doing business with the consignees should be made to register with the BOC, he said.The BOC should also shorten the period it allows before it declares unclaimed cargos abandoned, he added.Last month, customs agents found 500 kilograms worth of shabu in magnetic lifters that arrived at Manila International Container Port in June and abandoned there.Gordon said the contraband could have been found earlier if the cargo had been declared abandoned after a few days.CorruptionHe said shortening the period for declaring cargos abandoned would have the benefit of decongesting the ports and reducing opportunities for corruption.“Shipments should be able to leave the ports quickly so that people would not think that officials are asking for bribes. If the shipments are not claimed, that means they are checking if they could talk to an official,” Gordon said.Fast-tracking the release of cargos would also make the country more attractive to investors, he added.The senator said it was a matter of concern that large amounts of illegal drugs had slipped past customs officials.",1
"in dealing with the country’s territorial dispute with China, the Muslim rebel movement, the pork barrel scandal, and yes, even his decision on naming National Artists.The Adobo Chronicles can now confirm that indeed, Aquino will NOT be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize this year. The reason? His staff were late in submitting his nomination which was due on January 31.According to the Nobel Prize rules:“Nomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3,000 individuals, usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded. These individuals are often academics working in a relevant area. For the Peace Prize, inquiries are sent to governments, members of international courts, professors and rectors, former Peace Prize laureates and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award.”So blame it on Filipino time. Or, maybe, Aquino’s staff were too busy preparing statements and press releases denying every single allegation or criticism lodged at the president.Till next year.",0
"President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent overtures to the communist New People’s Army (NPA) such as offering homes and livelihood to every rebel who reforms, showed that he was “sincere” in bringing lasting peace to the country, according to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.Lorenzana on Friday said the NPA should stop its illegal activities and “return to the fold of the law.”“We reiterate our call for the NPA to stop all their illegal activities, return to the fold of the law and be part of the real change that the President has spearheaded for the betterment of our country and the lives of our people,” the Defense chief added in a statement.Upon his arrival in Davao City from his working visit to Japan, Duterte asked the NPA rebels to surrender and lay down their firearms, saying there are jobs waiting for them.According to Lorenzana, the latest call of the President “only shows” that he is giving the NPA–the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP)—”every chance” in achieving a peaceful resolution to the long-standing armed conflict between government forces and the communist guerrillas.“He has offered homes and livelihood to every NPA fighter [who] returns to the fold of the law. The President has wholeheartedly gave the chance to the NPA [rebels] to change and simply live their lives. His offer to accommodate members of the communist movement shows his sincerity,” he said.Lorenzana added that a “number” of NPA members had accepted the offer of the government to help them.“We are delighted to note that a number of NPA [rebels] have accepted the offer and are now restarting to live normal lives. There were a lot [of NPA members] who initiated to return to the government,” he said.“The Department of National Defense fully supports the peace and security agenda of the President,” Lorenzana added.The President aborted peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines over continuing attacks of the NPA on government troops and personnel, including a convoy of the Presidential Security Group in Arakan, North Cotabato, in July.The NDFP is an umbrella group that counts the NPA and the CPP as members.",1
"Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) suffered from being tagged as one of the worst airports in the world for several years because of being ‘ dirty, crowded, noisy and extremely hot airport’ the ‘laglag bala scheme’ which victimized passengers also worsen the image of the Philippine airport.But now,the once infamous NAIA is finally out of the worst airports list, according to the latest survey results of travel website ‘sleepinginairports’The inclusion of NAIA in the said list this year was attributed to the issue of ‘laglag-bala’ or airport personnel’s allegedly victimized passengers by putting bullets in their luggage so they can forcefully ask their victims for money.Thirty cases of the scheme were recorded in 2015, according to Philippine National Police Aviation Security Group.The scheme was mysteriously gone after Rodrigo Duterte became the President and threaten the people involved in laglag bala scheme that he’s going to shove bullets in their mouth if they caught victimizing passengers again.“Work, work, work lang. While it is good that we are not listed among the worst, let us work even harder to be included amongst the best,” Secretary Tugade said. “We should be careful that we do not backslide.

"THE Philippine government will fast-track discussions on the implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and the possible completion of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) during the its chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEA) this year.What the government will refrain from doing during its ASEAN chairmanship is raising the July 2016 award issued by the Permanent Court of Arbitration on the South China Sea, Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. said in a news briefing Wednesday.Member states of ASEAN and China signed the DOC in November 2002 in Cambodia after several years of prolonged negotiations. The DOC was essentially a compromise between the two positions of doing nothing and having a legally- binding agreement. The text of the DOC reveals three purposes: promoting confidence-building measures, engaging in practical maritime cooperation, and setting the stage for the discussion and conclusion of a formal and binding COC.According to Yasay, discussions on the DOC are ongoing on the ministerial level which is precisely why the Philippines is hopeful the regional grouping will be able to come up with a COC by mid-2017.At the same time, Yasay said China has been “very cooperative” in coming up with a COC.“China has always been part of the discussion,” he said. “We are sitting down with China in the formulation of the COC. They are part of the process. We’ll not take them by suprise.”He pointed out that once the COC is unanimously approved, all the parties will be bound by it.At the same time, Yasay said the government will also bring to the table a number of measures that the Duterte administration helped pushed forward including the return of Filipino fishermen to the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea as a “victory of the rule of law.”“The Philippines is internationally known for its firm and constant advocacy of the rule of law,” he said. “The return to the shoal proves the effectiveness of pragmatic approach in dealing with China.”On the other hand, while PCA ruling is “something that is there” and that it is a final and binding decision to the parties, the Philippines will not raise the matter.“There is really no useful benefit,” he said. “This matter will be raised with China at a future time. A discussion of this issue will be counter-productive.”Last year, ASEAN and Chinese foreign ministers issued a joint statement in Lao PDR wherein they reaffirmed the importance of the DOC which “embodies the collective commitment of the Parties to promote peace, stability, mutual trust and confidence in the region, in accordance with the UN Charter and universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).”They further stated their belief in the need to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea region which “serves the fundamental interests of ASEAN Member States and China as well as the international community.”",1
"to complaints against perceived enemies of the previous administration. On the other hand, complaints involving leading personalities and allies of the previous administration gathered dust.And when the Ombudsman did file cases against administration personalities over the DAP, legal experts were one in saying that the case was watered down to ensure dismissal by the courts.The Ombudsman exemplified selective prosecution which even experts found “obvious and manifest.” This is one of the basis for the clamor for her impeachment.I believe in strengthening our institutions and protecting human rights.

"Department of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre during his speech in Camp Crame urged the Philippine National Police and National Bureau of Investigation to dig deeper on the real reason why the South Korean Businessman Jee Ick Joo was killed inside Camp Crame last year.He believes that there’s some people who really wanted to do anything just to destroy the image of the President and the PNP Director General who both enjoying a high trust rating in fighting crime and illegal drugs.Secretary Aguirre revealed that there’s some people who used the incident to destroy President Rodrigo Duterte through PNP chief Director General Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa.“Sinisira ng ilan ang PNP.

"Vatican City –Pope Francis has ordered the Vatican takeover of an elite Catholic society in Peru whose founder is accused of sexually and physically abusing children and former members of the group.The move, announced by the Vatican on Wednesday, is the latest in a saga that has damaged the reputation of the Catholic Church in Peru and comes a week before Francis is set to make his first visit as pope to that country and Chile.Victims of sexual abuse say he has not done enough to put a stop to it. The credibility of a commission he formed in 2014 has been severely damaged by the defections of senior members who accused the Vatican of dragging its feet.The Vatican said the pope had appointed an administrator to run Sodalitium Christianae Vitae (SCV), whose founder, Luis Figari, a layman, is scheduled to go on trial in Peru later this year for the sexual abuse of minors. Figari has denied wrongdoing.An internal report by the group last year concluded that Figari, who founded the group in 1971 and headed it until 2010, and three other high-ranking former members had abused 19 minors and 10 adults.Most of the alleged cases took place between the 1970s and 2000.A statement on the group’s website said it welcomed the pope’s intervention and promised full cooperation with his administrator. “We once again reaffirm our absolute obedience to the Holy Father and Holy Mother Church,” it said.The 2017 internal report described Figari as a charismatic, authoritarian and cult-like leader who publicly humiliated members as part of his strategy to control them.Peruvian authorities opened an investigation into Figari in 2015 following the publication of a book on the abuse allegations by Peruvian journalists Pedro Salinas and Pao Ugaz.Salinas himself once belonged to the ultra-conservative Sodalitium, whose members include businessmen, writers and politicians from Peru’s upper classes and which was founded as part of a backlash against “Liberation Theology”, which took the side of the poor.Salinas said he was skeptical about whether the takeover would translate into real reform. “So far, we’ve seen gestures, damage control and maneuvers to protect the Church’s reputation,” Salinas said in a Reuters TV interview.‘Gravity of Information’The Vatican statement said the pope had been following the group’s situation “with worry” for years and had taken the action “after a detailed analysis of all the documentation.”It said the pope was concerned about “the gravity of information regarding the internal system, (religious) formation (of members) and economic and financial management”.A lawyer for victims said last month a public prosecutor was seeking pretrial detention for Figari and three other former leaders of the group.The Vatican, which officially recognized the group in 1997, last year prohibited Figari from having any contact with members.The takeover of the SCV is similar to action the Vatican took against another conservative group, the Legionaries of Christ.An administrator was appointed to run the Legionaries after its founder, the late Mexican priest Marcial Maciel Degollado, was discovered to have been a sexual abuser with a secret family.The Vatican said the SCV would be run by Colombian Bishop Noel Antonio Londono Buitrago.",1
"Duty Free Philippine Corp. (DFPC) announced that it is creating a detailed record of the items pulled out from the DFPC by the Department of Tourism (DoT) last year to ensure accountability.DFPC Chief Operating Officer Vicente Pelagic Angala issued the statement on Friday following a Commission on Audit (CoA) report that former Tourism Secretary Wanda Tulfo Teo has purchased merchandise amounting P2.17 million from Duty Free Shops (DFS) using the DoT funds.CoA report showed that Teo bought “toiletries, kitchen wares, beddings, appliances, canned goods, branded bags, luxury brand cosmetics, chocolates and others” using DoT shares from Duty Free annual profits.Angala insisted that the DFPC has its own Interim Guidelines on the issuance and usage of Gate Pass Slips (GPS) for withdrawal of merchandise from DFS.He added that last year, the DFPC received official requests from the DoT for various Duty Free merchandise for Sponsorship and Corporate Giveaways by the tourism department.“These requests were evaluated and found compliant with the guidelines of GPS issuance and usage,” Angala said in a statement.According to him, usage of GPS for withdrawal of merchandise with commercial value is limited to contributions to other organizations, representation expenses, corporate gifts and sponsorships, conversion to office equipment or supplies, and subsidies and donations. Meanwhile, withdrawal of merchandise with no commercial value using GPS is limited to promo/sample items/materials and suppliers’ advertising materials.",1
"Reviving death penalty would be an international embarrassment for the Philippines, Amnesty International (AI) said on Friday even as it pointed out that the country is a signatory to various covenants on human rights, including the protocol to abolish the capital punishment.AI Philippines vice chair Romeo Cabarde Jr. said there is also no logical connection between imposing death penalty and reducing crime rate, citing the increase in the country’s crime rate in 1999 when seven convicts were executed by the Estrada administration.“We call on the incoming president to carefully think about the policy proposals under his administration in order to ensure that none of his proposed measures will contravene the very commitment we made before the world,” Cabarde said in a media forum in Quezon City.The group presented a program of action to be submitted to presumptive President-elect Rodrigo Duterte to ensure that human rights is made a priority and embedded in all government agencies and programs.“Putting an end to extrajudicial executions, unlawful arrests, secret detention, enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment is one of our non-negotiables for President Duterte,” AI Philippines chair Ritz Lee Santos III said.In a news conference after the May 9 elections, Duterte said bringing back the death penalty would be a central part of his war on crime.Breaking promise?Cabarde noted that the Philippines is a state party to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which aims for the worldwide total abolition of death penalty.“What kind of face are we going to show the rest of the world, having promised at a certain point that we will eradicate death penalty and here comes a new leader who wants to reimpose death penalty just because he wants to curb criminality,” Cabarde said.Based on the Commission on Human Rights report cited by Cabarde, the crime rate in 1999 even increased by 15.3 percent or a total of 82,538 compared with the previous year’s 71,527 cases despite the executions of death row convicts.Meanwhile, European diplomats and civil rights advocates have also raised concern on the reimposition of death penalty in the Philippines, saying it is anti-poor and will not deter crimes.Numbers game in CongressGerman Ambassador to the Philippines Thomas Ossowski said the reimposition of death penalty is contrary to the human rights principles that the Philippines is known for in the world.“Germany is very adamant in that (the reimposition of death penalty). We are against death penalty,” said Ossowksi in an interview Thursday night at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF) anniversary in Makati.Former Deputy Speaker Lorenzo “Erin” Tañada III, who espoused the bill to repeal the death penalty, expressed hopes that lawmakers will vote against the proposal to reimpose it.“It’s going to be a numbers game in Congress and those who voted for the repeal of death penalty in 2006 have been reelected and hopefully they will maintain their position and vote against its reimposition,” said Tañada in an interview at the sidelines of the FNF event.Jules Maaten, outgoing country director of FNF, said “state killing” through capital punishment sends a wrong signal “that every person can also commit killings.” TVJRELATED STORIESSenators-elect Villanueva, Pacquiao back death penaltyDe Lima vows to fight return of death penaltyRELATED VIDEO",1

"A private company will invest P4.5 billion for the rehabilitation and upgrading of the water works system of the Batangas City Water District (BCWD) under a 25-year Public-Private Partnership (PPP) contract.The Sangguniang Panglunsod (SP) council, however, questioned why the project proposal was passed without the intervention of the city government like other similar projects in the city which are under the PPP.At last Monday’s SP session, BCWD Legal Counsel and Spokesperson Leilani Cepillo-Gonzales confirmed that the BCWD board of directors passed the resolution authorizing its general manager to sign the joint venture agreement with PrimeWater Infrastructure Corporation.Citing limited resources to finance a necessary rehabilitation of the 42-year-old water piping in the city, Gonzales explained the need for BCWD, an independent body from the city government, to act.Being a Government-Owned Controlled Corporation (GOCC), the BCWD followed the 2013 Revised Guidelines of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on joint venture agreement for GOCCs, she assured.As for increasing water system rates, Gonzales said it is still subject to the approval of the Local Water Utilities and Administration (LWUA).",1

"Detained Sen. Leila de Lima on Saturday joined a growing opposition to President Rodrigo Duterte’s plan to scrap barangay elections in October and instead appoint village officials as part of his war on drugs, saying it could give rise to a new level of political patronage across the country.De Lima, who chairs the Senate electoral reforms and people’s participation committee, said Mr. Duterte’s plan went against the idea that barangays or villages were nonpartisan government units.“Appointing barangay officials, instead of electing them, goes against the principles of shielding them from partisan politics. That is one of the reasons why barangay elections are held separately from national and local elections,” De Lima said in a statement.Mr. Duterte has said all barangay posts should be declared vacant, and the elections in October postponed. He said he wanted incumbent barangay officials replaced with appointees, arguing that about 40 percent of all village chiefs were into illegal drugs.But De Lima argued that the planned move could violate rights to due process.“Those who would be removed and not reappointed may have that stigma of being involved in drugs. They have every right for a chance to clear their names before being removed from office,” she said“Given the political situation at the grassroots and the culture of fabricating accusations, it is possible for baseless recommendations to emanate from mayors so they can have their allies appointed to barangay posts, and maintain control over cities and municipalities. It is political patronage taken to a whole new level.”She said the plan was a “desperate move for the administration to maintain its political capital.”Her position was backed by former Senate President Aquilino “Nene” Pimental Jr., the father of the country’s Local Government Code and the President’s political ally, saying the plan would make local officials beholden to the appointing power.“If the barangay captains and kagawads (aldermen) are appointed, then invariably their loyalty is to the appointing power and not to the people. That would not be good,” Pimentel told the Inquirer. “And if they want it postponed, they have to amend the Local Government Code. You cannot just say we will just appoint the barangay officials. That cannot be done.”“You cannot just forget the law and do what you want,” he added.However, Pimentel said the government should run after specific erring barangay officials instead of a wholesale purge.“Our government is run under a rule of law. If someone violates the law, then he should be prosecuted and imprisoned,” Pimentel said.“But just because a mayor commits a crime, you don’t say ‘Let us just appoint all the mayors.’ No,” he added.Instead, he said administration allies in Congress should come out with a law amending the Local Government Code if they want the barangay elections postponed.“We are a democracy and common sense demands that we abide by the strictures and constitutional laws of the land,” he said.James Jimenez, spokesperson of the Commission on Elections, said the poll body was reserving its comment on Mr. Duterte’s plan pending a thorough study of the matter. He noted that there were “consequences” in postponing the vote.",1
"an agreement that Germany, like France, worked hard to secure and believes should remain in place.Although Germany is unlikely to accept a wholesale rewrite of the deal, Berlin has indicated that it is prepared to consider add-ons that would crack down on Tehran’s ballistic missile program and curb Iranian efforts to strengthen its strategic role in the Middle East. Earlier this week, Macron made clear that France would not follow the U.S. lead if Trump decides to withdraw from the agreement.Macron later told French reporters that he has no “inside information” on Trump’s decision on the Iran deal but noted that it’s clear the U.S. president “is not very much eager to defend it.”The second deadline concerns the extension of new U.S. tariffs on foreign-made steel and aluminum, which some fear could trigger a global wave of protectionism that would deeply harm a trading nation such as Germany.Though German officials have signaled that their goals for the visit are modest, Berlin last week announced plans to step up defense spending, a long-standing demand in Washington. While Germany is still likely to miss the goal of devoting 2 percent of its gross domestic product to defense that’s expected of NATO members, the move could be taken as a sign that Berlin has gotten the message.Some German officials have been quietly playing with the idea of buying U.S.-made F-35 jets replace the country’s aging fleet of Tornado planes. The hope is that this would show Berlin’s willingness to act on military spending while also improving the U.S. trade balance with Germany.",1

"Catholic bishops are calling for an investigation into the killing of three lumad leaders in Surigao del Sur, allegedly by paramilitary forces, even as they criticized the Aquino administration’s alacrity in defending the suspect group.“[We ask] the government for an honest, thorough, impartial and speedy investigation so that the guilty may be held to account for their wrongdoing,” said Archbishop Socrates Villegas, the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, in a statement.The CBCP is “profoundly disturbed by reports that national leaders have been quick to exonerate the militia group of wrongdoing,” he said.“This alarming eagerness to deny culpability does not augur well for truth and for justice,” Villegas added.According to Villegas, such declarations could only be believable after the conduct of a “reliable and trustworthy investigation by impartial and competent persons.”“If made before any such investigation, they disturbingly suggest a refusal to hold accountable those to whom the administration so eagerly extends its mantle of protection,” he said.According to press reports, on Sept. 1, a militia group called the Magahat-Bagani Force killed Emerito Samarca, executive director of the Alternative Learning Center for Agricultural Livelihood Development (Alcadev), Dionel Campos, a community leader from the Mapasu indigenous group, and the latter’s cousin, Aurelio Sinzo, in Barangay (village) Diatagon, Lianga, Surigao del Sur.Alcadev is privately run but state-regulated learning institution that provides basic and technical education to lumad children in communities rarely reached by government services.Villegas said he found it “troubling” that a militia group had been suspected, noting that these paramilitary groups which government makes use of for counter-insurgency and counter-rebellion maneuvers “do not fall under a clear, established and accessible chain of command.”He said their association with the government could be “pernicious, for while they act with the tacit consent, if not authority, of state agents, they cannot be held to account for their actions by the regular channels of accountability and attribution that exist in the regular armed forces and police.”International effortsMeanwhile, the militant Karapatan human rights watchdog has written to the special rapporteurs on human rights and indigenous peoples at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) urging them to investigate the lumad killings.“We want international bodies to know what is happening in Mindanao—that the lumad, in defense of their land, are being killed and forced to leave their communities,” said Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay.More than 2,000 Manobo residents fled Lianga town after the killing of Samarca, Campos and Sinzo. Samarca was found with a slit throat and gunshot wounds inside the Alcadev office. Campos was gunned down in front of community members, while Sinzo was beaten with a wooden stick before being shot.Witnesses and local police tagged the Magahat-Bagani Force, a group said to be trained, armed and funded by the military as part of its counter-insurgency program.Surigao del Sur Gov. Johnny Pimentel commented that “the military has created a monster that it can no longer control.” He later disclosed that military officials had asked him to tone down his statements.”Karapatan raised the issue with the UNHRC through letters sent to Victoria Lucia Tauli-Corpuz, special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples; Christof Heyns, special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution; Michel Forst, special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; and Chaloka Beyani, special rapporteur on the promotion of the human rights of internally displaced persons.Part of policy“We reiterate our position that the political killings happening right now are part of the government’s policy and not simply an internal conflict among indigenous peoples as the government wants the public to believe,” Palabay said in a statement.For his part, Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesman Col. Restituto Padilla said the Karapatan move to “demonize” the military was to be expected.Expected move“The attempt to internationalize the issue and demonize the government is always an expected move on their part. It is obviously part of their agenda to hurl all accusations and blame everything on the AFP to besmirch the AFP’s reputation,” Padilla said.He stressed that “the AFP was not involved in the incident and was working and cooperating fully [with] the Philippine National Police to ascertain the facts regarding this disturbance.”It was also conducting an internal investigation “to ascertain if the AFP actions were appropriate relative to this unfortunate incident,” Padilla said",1
"WITH national elections barely six months away, politicians and candidates are working overtime to eliminate rivals, with some of them resorting to a “legal coup d’etat.”Or so claimed Harry Roque Jr., a nominee of the Kabalikat ng Mamamayan (Kabayan) party-list group, of administration standard-bearer, former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas.In a statement, the congressional candidate said Roxas was leading a “legal coup d’etat” and using the ruling Liberal Party’s “influence in the courts” to eliminate his main rivals in the 2016 elections, specifically Sen. Grace Poe, Vice President Jejomar Binay, and possible presidential contender, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte.“The public should be vigilant and closely watch the allies of the administration in the Senate Electoral Tribunal, the Commission on Elections and the Supreme Court, because if we lower our guard, their decisions will not be guided by the rule of law, but by the nation’s current rulers,” said the former University of the Philippines professor.Roque said there were “rumblings” in the legal community about Roxas tapping Senate President Franklin Drilon and lawyers associated with “The Firm” to ensure that Poe, an independent candidate, would be disqualified from the presidential race on questions of residency and citizenship.“The Firm” refers to the CVC Law firm founded by Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, one of whose law partners, Avelino Cruz, was a staunch Roxas ally and was part of President Aquino’s legal team in 2010.There are also efforts to put Binay behind bars and prevent Duterte from running for the presidency, Roque said, adding that such maneuvers would leave as Roxas’ lone opponent Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago, whose survey ratings, he said, were allegedly lower than that of the LP standard-bearer.Sought for comment, Akbayan Rep. Barry Gutierrez, concurrent spokesperson of the LP’s Team Daang Matuwid senatorial slate, described Roque’s statement as baseless.“These allegations are based solely and exclusively on unnamed anonymous sources,” Gutierrez said. “They’re hearsay. It goes without saying that there is absolutely no truth to these claims,” he added.According to some government lawyers and administration allies, Binay, who is facing corruption and plunder charges, was not immune from suit and could face a prison term.Duterte has been under fire from the justice department over allegations that he was involved in the so-called “Davao Death Squad” vigilante group.“During the time of President Corazon Aquino, the threats to democracy were the coups launched left and right by rogue elements of the Armed Forces. Now a similar coup is underway, right under our noses. But this time its generals wear barong Tagalog and its soldiers are armed with petitions and pleadings,” Roque said.Gutierrez however countered that Binay’s and Poe’s cases “were already being taken up in appropriate tribunals, following regular processes… which are open and have always been open to scrutiny by the public.”Roque should refrain from coming up with rash allegations, he added.“Harry Roque and I were colleagues at the UP College of Law faculty. I am disappointed that he is this quick to make such serious accusations based on the flimsiest of evidence. That’s not what we were taught in UP,” Gutierrez said.",1
"SOLICITOR General Florin Hilbay defended the rights of foundlings before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, asserting that Sen. Grace Poe was natural-born and, hence, qualified to run for public office.Maintaining his stand as counsel defending the Senate Electoral Tribunal’s (SET) ruling in favor of Poe in a separate case, Hilbay also held that Poe, a presidential candidate, satisfied the 10-year residency requirement, saying she had reestablished domicile in the Philippines in 2005.“Foundlings are natural-born citizens under all our Constitutions,” he said of the country’s 1935, 1973 and 1987 Charters.Specifically, the 1935 Constitution, which applies to the case of Poe who was born in 1968, had all the intent to consider foundlings natural-born Filipinos, even without an explicit provision, Hilbay said.Speaking as the “tribune of the people,” or in a case where the Solicitor General’s position is contrary from a government agency’s, Hilbay said framers of the 1935 Constitution saw “no more need to expressly declare foundlings Filipinos because they are already impliedly so recognized.”“In other words, the constitutional silence is fully explained in terms of linguistic efficiency and the avoidance of redundancy. The policy is clear: It is to recognize foundlings, as a class, as Filipinos… under the 1935 Constitution,” Hilbay said.Silently vocal“This inclusive policy is carried over into the 1973 and 1987 Constitution. It is appropriate to invoke a famous scholar as he was paraphrased by Chief Justice (Enrique) Fernando: ‘The Constitution is not silently silent, it is silently vocal,”’ said the Solicitor General.Hilbay took his turn to address the Supreme Court on the fifth round of oral arguments on Poe’s challenge to her disqualification. He was invited to speak despite his earlier refusal to represent the Commission on Elections (Comelec) in the case.The Solicitor General, the chief counsel for government agencies, holds a conflicting position from the Comelec, as he defends SET’s ruling that Poe is a natural-born Filipino. The separate case, which concerns Poe’s qualification for the 2013 senatorial race, is pending in the high court upon Rizalino David’s petition.The Comelec, through its two divisions and later, the entire commission, had disqualified Poe from the presidential race in December last year, ruling that she had committed material misrepresentation in her certificate of candidacy, as she declared she had the citizenship and residency requirements to run for the nation’s highest post.The poll body’s prompted Poe to go to high court, which issued two temporary restraining orders on the Comelec decisions. The case remains pending even as the Comelec began printing ballots for the May elections.History, social contextIn defending the status of Filipino foundlings, Hilbay urged the court not to commit the error of interpreting the Constitution “without reference to history, structure and social context.”“To deny foundlings the most fundamental of their political rights because their class is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution is a simplistic and lackadaisical way to interpret the Constitution,” he said.Hilbay was questioned by Associate Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro, who cited the absence of an explicit constitutional provision on foundlings.“Is it justified for us to impose on our people an interpretation which will supplement the text of the Constitution when there is nothing at all (about foundlings)?” De Castro said in an elevated tone. She said Hilbay was in effect asking the high court “to amend the Constitution.”To which Hilbay replied: “Not at all. Constitutional interpretation is the goal of every judge. The case is absolutely clear in favor of foundlings.”De Castro earlier made her position clear that Poe should not be regarded a natural-born citizen.Statistical probabilityHilbay cited statistics showing that nearly all children born in the Philippines were of Filipino parents.Between 1965 and 1975, the decade within which Poe was born, Hilbay said 661 Filipino children were born for every child born of foreign parents. He noted that a total of 15,986 foreigners were born in the country during the period compared with 10.558 million natural-born Filipinos.“This means that the statistical probability that any child born in the Philippines in that decade would be a natural-born Filipino is 99.83 percent,” Hilbay said in his opening statement.The figure was even higher from 2010 to 2014, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority, said Hilbay, when the ratio of non-Filipino children to natural-born Filipino children was 1:1,357. This means that 99.93 percent of births over those five years were of Filipino parents.Under Associate Justice Lucas Bersamin’s questioning later, Hilbay said these statistics on foundlings would indicate that Poe is a natural-born Filipino.Residency issueHilbay also supported Poe’s position that she had reestablished her domicile in the Philippines in 2005, thus meeting the 10-year residency requirement.Poe, a foundling left by unknown parents at a church in Jaro, Iloilo City, in 1968, was raised by the late actor and 2004 presidential candidate Fernando Poe Jr. and wife Susan Roces, an actress.Poe became an American in 2001, reacquired her Filipino citizenship in 2006 months after returning to the Philippines, and renounced her American allegiance in 2010.Hilbay said that when Poe returned to the Philippines for good after Fernando Poe’s death in December 2004, she had every intent to reestablish domicile here. For one, she had “uprooted” her children from their US schools and enrolled them in Manila, lived with her mother for a while then built a new house.“Based on these facts, the claim that she has been a resident of the Philippines for at least 10 years is a valid claim,” Hilbay said.Sereno questionsChief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno also zeroed in on the residency issue in her interpellation of Comelec Commissioner Arthur Lim.The Comelec has maintained that the reckoning year of Poe’s residency is 2006, as she had declared in her 2012 certificate of candidacy for the 2013 senatorial race that she would have been a resident of the Philippines “for six years and six months” by Election Day in 2013.By this reckoning, Poe would have only been a Philippine resident for nine years and six months by May 9, Election Day.Sereno pointed out to Lim that Poe had brought back her children, put them in Philippine schools, built a house and even informed the US postal service of their abandonment of their US address, and still: “You doubt her resolve, even after 11 years she’s still here?”After more than five hours, the Supreme Court adjourned Tuesday’s proceedings at 7:30 p.m., terminating oral arguments on Poe’s case.Sereno ordered the parties to file by Monday their memoranda wrapping up their arguments, after which the consolidated cases are deemed submitted for resolution.",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte’s second year in office continued to be filled with controversy, but it also saw the approval of key legislation to fulfill some of his campaign promises, according to former Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III.Pimentel, who headed the Senate during the first two years of the Duterte administration, said among the major measures passed during the period were the free college tuition law, the law to raise the base pay of uniformed personnel and the first package of tax reforms, which, however, has been blamed for rising prices.“We delivered,” Pimentel said. “If we audit the campaign promises, I think the President and the Senate and the House of Representatives were able to meet these because of the support of the other legislators.”But Pimentel also acknowledged that there were promises that had not been met.‘Endo’ yet to endA law to put an end to “endo",1

He faces kidnapping and murder charges before the branch 9 of the Regional Trial Court in Marawi City for committing the crimes last 2014.Dimaporo said Dimakuta was part of the group who abducted a relative, who was 24 years old that time, and behead him when their demand was not given.Dimaporo didn’t disclose the victim’s identity and the said demand.“Pinugutan at chinap-chop nila ang biktima nang hindi binigay ang demand nila at itinapon sa iba’t-ibang lugar sa Piagapo (They killed and chopped the victim’s body into pieces and threw it in areas of Piagapo when they didn’t give their demands),” Dimaporo said.The suspect was already committed while other 20 suspects are still at-large.",1
"Public disapproval of constitutional revision and federalism is no reason to stop moves to amend the 1987 Constitution, according to the spokesperson for the Consultative Committee that drafted a proposed federal charter for the Duterte administration.Conrado Generoso told a Senate hearing on Tuesday that public sentiment about revising the Constitution and adopting federalism was bound to change in the coming days, as the country had just begun discussions on the proposal.A Pulse Asia poll conducted from June 15 to June 21 found that 67 percent of Filipinos disapproved of the amendment of the 1987 Constitution, while 62 percent opposed the proposal for a shift to federalism.Change in public pulse“The consultative committee has just finished its draft, and the discussion, presentation, consultation and debate have just begun. So we would imagine it would only be in the coming weeks and months that the public pulse would change,” Generoso said at the Senate inquiry into proposals for the amendment of the Constitution.“To suggest therefore that the proposals should be dropped entirely because there is not yet a majority supporting it might be wrong,” he said.Candidates for political positions don’t drop out of the race just because they rank low in polls in the beginning, he added.Minority lawmakers in the House of Representatives, however, expect more Filipinos to oppose constitutional revision and the introduction of federalism as the people realize that the proposal will only serve politicians’ vested interests.Commenting on the Pulse Asia poll, Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano said in a statement that the absence of public clamor and lack of knowledge about the proposal rendered the efforts for the amendment of the Constitution for a shift to federalism “inorganic.”“Clearly, there is no public clamor. Worse, the people do not have the capacity and understanding, as of the moment, to engage in the process of Charter change. This attempt is premature,” Alejano said.Vested interestsMakabayan bloc Reps. Antonio Tinio and France Castro said the Duterte administration should expect more Filipinos to oppose the proposal, as “vested interests” behind it continued to be exposed.Rep. Ariel Casilao, also a member of the Makabayan bloc, called on Malacañang and its allies to take the cue from the Pulse Asia poll and abandon attempts to tinker with the Constitution.Deputy Speaker Gwendolyn Garcia said on Monday that the House would give priority to the proposal after the resumption of sessions next Monday, fueling suspicion that President Duterte’s majority allies would declare a House-alone constituent assembly that would amend the Constitution.The Senate has rejected a constituent assembly, unless the voting on proposed amendments to the Constitution would be separate.On Tuesday, Sen. Panfilo Lacson described the talk of a House-alone constituent assembly in graphic terms on Twitter.“This doltish notion of revising the Charter via Con-ass (constituent assembly), Con-con (constitutional convention), or even people’s initiative without the [Senate’s] participation in a bicameral system such as ours smells worse than week-old shit [in] an unflushed toilet of a congressman suffering from colon cancer,” Lacson said.Lacson did not mention any names, but Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez earlier said the House could sit as a constituent assembly and propose changes to the Constitution even without the Senate.But at Tuesday’s hearing at the Senate, the country’s top legal experts said the House alone could not propose revisions to the Constitution, and that the two chambers of Congress must vote separately on the proposals.Former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr. said both houses of Congress must introduce resolutions calling for a constituent assembly for the process to commence.Separate voting is also needed because, otherwise, the House would just overwhelm the Senate.Former Chief Justice Reynato Puno, head of the consultative committee that drafted a proposed federal Charter, agreed with Pimentel that the House alone could not amend the Constitution.Retired Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Nachura said there should be separate voting.Puno’s committee, on the President’s request, revised the transitory provisions of the draft federal charter to cut the terms of the President and Vice President Leni Robredo, bar them from seeking reelection in 2022, and authorize elections for the selection of a transitional president and transitional vice president.But at Tuesday’s Senate hearing, University of the Philippines professor Gene Pilapil slammed the revision as a “reverse power grab” or “impeachment by a new constitution.”Pilapil said the “stunt” was retrogressive, as it undermines the mandate of the 16 million Filipinos who voted for Mr. Duterte and the 14 million who voted for Robredo.Marcos for president?Former Chief Justice Hilario Davide also criticized the revision, which does not bar Mr. Duterte from running for transitional president.Davide said he believed the President would choose former Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as his running mate and they would surely win.Marcos would then be able to run for President in the federal government, Davide said.",1
" Muslim and Christian evacuees from the strife-torn city of Marawi on Sunday celebrated Eid al-Fitr at the close of the holy fasting month of Ramadan with fried fish and roast calf, thanks to President Rodrigo Duterte, and roses from their Catholic friends.As early as Saturday evening, Tarhata Mustari, 23, knew that meals for her three children at the evacuation center in Iligan School of Fisheries would not be the usual sardines and instant noodles.“There was this slaughtered large cow that volunteers had brought in on Saturday evening. They said it would be roasted for the Eid feast,” Mustari said.But Mustari said she had no idea that Christian evacuees had prepared something for her and the other Muslim evacuees.EmotionalMuslim women were in tears when they received the roses.“That was so unexpected,” Mustari said. “Of course, I was emotional, I was deeply touched,” Nariman said.Sarah Romapa, 49, of Barangay Marinaut, said she tightly hugged the Christian woman who gave her the rose.“We cried together,” she said.Henry Zamora, 26, said Christian evacuees discussed what gifts they could give to the Muslims.“We do not have money to buy them gifts so we thought of expressing our solidarity for the Eid through the simplest form — flowers,” Zamora said.He said camp team leaders arranged for the purchase of flowers. “What we agreed among ourselves was to let our wives hand the flowers to the Muslim women after the Eid prayer,” Zamora said.“This is also our way of showing them that despite what happened, we Christians are not angry with them. That we are all in this together. In fact, we share the same evacuation center, and most of the time, we eat together,” he added.Together, the evacuees feasted on the food that was prepared for them — including fried fish and the roast calf, which was bought from the P91,000 that President Duterte had given during his visit last week.“We’re happy because we still celebrated Eid. We’re sad though because we did it inside the evacuation center,” Mustari said.She said she wished the war was over so they could return home. “That’s what I have been praying to Allah,” she said.Morning prayerIn other evacuation centers, emotions also ran high on Eid as Muslims listened to the “khutba” delivered by imams.At the City Hall grounds here, where dozens of Maranaos attended the Eid prayer, people were seen weeping as Imam Maulana Mamotoc delivered his sermon.Mamotoc called on the people of Marawi not to lose hope, adding that Allah would provide them the necessary things they needed once they returned home after the war.In a statement marking the Eid celebration, President Duterte called for national unity even as the fighting entered its second month.“Let us channel our energies toward fostering national unity — because dedicating our lives to the betterment of humanity is the best way to demonstrate our devotion to God,” he said.“May this renewed sense of spiritual accomplishment give you the strength and courage to cultivate communities. In time when all odds seem stacked against us, it is our willpower and faith that will always see us through,” he added.Peace, unityIn press statements, senators called for unity among Muslim and Christian communities.“After a month of fasting, introspection and quest of faith, let the occasion of Eid al-Fitr serve as a symbol of our collective pursuit [of] peace and unity, especially at this time when our solidarity as a nation is being put to test with the fighting in Marawi City,” Sen. Grace Poe said.Sen. Francis Pangilinan said: “At this time, we hope people know and give importance to cooperation, respect for others and helping each other in a time when our unity as a nation is undergoing a big challenge.”",1
"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has lashed out at the “hypocrisy” of the West for closing borders to an exodus of refugees whom he said he would welcome to his country until it was “filled to the brim”.Commenting on the refugee exodus that has plagued Europe, Duterte said Western countries had failed those most in need and the Philippines, a developing country of 100 million, was willing to take them in.“They can always come here, and will be welcome here,” he said.“It’s all right. We will survive. I say send them to us. We will accept them. We will accept them. They are human beings.”In a collateral move, Duterte also announced that his administration will offer refugee status to all Filipino Americans trying to flee Donald Trump’s presidency.The election of Trump has prompted many Americans to plan their exodus to Canada, Europe and Asia.“There will be no questions asked,” Duterte said. “All that Filipino Americans need to do is to renounce their U.S. citizenship and come to the Philippines. He made it clear that his refugee status offer is open to all, including the FilAms who have been very critical of his administration.“Blood is thicker than politics,” Duterte added.",0
"Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara on Thursday said he expects that passage of various bills that seek to update provisions in the Local Government Code would help empower local government units (LGUs) to effectively combat crimes and illegal drugs within their communities to ensure public safety and order.Angara, chair of the Senate committee on local government, made the assurance in light of President Rodrigo Duterte’s order to the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to conduct a performance audit of all LGUs’ anti-illegal drugs and anti-crime operations.“While the audit is on-going, we, at the Senate, are working to make sure that LGUs would have sufficient autonomy, power and funds to fight criminality and illegal drugs,” Angara said.The Senate panel has been conducting public consultations in reviewing the Local Government Code (LGC) under Republic Act 7160, which remained unchanged since its enactment in 1991. He was able to file 11 bills that seek to reform the LGC as a result of the consultations.Angara said one of the measures he filed, Senate Bill 1788 seeks to increase the source of funds given to LGUs by including in the computation of internal revenue allotment (IRA) the value-added tax (VAT) paid on imported goods collected by the Bureau of Customs (BoC).He also filed Senate Bill No. 1770 that seeks to enhance public financial management in LGUs by requiring them to post in their websites the summary of all revenues, collection, and disbursement of LGU funds to improve transparency and good governance.Senators Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III and Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto have also filed bills that seek to increase the IRA of LGUs from the current 40 percent to 50 percent share.Once passed into law, Angara said these measures will enable LGUs to effectively perform their duties as front liners to their constituents. He said data from the Liga ng mga Barangay shows that 40 percent of 41,902 barangays receive an IRA of P1 million or less.“During our consultations, there are local governments that do not have sufficient funds to implement their programs supposedly for the benefit of their constituents,” Angara pointed out.“LGUs serve as the first line of defense against drug menace. They are the ones who know who are the drug pushers within their locality. They are also the ones who know if there are drug addicts who were not given attention and rehabilitation,” he said.“People’s funds should flow back to their local governments so that more can be channeled into projects and services that serve their benefit and uplift their welfare,” Angara stressed.",1
"What’s in a name? Is the national animal, which goes by the name “kalabaw,” synonymous to the carabao and the water buffalo?To the scientific world, a carabao is a water buffalo—the sort that lives in tropical swampland.But for many farmers, the carabao or kalabaw in the vernacular is the country’s native farm help while the buffalo is a purebred import that they use to crossbreed livestock for milk or meat.Getting the names right is important to the government, which promotes carabao development in the country, Dr. Arnel del Barrio, executive director of the Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) here, said during a program on the 22nd founding anniversary of the agency on Friday.Del Barrio said the debate had fueled public confusion. In the burgeoning carabao-based industries, the market offers “gatas ng kalabaw” (carabao milk) alongside “gatas ng buffalo” (buffalo milk) and “karne ng kalabaw” (carabao meat), he said.The name carabao may have roots in “kerbau,” the Malaysian and Indonesian name for the buffalo. Kerbau is also a Visayan or Cebuano term.Common term“We agreed to promote only one term, kalabaw in Tagalog or carabao in English,” Del Barrio told reporters here.For years, kalabaw has been the common term for the farm animal. The confusion began when the Philippine Carabao Act of 1992 (Republic Act No. 7307) was enacted, requiring the enforcement of the Carabao Development Program.The program highlights the need to upgrade the breed of carabaos through crossbreeding with river buffalos to produce buffalos more suited for the dairy and meat industries.Learn to differentiateSoon, farmers were tending to the hulking, dark-colored and flared-horned animals, which were imported and which they learned to differentiate from carabaos by referring to them exclusively as buffalos.According to the PCC, the carabao is one of three types of Asian buffalos. The two others are the “tamaraw,” the country’s pride, which thrives on Mindoro island, and the Indian wild buffalo, which has been domesticated and has also found its way to the Philippines.RELATED STORIESMake no mistake, Guyito IS a carabao – and he talksCarabao population on decline; lawmakers want to know whyCarabao goes wild in Cubao",1
"Police operatives arrested recently in Umingan, Pangasinan a suspected gun-for-hire and the woman who allegedly financed the group that carried out the killing of Mayor Julian Resuello of San Carlos City, Pangasinan and his bodyguard in 2007.Chief Inspector Jose Abaya, Umingan chief of police, identified the arrested as Loida Mendoza whom he tagged as the leader of the Gonzales Group of hired killers as well as financier of the Pogito Gun-for-Hire Group; and John Gumagaco, formerly a member of the Gonzales Group.Mendoza was arrested at noon last Tuesday by joint elements of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) and Umingan Municipal Police Station (MPS) on Rizal Street, Barangay Poblacion East, Umingan.A dual citizen, Mendoza had long been staying abroad and when she returned, a warrant for her arrest was issued in connection with the double murder charges she is facing before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 57, presided by Judge Jaime Dojillo Jr.Gumagaco, on the other hand, was arrested last Wednesday in Barangay Luna West, also in Umingan. He was a member of Mendoza’s gun-for-hire group, but has been recently identified by the Lupao Municipal Police Station (LPS) as a member of the Ignacio Gun-for-Hire Group, said Abaya.The case stems from the gunning down of Mayor Resuello and his bodyguard as they left the San Carlos City auditorium during the fiesta celebration in April, 2007.",1
"THE TWO sides stepped back from the brink on Sunday, keeping the door open for a ceasefire, possibly a negotiated truce the next time around.President Duterte lifted the unilateral truce with the communist New People’s Army (NPA) on Saturday evening, six days after a ceasefire was declared as a goodwill gesture ahead of formal peace negotiations in Oslo, Norway, next month.The move came after the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the umbrella organization for the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the NPA, failed to respond to a deadline to reciprocate the government’s declaration.“We may work out a negotiated truce with the communists,” said Jesus Dureza, presidential peace adviser. “It was in our agenda when the formal peace talks resume in Oslo. The peace talks will go on as scheduled.”“I am ready for any effort to pave the way and move the peace negotiations forward,” CPP founder Jose Maria Sison said in an online interview with the Inquirer on Sunday from his exile home in the Netherlands.“Although there is no longer a Duterte unilateral ceasefire to reciprocate, the CPP can still decide to issue a unilateral ceasefire order,” Sison said.He said this would take effect “only upon reciprocation by the [government] or [President] Duterte and upon the fulfillment of certain considerations, like ensuring ceasefire by the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) and PNP (Philippine National Police) and their armed auxiliaries and the release of all political prisoners through amnesty.”‘Peace saboteurs’Sison hinted that “peace saboteurs” in the Duterte administration had wanted to prevent the release of political prisoners and also to put the NDFP in a bad light. He did not identify them, though.The peace talks, brokered by Norway, will resume on Aug. 20, four years after bogging down due to the NDFP demand that 500 political prisoners be released. The Duterte administration has given its promise to free them for health and humanitarian reasons.Dureza said he welcomed the statement from Sison, who told a local TV interviewer hours after Duterte withdrew the ceasefire that the communists had also intended to impose a truce but it was overtaken by events.High alert“This is what we have been waiting for,” Dureza said in an official statement. “The leadership of the CPP/NPA/NDFP announced through the media its belated but still strategic and awaited decision to also declare its own unilateral ceasefire.”Mr. Duterte was also angered by reports that NPA rebels had killed a militiaman and wounded four others in an ambush on Wednesday as they were returning to an Army base in Davao del Norte to comply with the government’s unilateral truce.On Saturday night, he recalled his ceasefire order after a 5 p.m. deadline he had set passed without a response from communist leaders.After the revocation, the President ordered the AFP and the PNP to resume combat operations against threats to national security.The PNP chief, Director General Ronald dela Rosa, on Sunday directed the lifting “effective immediately” of the suspension of police operations and told troops to be “on high alert and continue to discharge their normal functions and mandate to neutralize all threats to national security.”Normal mandateOn Saturday, Gen. Ricardo Visaya, AFP chief of staff, ordered “all our forces to resume their normal mandate tasks and work to neutralize all threats to national security, protect the citizenry, enforce the laws and maintain peace in the land.”The AFP public affairs chief, Col. Edgard Arevalo, said before the President’s revocation of the ceasefire that the Philippine Army had completed the pullout of the 2nd Special Forces Battalion from San Miguel, Surigao del Sur province, on Visaya’s orders.He reiterated that Citizens Armed Force Geographical Unit (Cafgu) forces were pulling out in Kapalong town, Davao del Norte province, on Wednesday when they were attacked by the NPA.Extra mile for peace“The pullout was in compliance with the President’s directive to step back from the operational area where there are likely armed engagement between government security forces and members of the communist forces,” Arevalo said.In a statement on Sunday, Dureza defended the President’s decision to end the short-lived suspension of hostilities against the Moist insurgents.“It is very clear that the President walked the extra mile for peace. And no doubt, he will still continue to do so at any given opportunity,” he said.Cabinet meetingWithout providing details, Dureza said he would recommend the government’s appropriate response to the President and the members of the Cabinet during their scheduled meeting in Malacañang today.In an earlier interview over ABS-CBN News Channel, Sison called Mr. Duterte, his former student, a “bully” for compelling the NPA to bow to his call for peace within the period the President had set.Sison, who had expressed his intention to return home from Utrecht amid the Duterte administration’s openness to broker a peace agreement with the CPP, said the President’s behavior was “thuggish.”“If he doesn’t want peace, so be it,” said the 77-year-old Sison, who has been seeking to overthrow the government for over four decades.

"The Sandiganbayan’s Special Second Division has acquitted Jonathan Malaya, former Baguio Teacher’s Camp officer-in-charge superintendent in a graft case filed against him over approval of a recommendation to award two construction projects to a contractor in 2008 for improvement of the camp’s facilities.Malaya, who was an assistant secretary of the Department of Education at the time, was charged for approving the Bids and Awards Committee’s (BAC) recommendation to award the projects to Nicholas Jift Construction despite its alleged disqualification for submitting a personal check, which supposedly was not an acceptable bid security.“However, a scrutiny of the evidence presented by the prosecution shows that the allegation that accused Malaya acted with evident partiality is untenable. From the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the exhibits formally offered, there is simply no evidence or even signs and indications of bias when accused approved BAC Resolution No. 09-08,” the court said in a 17-page decision promulgated on December 5.It was referring to a resolution, which stated that the BAC decided to consider as acceptable bid security the personal check submitted by Nicholas Jift Construction as well as the surety bond of another bidder.Nicholas Jift Construction later emerged as the lowest, qualifying bidder among the three bidders.According to the charge sheet, the projects—which had a total contract price of P17.16 million —pertained to the “[c]onstruction of amphitheater and landscaping around it and in front of Albert Hall” and to the “[l]andscaping of Teacher’s Camp major road with two (2) rotundas and three (3) parking areas.”The court said Malaya “immediately reviewed” the supporting documents, including the consultants’ report which “stated that there were no irregularities in the bidding,” when he received the resolution that was unanimously approved by the BAC members.“These are enough indicia for a prudent man to believe that the procedure laid down in [Republic Act] 9184, the procurement law effective at the time material to this case, was substantially complied with. In other words, as hoPe, accused performed the task required of him—i.e., review the BAC resolution forwarded to him, together with all its supporting documents, and seeing no irregularity, approved the same. And because the actions of the accused were consistent and within the bounds of law, this court, could not see any indications of bias or partiality,” according to the Sandiganbayan.It said “ill will or intent to cause damage could not be imputed from such actions.”HoPe is Head of the Procuring Entity.Republic Act (RA) 9184 is the Government Procurement Reform Act.Malaya “could also not be considered to be grossly negligent” in approving the BAC resolution, the court further said as it pointed out that he reviewed the provisions and the attached documents.It added that he “had every right to rely on the averments found in the BAC Resolution and the report of the procurement consultant. He is not expected to supervise the procurement process, redo the procurement process or investigate when the resolution is brought to him for approval, especially when there are no complaints or protests filed questioning the bidding process.”The court also found that the award of the projects to Nicholas Jift Construction and Malaya’s approval did not constitute as unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference.“Nicholas Jift was awarded the contracts or became the preferred contractor to perform the works bidded out after following the correct procurement procedure pursuant to the prevailing procurement law and its implementing rules and regulations,” it said.“Wherefore, premises considered, the court hereby finds accused Jonathan E. Malaya not guilty of violation of Section 3, par. e, RA 3019 and hereby acquits him of the charges,” the court ruled, referring to the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (RA 3019).Associate Justice Samuel Martires, who leads the court’s Second Division, penned the ruling, which was concurred in by Associate Justices Michael Frederick Musngi and Geraldine Faith Econg.",1
" President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday complained that he had emerged as the bad boy in the war on drugs because of what he said was his desire to save the country’s youth from the evils of illegal drugs.Speaking at the 25th anniversary of preschool, Center for Brighter Beginnings here which dozens of children had attended, the President said he wanted only “the good people to roam this Earth.”But because of his fight against illegal drugs, Duterte said he was now being painted as the bad guy.“Others were saying I am a bad boy because I hurt bad people. Others even say I send (bad people) to heaven, that’s why (I am bad),” the President said.But he said what he was doing was to make sure that children would have a bright future.“Do you know children why I get angry even on TV? Because those bad people, I don’t want them in this world. I want them gone so that nobody will disturb your life anymore,” he added.“I want you to grow in peace, no trouble, no thieves, no kidnappers. Nothing of this sort (of problems),” the President said.One objectiveHe said the only reason he became President was because of the youth of the land.“It’s my job to protect you and our society. If you see that everything is working, functional, and there are no more problems, it would be OK already. We’re finished there,” Duterte said.He said his decision to address the drug problem—starting from his stint as mayor — had proven to be correct despite the criticisms hurled against him.Duterte said even President Donald Trump had recently found how dangerous drug addiction was.“Before I left, I was viewing CNN. Trump had declared a national emergency because of drugs. I told you so,” he said.Trump declared opioid abuse a national public health emergency and announced new steps to combat what he described as the worst drug crisis in US history.“It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction,” he said. “We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic,” said Trump.Duterte’s pain killerDeaths in the US have surged from opioids, which include some prescribed painkillers, heroin and synthetic drugs like fentanyl, often sold on the nation’s streets.Mr. Duterte, who had admitted taking fentanyl as pain killer, recounted that the US government then, under President Barack Obama, had investigated his war on drugs.“I said before when Obama was investigating that one day, to your sorrow. Now look. They just declared. I just listened,” he said.“Now, what? It’s my turn to ask, what now? And so, America. It was your idol before. Now look. So what’s happening to America? It is in total disorder,” he said.Duterte said he had been saying that time will come the US would realize the need to seriously combat drugs.“I saw it a long time ago. I was still mayor and I already saw the devastation that it would cause,” he said.Duterte also downplayed criticisms of EJKs, saying he never ordered any criminal to be killed.“We bleed. I know that killing is unlawful. But my order really to the police is go out and hunt for them. Arrest them if it is still possible,” he said.",1
"The country’s largest sugar refinery is expected to finish the construction of its 64-megawatt biomass plant this year.The Biomass Cogeneration Project of the Victorias Milling Company (VMC) in Victorias City, Negros Occidental will be finished this year. It is designed to produce power for the refinery and also export to the power grid, VMC Chief Operating Officer Minnie Chua said Saturday.The plant will be built in the 200-hectare VMC headquarters and will run mainly on bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane after being processed to extract sugar.In an interview, Chua said the renewable energy plant is expected to run by October or November.Chua said around 25 MW of its generated power will be exported to the power grid, but since the grid is congested, it will have to be upgraded first by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines.With the new source of power for the company, Chua said sugar could be milled year round.“Whole year operations are possible with this cogeneration project but we also need to do repairs on our milling equipment to ensure that no breakdowns will happen,” she said.VMC also opened milling operations last September 20 together with the other two sugar centrals in the province.Chua assured that their mills are running at maximum capacity, which is 15,000 to 16,000 tons of sugar a day.“We are doing everything and our best to support our sugar planters who are also our partners despite the current situation,” Chua said.",1
"President Duterte will reveal more names of narco-politicians in Central Luzon, Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa warned yesterday.Speaking at the 116th Police Service Anniversary celebration, here, the Philippine National Police (PNP) chief said he will stop short of naming names, but said officials linked to illegal drugs included five congressmen, five mayors, and a vice governor.“Nasa process pa ng validation ngayon para hindi magmintis, pero bahala na si President magbanggit ng mga pangalan nila (It’s in the process of validation to avoid mistake, but the President will take care of naming them),” Dela Rosa said.Asked to clarify if these officials are all incumbents, he said in Filipino that “some of them are.”Earlier this month, Duterte disclosed names of politicians, members of the judiciary and law enforcers allegedly linked to illegal drugs. Two of those named or renamed in Central Luzon were an incumbent mayor in Bulacan and a former mayor in Pampanga.Meanwhile, the PNP chief called on the public to support the government’s campaign against illegal gambling even as he admitted that there are “untouchables” involved in the operation of illegal vices, particularly in Central Luzon.He said that illegal numbers game particularly “jueteng” still exists in many parts of the country, with some operators apparently using the Small Town Lottery (STL) as a front for these illegal activities.“Kailangan paigtingin pa natin ang kampanya sa illegal gambling. Dapat maging sincere din ang ating kapulisan sa pagsugpo nito at yung mga operators na lumabag ay kailangan arestuhin agad (We need to intensify the campaign against illegal gambling. Our police must be sincere in doing so and operators who are defiant must be arrested immediately),” Dela Rosa said.",1
"One down. Sixty-three to go.The government has to hunt down not only Basit Usman but more than 60 other bomb experts after taking down international terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias “Marwan.”Documents obtained by the Inquirer, including one stamped with the logo of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and marked confidential and “Special Operation Group (SOG) bomb experts,” showed that Marwan had 63 associates, all trained by Indonesian bomb expert Dulmatin, who was killed by police in Jakarta in 2010.Dulmatin was a senior figure in the Indonesia-based terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah who was one of the brains behind the bombings of two nightclubs on the resort island of Bali that killed 202 people, mostly Australian tourists, and wounded 209 others, mostly foreign tourists, on Oct. 12, 2002.Attack on PH envoyHe also took part in the Jemaah Islamiyah car-bomb attack on Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia Leonides Caday in Jakarta on Aug. 1, 2000.Caday was injured in the explosion. Two people were killed and 21 others injured in the midday attack in Jakarta’s Menteng district.Dulmatin was killed by officers from Indonesia’s counterterrorism police in a raid on his hideout on the outskirts of Jakarta on March 9, 2010.The MILF list of SOG bomb experts is topped by Marwan, who was killed by commandos from the Special Action Force (SAF) of the Philippine National Police in Mamasapano town, Maguindanao province, on Jan. 25.The list, dated June 28, 2008, is signed by one Jamir M. Bansil. It contains the names of 38 bomb makers.A second list, dated Aug. 2, 2008, contains the names of 26 bomb experts.Usman is third on the first list. A Filipino bomb maker for the local terrorist group Abu Sayyaf, Usman escaped from the SAF commandos, who lost 44 of their own in gun battles with guerrillas from the MILF and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters.President Aquino, under heavy public criticism for the deaths of the policemen, demanded that the MILF, which signed a peace agreement with the government in March last year, to surrender Usman, if they had him, or help the government find him or step aside to allow government security forces to get him.The United States has offered a $3-million reward for the capture of Usman.Extortionists’ groupOn the list is Abdul Jabedi Bedz, a leader of the local terrorist group Al-Khobar, which authorities say is behind a series of bombings in Central Mindanao that started two years before the list was made.More than 30 people have been killed in those bombings.Based in the marshlands of Maguindanao, Al-Khobar is a group of extortionists who use bombs to scare businessmen into paying up, according to authorities.Authorities say Al-Khobar was formed in support of Jemaah Islamiyah and foreign jihadist groups.The government is offering a P3.3-million reward for information that would lead to Bedz’s arrest.The list shows that some of the bomb experts are also assigned as organizers, logistics and supply officers.Some of the people on the list are described as “instructor for jihad and bombs.”Several of the people listed as organizers are linked to Al-Khobar.The list includes the aliases of the bomb experts, including Zulkifli’s, which is the same as the alias Marwan that appears on the US Federal Bureau of Investigation’s list of most wanted terrorists.MILF informantThe Inquirer obtained the documents from a source who claimed he got the papers from an MILF informant in exchange for “some consideration.”“These documents show that the MILF had been using the expertise of Marwan and the others as early as 10 years ago,” the source said.The source said Dulmatin trained the 64 men on the list in bomb-making.“They were the core group that also trained others,” the source said.He said the training included making improvised explosive devices using locally available materials.Marwan’s studentsThe military is verifying reports that Marwan trained 300 people, including female fighters, not only in bomb-making but also in using guns.“We received information that some of the students are hiding in Mamasapano and nearby areas, and are constantly on the move. But we are still validating this,” said Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc, chief of the public affairs office of Armed Forces of the Philippines.Cabunoc asked the public to help in monitoring Marwan’s students because the military has no list of their names.“We have seen the evil effects of bombing, especially on defenseless civilians,” Cabunoc said, adding that knowledge of bomb-making is dangerous in the hands of radical, angry civilians.“That is very serious. If someone knows how to make a bomb, anyone can be a victim,” he said.Cabunoc said the military had asked the MILF for help in hunting down terrorists like Usman, and that it was one way for the rebels to prove themselves serious in pursuing the peace process despite the Mamasapano incident.“If the MILF themselves turn over the terrorist to us, then trust might be restored. They should prove that they are worth trusting and believing,” Cabunoc said.–",1
"The surprise drug test (SDT) for public elementary school teachers here has been temporarily put on hold, according to a Department of Education (DepEd) official.Danilo Gudelosao, DepEd – Cebu City Division Assistant Schools Division Superintendent, said the lack of clear guidelines prompted the temporary suspension.He added that it was also meant to give way for their central office to refine the guiding principles.“We have temporarily suspended the drug testing (for public school teachers) because we would want to make things clear, especially that the head office is still finalizing the guidelines,” he said.However, Gudelosao emphasized that this does not mean that the random drug testing will not resume, saying a government employee is required to undergo the screening.The SDT, which started in September this year, has already conducted the tests on more than 200 out of the city’s 5,500 public school teachers.At least 255 teachers and non-teaching personnel from 12 public schools have undergone the tests since the initiative was launched.The teachers are from the following schools: Regino Mercado Elementary School, Regino Mercado Night High School, Alaska Mambaling Elementary School (AMES), Alaska Mambaling Night High School, Cantipla Integrated School, Tabunan Integrated School, Tagbao Elementary School, Tagbao-National School, Paril Elementary School, Paril National High School, Cambinocot Elementary School, and Cambinocot High School.The results showed that no one was found positive of illegal drug use. Only a male teacher at AMES reportedly refused to undergo the test instituted by the City Office of Substance Abuse Prevention because he was “sick.”The drug testing is mandated by DepEd Order No. 37 series of 2017 or the Deped Drug-Free Workplace Policy which was promulgated last July 31.Mayor Tomas Osmeña, in a seperate interview, said the lack of clear guidelines is not enough reason for the city government to discontinue the drug screenings among public school teachers.“If there’s a lousy teacher maybe because he’s on drugs, (it’s) the students (who) will suffer. Are they concerned of the welfare of the teachers or the welfare of the students? The worst thing that can happen is when the students don’t benefit from education because the teacher is a drunkard, a drug user,” the mayor said.Meanwhile, City Councilor Joy Augustus Young, who is also the deputy mayor for education matters, has asked the City Legal Office for a legal opinion on the city government’s legal basis to resume the SDTs.“It is laid down in the Local Government Code that the city can hold a drug test even if DepEd would say it should be put off. But I want to make sure that we have a legal basis for that before we can proceed,” Young said.",1
"Four officials of the Commission on Audit (COA), including a now retired commissioner and state auditors, did not only look the other way but also helped officials of National Agribusiness Corp. (Nabcor) go around adverse reports involving spurious liquidation papers in exchange for cash and gifts, according to witnesses in the new P500-million pork barrel scam case.The witnesses, former employees of Nabcor, told the Inquirer in separate interviews they had personal knowledge that former COA Commissioner Juanito Espino Jr., former Director Tito Nabua and state auditors Herminia Aquino and Carmelita Sanchez benefited from Nabcor through its president, Alan Javellana.The Inquirer asked the COA public information office on Friday for comment. It said Espino and Nabua retired in 2013 and that Aquino died earlier this year. It had no information about Sanchez.Javellana, one of the accused in the P10-billion pork barrel scam allegedly orchestrated by businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles, could not be contacted for comment.The witnesses also said that the implementation of projects financed with legislators’ shares of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) through Nabcor was marred with irregularities with the imprimatur of Javellana.“Every year from 2008 to 2010, audit observation memoranda for fiscal years 2007-2009 were received by Nabcor with discovered irregularities. However, Nabcor merely sent reports to the COA saying it would comply with the audit observations,” witnesses Vic Cacal and Rhodora Mendoza said in a joint statement submitted to the Office of the Ombudsman by their lawyer, Levito Baligod.“Mr. Javellana blatantly disregarded rules and regulations and allowed the malversation of the PDAF because of his connections with certain officials of the COA,” the witnesses said.“True enough, DA-COA had regularly issued credit notices to Nabcor to clear the latter’s payments to NGOs (nongovernment organizations) even if no supporting documents were submitted,” they said.Cacal and Mendoza said the COA officials “assisted and coached [us] how to go around adverse audit observations that would result in the issuance of credit notices clearing Nabcor payments to NGOs even without sufficient documents.”The witnesses said they knew about the irregularities because of their positions at Nabcor: Cacal was head of the general services department and Mendoza was vice president for finance.BribesMendoza and Cacal narrated how the COA officials received bribes in exchange for their assistance in going around questionable liquidations of NGOs and issuance of clear credit notices.“GM (referring to Espino) meets directly with Javellana apart from being a recipient of one lot of Saanen Breed goats that I facilitated,” Cacal said in an interview.At that time, a Saanen Breed goat cost around P10,000 and one lot consisted of 10 goats, he said.“Nabua was the beneficiary of a P15-million loan from an Acef (Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund) funded project and was the one who coached us how to remedy adverse findings by auditors,” Mendoza said in a separate interview.“Based on our records, Nabua did not pay a centavo for his loan for a project in San Fabian, Pangasinan,” she said.Car for AquinoMendoza also said that Aquino, being the supervising auditor, received “a car under her son’s name but the monthly amortization was paid by Nabcor through Javellana.”She added that she knew about the gift because it was she who purchased the car and she arranged for a parking allocation for it at the Nabcor office at Tektite Towers.“She (Aquino) was given a car through speedway electronics and was always given allowances when she traveled abroad,” Mendoza said.She added that Aquino remained the supervising auditor of Nabcor even after she was assigned as auditor of the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA).According to Mendoza, Sanchez “facilitated the sale of a lot in Tagaytay, which was bought by Javellana in exchange for not releasing the special audit report.”In a telephone interview, Cacal said that in 2009 he was asked by Javellana to accompany him to a meeting with some high-ranking COA officials so “that I could address my questions to [them] regarding how to remedy the audit observations on the liquidation of the PDAF of certain legislators.”“Javellana introduced me to Espino and another auditor in a restaurant near SM Fairview where I was prompted to state questions regarding negative audit observations of the liquidations submitted by the NGOs,” Cacal said.“The COA officials instead of answering any of my questions just told me to receive the documents submitted by the NGOs and not to validate them anymore. They said that what was important was that the documentary requirements appeared to be complete and they would take care of the rest,” Cacal said.Remedial measuresSince then, Cacal said he, on Javellana’s orders, “frequently met with the COA officials to purposely discuss remedial measures in the audit observations concerning Nabcor.”He added that whenever he and Mendoza brought to Javellana’s attention the liquidation papers of the NGOs, which were “manufactured and contained highly questionable names of beneficiaries,” but Javellana told them to just follow the instructions of the COA officials.“The goods or merchandise submitted by the NGO for inspection by Nabcor prior to delivery is the same merchandise submitted for inspection by the same NGO in other PDAF-funded projects. The NGO would only change the tarpaulin to fit a particular project. The NGO takes pictures reflecting different tarpaulins to show that these goods are for different projects,” Cacal and Mendoza said in their joint statement.RELATED STORIESP5B coursed through Nabcor could be used as new plunder case, says lawyer83 lawmakers tied to agri pork racketLiquidation of Nabcor funds came too early",1
"All they need to do was cooperate with authorities, and these drug users will get a shot at redemption.In Maguindanao, two towns are adopting “tokhangers,” or drug dependents who surrendered and have undergone rehabilitation, into their respective pool of workers in different economic livelihood projects in a bid to reintegrate them to society.As of last month, at least 12,775 residents across Maguindanao have surrendered through Oplan “Tokhang,” according to government authorities.Mayor Abdulkarim Langkuno of Paglat town has tapped more than 100 such “Tokhangers” as caretakers in the hectares of fishponds the town is managing within the 220,000-hectare Liguasan Marsh.“Masaya silang nagpakatino ngayon dahil kumikita na sila habang may respeto ang ibang tao sa kanila (They are glad to have turned a new leaf, they are now earning while gaining the respect of the people),” said mayor Langkuno, a former Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) commander.In Rajah Buayan town, Mayor Zamzamin Ampatuan said an initial two-hectare bamboo-seeding nursery may soon be tended by dozens of former drug users.The nursery farm was launched with a P21-million initial fund given last week by Environment and Natural Resources Sec. Gina Lopez to develop the resource-rich Liguasan Marsh, said to be Asia’s largest.“We can include in the initial workforce some of our residents duly certified as graduates in drug users’ rehabilitation process…We believe they are human beings like us who deserve a second chance in life,” Ampatuan said.Maguindanao Gov. Esmael Mangudadatu said he was hoping that the projects initiated in Paglat and Rajah Buayan will be replicated in the 34 other towns of the province.",1
"VOWING an intensified campaign against illegal drugs, President Duterte on Monday said he was considering putting up a P2-million bounty on every policeman coddling drug syndicates, urging other police officials to reveal the activities of the so-called “ninja cops.”Mr. Duterte railed against critics who had complained that the poor who trade drugs to make a living were being targeted by the police, but added that military generals, city mayors, governors and police officials involved in the drug trade must also be stopped.“I consider the fight against drugs a war, there is a crisis in this country, it is drugs … it has infected every nook and corner,” Mr. Duterte said in a National Heroes’ Day speech at Libingan ng mga Bayani before retired and active soldiers, government officials and foreign diplomats.Singling out corrupt policemen known as “ninjas,” who take payoffs from drug lords, Duterte said he was placing a P2-million bounty on each rogue official, telling their colleagues to “squeal on your friends.”Mr. Duterte last month named about 160 government officials, judges, policemen and soldiers who he said were protecting drug traffickers or selling drugs in their communities.Police figures show that more than 1,900 people have been killed since Mr. Duterte came to power two months ago, promising to eliminate the narcotics scourge that he said had affected 3.7 million Filipinos.Police say the death toll of about 36 people a day is a result of drug dealers resisting arrest or gang feuds.The United States said last week it was “deeply concerned” about the reports of extrajudicial drug killings and it urged the Duterte administration to ensure that law enforcement efforts “comply with its human rights obligation.”This month, two UN human rights experts urged Manila to stop the extrajudicial executions and killings. Mr. Duterte responded by threatening to leave the United Nations.RelentlessIn his nationally televised speech on Monday, the President scoffed at accusations that he was trampling on human rights and said law enforcers should not worry about criminal liability while acting on his campaign.“I will not relent. The campaign will be continuous and I will be … harsh as I can ever be,” he said in his 40-minute speech. “I am declaring war. I am not ordering the police to just (do) a few punitive action.”Unless the problem is eliminated, he said, the Philippines might “end up like the South American countries and their fractured governments.”Mr. Duterte lamented that many Filipinos still failed to recognize the enormity of the drug problem.He said the proliferation of narcotics was just one of “many things that place us at a disadvantage now” and caused “disorder and disturb the peace.”Drug crisisSaid the President: “We have a drug crisis that some of our fellow citizens consider just a police problem. It even went to the extent that it is an ailment and that because it’s an ailment, the punitive action of the police should not take place.”“I am sorry for my country for there are citizens (who) really fall short of grasping a situation here,” he added.The President called on soldiers and policemen to “destroy the apparatus” of the illegal drug trade.“You will have my support. You will have all the things that you need to fight criminals. Do not worry. In the pursuit of law and order pursuant to my directions, you do not have to worry about criminal liability,” he said. “I take full legal responsibility.”As for the crooked government officials, he said: “There will be a day of comeuppance. There will always be a day of reckoning.”Bold initiativeThe Philippine National Police welcomed Mr. Duterte’s proposed bounty.“We see this as a bold initiative to once and for all rid the organization of errant personnel who are in cahoots with drug syndicates,” said Chief Supt. Dionardo Carlos, the PNP spokesperson.“We are fully aware of the alarming drug situation in the country such that we are giving this national campaign against drugs our complete and unqualified support,” he said.Carlos said any information to be provided would be treated as confidential and would undergo rigid validation. He said the information can be sent through the PNP Text Hotline 09178475757 which is available 2",1
"formulated in 2011 would be realized in 2016. The 2016 outcomes speak for themselves. The color code used for reporting on outcome flashed an “all green” report.Beyond having clear core values and a lofty mission, what ways did the Santos family follow to come up with such a performance report after 5 years? The answer: The ways are not altogether secret: they are no different from the usual ways of ensuring that the spouses positively bring a positive contribution to the family each day; that spouse-to-spouse relationships are kept healthy; and that relationships with each of the kids (and among the kids) are kept always on a friendly footing. In practice, what do all these mean?Based on the narrative of the dad, the Santos family adopted a few “projects” for the family to undertake during the 5-year period, 2011-2016. These are: project excellence (do excellently at school and at work); strengthening family traditions (dinner, playing Settlers of Catan – a favorite board game of the family, and having periodic family councils); preparation for the next level of schooling (from grade school to high school, from high school to college, and then graduate school); acquisition and practice of household skills (the kids gradually do more and more of the home chores); and finally learning of Spanish (in preparation for a trip to Mexico in 2016). It is never enough to specify projects; it is also absolutely necessary to specify a strategy map, which is translated into a set of performance scorecards.The Santos’ family strategy map is of special interest. It has three headlines, which capture the strategic themes that the family projects must serve. Those themes have been articulated as: Build character;best effort always; and do what we ought. And this is where the not-so-secret ways of the Santos family get to be fully revealed.At bottom, they put a lot of attention and effort to building and strengthening the family culture. This means in even more specific terms: spending a lot of rich time with each other; going to Mass on Sunday as a family and having Sunday lunch together; and holding a quarterly “family council” to reinforce the family traditions.Then comes “learning and growth” especially on the part of the kids: a lot of study, combined with doing household chores. There is also some writing (of a personal journal and of letters to each other in the family), plus tutoring of each other (and others beyond the family). All these are not enough. They need to be complemented with “resource capability priorities” such as: “steady money” (job for the dad, and savings); “guard time” (an expression for not wasting time and using time well, concretized in no TV and no video games); “keep healthy” (this is where exercise comes in along with healthy food); then the two absolute “musts”, which are: “track and review performance”; and “seeking God’s help” (i.e., praying coupled with studying and working well).Obviously, the Santos family is not a full enclosure unto itself. The members also have to carry out an outreach program. This consists mainly of “knowing more people,” and “developing friendship” with others including those from outside the family.These are pretty “standard” stuff for any normal family that aims to remain healthy and happy, with everyone becoming more accomplished and a greater asset not only for the family but also for society. But in the case of the Santos family, such standard stuff has been deployed and put to good, regular use and observance, and it must be added “with much fun and great sense of humor”.Except for the learning of Spanish project (but with the Mexico trip still done), all the family projects were executed, with great success in the end. A good example to emulate!",1
"Gen. Gregorio Lim Marine Base, Ternate: The establishment of the Philippine Marine Corps as a separate service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines is urgent to secure the country from external threats, former Marine officials said over the weekend.Former Marine captain and now Rep. Gary Alejano of Magdalo party-list and retired brigadier general Benjamin Espiritu made the call in connection with the pending bill in Congress establishing the Marine Corps as a branch that is distinct and autonomous, but complimentary to other branches of the military.The Marine Corps is currently under the Navy.“The Marine Corps has a distinct need from the Navy. The Marines is a highly mobile amphibious force which can be readily deployed anywhere in the archipelago, and we have the second largest coastline in the world,” Alejano told journalists.“This move should not give the impression that we want to do things our way alone. No, it is nothing like that. Having the Marine as a separate branch of service will enable the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Marines to focus well on their respective area of specialization but still jointly working together in protecting our country,” he said.He also lamented that the Marine Corps, while in existence for the last 68 years, was only created under a general order of the military chief in the 1950s, meaning it can be abolished anytime.“Our Marines have been serving our country to the best of their abilities for the last 68 years. We need to institutionalize their ranks by having them as a separate branch of service. Can you imagine that even after all those long years of dedicated service, you can be wiped off at any given time?,” Alejano said.Espiritu, chairman of the Philippine Marine Corps board of advisers and former 7th Marine Brigade Chief, could not agree more.“The Marine Corps as separate branch of service is the call of the times. Navy is focused more on protecting the seas, but as for the littorals of our country which has the second largest coastline in the world, that is the job for our Marines,” Espiritu pointed out in a separate interview with journalists.Littorals are the bodies of water lying along a shore.Espiritu noted that the funding for the Marine Corps as a separate branch of service need not be costly since its budget under the Navy could just be transferred to the corps for starters.“The Marines’ maintenance and other operating expenses only accounts for 7 percent of the Philippine Navy’s budget,” he argued.THREAT FROM CHINAAlejano earlier warned China is beginning its invasion of Philippine territory by installing anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles at Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef, and Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands.Espiritu disclosed that representatives from the Marine Corps have reached out to President Rodrigo Duterte for the certification of the pending bill in Congress as urgent.“The commandant [of the Marine Corps] has talked to the President and the chief executive said he has no objection about it, but the President said he has to consult with his senior military leaders. We hope he will certify that as an urgent measure because it is a call of a maritime nation to build a stronger armed forces,” Espiritu added.Certifying the measure as urgent means Congress can approve the measure on second and third reading on the same day.The House version of the bill was authored by Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez of Davao del Norte and House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas of Ilocos Sur, while the Senate version was filed by Senators Juan Edgardo Angara, Juan Miguel Zubiri and Nancy Binay.",1
"Senators slammed on Tuesday the move by state prosecutors to clear suspected drug lords Kerwin Espinosa and Peter Lim from drug charges, warning that the administration’s war on drugs would be adversely affected.They expressed hope that Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II would reverse the dismissal of the drug trafficking charges.But Vice President Leni Robredo wondered whether the Department of Justice (DOJ) still deserved to be trusted by the public.Robredo said the decision of a DOJ panel of prosecutors to dismiss the charges against Espinosa and Lim was frightening.“First of all, because one of them is a confessed drug pusher. In fact, one of them is a witness against Senator [Leila] de Lima who is saying they gave her money out of drugs. What does that say?” she told reporters.Congressional inquiryRobredo was referring to Espinosa, who claimed during a congressional inquiry that he had given millions of pesos to De Lima through her former driver Ronnie Dayan during her time as justice secretary.De Lima has been detained at a Philippine National Police facility in Camp Crame since February last year due to drug-related charges, which she calls “politically motivated and trumped-up.”Sen. Richard Gordon, whose blue ribbon committee investigated the allegations against Espinosa, also wondered why the administration was waging an antidrug war “only to dismiss” the cases of big fish.Gordon noted that during the Senate inquiry last year, Espinosa testified he was into the illegal drug trade, admitted to giving protection money to someone and narrated his life in prison where he had made drug deals.Advice to Mr. DuterteEspinosa, Lim and several others were absolved by a DOJ panel of prosecutors due to the alleged weak evidence presented by the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) and the “inconsistencies” in the testimony of its lone witness, Marcelo Adorco, who was also cleared of the charges.The resolution was issued on Dec. 20, 2017, but the media came to know about it only on Monday.Gordon said President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs would be hurt if the matter was not resolved properly. “I am advising the President … that he should look into this right away.”Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon doubted that Aguirre had not been informed by the DOJ panel of its decision to drop the charges against Lim and Espinosa.“Having said that, the President should review this, because the Office of the President has supervision and control over all Cabinet secretaries,” Drilon told reporters.Senators Grace Poe, Bam Aquino and Antonio Trillanes IV were convinced that the DOJ panel should have established probable cause to indict Espinosa and Lim for illegal drug trafficking.Sen. Panfilo Lacson said Espinosa at the least should have been charged based on the evidence that was presented in the Senate inquiry.PerplexingPoe said she was “disturbed” by the basis used by the DOJ panel in recommending the dismissal of the charges.“How a confessed drug lord like Kerwin Espinosa can be exonerated by the State, is perplexing. It reflects the sloppiness of the police’s investigation and case buildup against these drug lords,” Poe said in a statement.“Is the prosecution really searching for evidence?” she asked.For his part, Trillanes said the dropping of charges against the two suspected drug lords showed that Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs was fake.“If the person is poor, no more questions are asked and he is killed immediately,” Trillanes said in a statement.‘Fake war’“If the persons involved are drug lords and they are the compadre (wedding cosponsor) of Mr. Duterte, due process is observed and they are absolved.”Trillanes also noted that De Lima, a vocal critic of the President, ended up being charged in court even if the scripted testimony against her was all tangled.The Liberal Party (LP) also took the line of Trillanes.“If Kerwin Espinosa is not involved in drugs, then what reason remains for him to bribe Sen. Leila de Lima, as he claimed in his testimony? What reason remains for Senator De Lima to be in jail,” the LP said in a statement.The political party said De Lima was innocent of the illegal drug charges filed by the government against her.Justice for a fewThe exoneration of suspected drug lords has cast doubt on the administration’s antidrug war, Aquino said.“Justice is only for a few and not for each Filipino,” he said in a statement.Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said the dropping of the charges was a “blow to government credibility in its antidrug operations.”Sen. Win Gatchalian said the turn of events was a “big setback in achieving a drug-free society in our country.”Drug list unreliableMagdalo Rep. Gary Alejano noted that the basis of the alleged involvement of Espinosa and his father, the slain Albuera, Leyte Mayor Rolando Espinosa, in the illegal drug trade was Mr. Duterte’s drug list.Thus, he said, the DOJ’s dismissal of the complaint due to lack of evidence “is short of admitting that the drug list of Duterte is unfounded and unreliable.”Alejano also slammed the hypocrisy of the administration drug war. “Big-time drug lords are acquitted, while poor small-time drug users face death at an instant. This is supposedly how the ‘justice’ system works under the Duterte administration,” he said.Like Alejano, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said the dismissal of charges against Espinosa and Lim demonstrated the administration’s policy of selectiveness in implementing the law.“The policy of the Duterte administration is to liberate drug lords and liquidate small fry,” he told a news conference.Akbayan Rep. Tom Villarin, speaking at the same forum, said it was time to releaseDe Lima.“What is sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose. Senator De Lima has spent a year in detention even without a formal trial. If this is what happens, all the more the need to release the good senator,” he said.",1
"THE Department of Education (DepEd) under the watch of Secretary Leonor Briones on Monday said it is committed to improving the country’s basic education system, as it promised an active, transparent, consultative, collaborative and corruption-free leadership.The Education department is also committed to responding to reasonable economic demands of teachers and non-teaching personnel, Briones added.“We will also continue existing cooperation with the private sector and communities, as well as with bilateral and multilateral institutions toward the fulfillment of our vision and agenda,” she said in her keynote speech during the recently held education summit at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City (Metro Manila).According to the DepEd chief, she will expand Adopt-A-School project and other partnerships.“Thus, we will continue the efforts to get our school-age children to school, and to keep them in school up to completion of basic education. But for those who are not reached by the formal basic education system, the Department of Education under my term is determined to intensify and expand our Alternative Learning Systems [ALS] for out-of-school children, youth and adults whom we are unable to reintegrate to formal education,” Briones said.“We will do this through better targeting of beneficiaries, broader coverage and prioritization of these programs by implementing units, partnerships and modalities that fit the circumstances of target learners,” she added.Briones said the ALS program will be one of the major legacies of the Duterte administration.The Education department, under orders from President Rodrigo Duterte, has strengthened and enriched further curricular reforms in connection with the government’s war on illegal drugs, promotion of reproductive health and mitigation of disasters, Briones said.“Specifically, we are strengthening the drug education component in Science and Health by providing real-life lessons via alternative learning methods, starting in Grade 4,” she added.“We are strengthening gender and development component of school curricula especially in relation to sex education and teenage pregnancy. We are giving emphasis to environmental awareness, disaster preparedness and climate-change adaptation and mitigation,” the DepEd chief said.Briones promised to continue implementation of the K-to-12 [Kindergarten to Grade 12] basic education curriculum.“I have committed to pursue the full implementation of K-to-12. The program is not about simply adding school years to basic education to be at par with international norm but more about the content and the intended outcomes in terms of upgrading education quality,” she said.“The program involves the overhaul of our basic education curriculum to make every learner ready for higher education or for work anywhere, equipped with 21st century skills comprising learning and innovation skills; information, media and technology skills; effective communications skills; and life and career skills,” the DepEd chief added.Of the 25 million students in basic education, 21 million are in public schools, Briones said.“You can imagine the massive education inputs that we need to deliver on account of overhauling the curriculum and adding to the years of schooling, in terms of constructing new classrooms, hiring and training of teachers and providing textbooks, learning materials, laboratories and computer packages,” she added.Briones noted that the Duterte administration has allotted a bigger budget for the Education department for the next school year.“The administration has given its immediate response by proposing an unprecedented 31 percent increase in the DepEd budget for 2017, from P433.5 billion to P569 billion,” she said, adding that the proposed appropriation is now closer to the 4 to 6 of Gross Domestic Product ideal appropriation indicated by international standards.“This belies any notion that this government is by any measure abandoning public basic education in favor of privatization,” Briones, a former national treasurer, said.The DepEd chief noted that there was a drastic improvement in the department’s absorptive capacity.“As of June 30, 2016, of the P30.3 billion adjusted allotment, P17.6 billion remained unobligated. For the 2016 appropriations, of the P79.3 billion allotment for MOOE [maintenance and other operating expenses] and capital outlay, P63.9 billion remained unobligated,” she said.Breaking freeBriones added that she is committed to put in place financial management reforms to ensure availability and timely delivery of infrastructure and learning resources both for formal and non-formal education.“We are introducing greater leadership supervision and oversight over finance, administration and procurement. We are setting up an education program monitoring and delivery unit to monitor budget execution and coordinate timely interventions when bottlenecks arise,” she said.“We will develop and establish a financial management information system able to track the status of the department’s budget releases real time. We are now in the thick of planning our 2017 activities with the objectives of breaking free from the ‘catch up’ of budget execution that has so far characterized the department’s performance budget,” Briones added.She said she is open to experimenting with new ideas and pathways to innovation in teaching delivery and content that can maximize the full potential learners, noting that a liberating education should not overlook the development of soft skills.“Not all students can be doctors, scientists, engineers or lawyers. We need to find ways to understand the disposition and interests of our learners, including being artistically inclined, or wanting to take up sports, and be able to offer avenues and teaching support to make those interests flourish,” Briones added.“In the current context of work that requires problem solving, working with people and communities, working in teams and working in different cultural settings, we need teachers who are able to teach and train our learners to effectively communicate, collaborate and adapt,” the DepEd chief explained.Briones said she is seeking to strengthen ties with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Tesda) to fully address problems of deteriorating quality education in the country.“To be frank, we have had limited interaction with our attached agencies in the few months that we have been in office. Let this summit start to change that, and find among us greater mutual relevance and reason for common work,” she added.“I will conclude by emphasizing the need for us in the education sector, especially the three lead agencies of DepEd, CHED and Tesda to coordinate better. It is abundantly clear that we face common challenges in society, economy and environment. None of us can meet these challenges alone,” the DepEd chief added.“Be it in providing pre-service and in-service education and training of our teachers, undertaking research and development, linking with the national and global economy, forging stronger ties with industry or working for common qualifications standards, and all these require us to work together and in a coherent manner,” Briones said.This year’s summit aims to define the medium and long-term education vision and agenda for the trifocal education system—basic education, technical-vocational education and tertiary education.The summit also tackled other issues such as linkage of education and the economy; human resource and management issues in education; understanding the condition and needs of learners to guide intervention; digital education and use of technology in the knowledge and information age; higher education as a force of social and cultural transformation; and higher education as accelerator of innovation and inclusive economic prosperity.",1
"Former Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat, known in the military as a warrior who tried to quell the rebellion in Central Mindanao when it was just starting in the 1970s, passed away on Wednesday night. He was 92.His eldest son, Victor, said that Abat had been confined at Veterans Memorial Medical Center since Jan. 25.“His heart was giving up,” he added.Old age finally caught up with the man who, in many respects, was part of the country’s history.In a statement, Department of National Defense (DND) spokesperson Arsenio Andolong said the DND “mourns the loss of (the) former Defense Secretary and commanding general of the Philippine Army … We thank him for his service to the nation.”Abat, a member of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Class of 1951, was married to the former Corazon Bulatao, a teacher from San Carlos, Pangasinan. They had six children.Musing on his father’s long life, Victor described it as “already a bonus.”Former President Fidel Ramos, who fought in the Korean War with Abat, managed to visit his longtime friend and key ally in the hospital. Abat later became Ramos’ defense secretary for nine months, until Ramos’ term ended on June 30, 1998.Peace negotiatorBefore taking on the defense portfolio, Abat served as chief peace negotiator for the Ramos administration’s talks with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which led to a peace agreement.(The Moro Islamic Liberation Front [MILF]",1
"Former Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago, who as commissioner cleaned up the corruption-ridden immigration bureau and battled Yakuza criminal gangs, earning for her the Asian version of the Nobel Prize and the adulation of a grateful nation that voted her to the Senate three times but thrice rejected her as possibly the best President the country never had, died on Thursday. She was 71.The senator’s death, after a two-year bout with lung cancer, was announced by her husband, Narciso Santiago.“I accept this. I do not want to do anything heroic,” the husband quoted Santiago as saying before she succumbed in her final battle against the Big C that hobbled her last campaign for the presidency in May. She had been unconscious for several days before that.“She died peacefully in her sleep. That is all I want to remember,” he said.The remains will be moved to Immaculate Concepcion Cathedral in Cubao, Quezon City.At the Meet Inquirer Multimedia forum on May 3, Santiago appeared in top form, a far cry from her distracted demeanor and subdued sound bites during the campaign. She said she had been in remission. “It means the cancer cells, which are normally repugnant because they eat everybody around them,” she began, before putting in: “Some people are like cancer cells.”The crowd roared.On the presidencyThe senator recalled how the initial cancer treatment drained her to a point she thought about giving up her candidacy. “I knew I can afford it at the initial stages, but it will leave me broke and dying anyway. So I said (to the Lord), take me now,” she said, gripping the bottom of her chair and looking up.Had she won, Santiago said she would have run the country “like a strict mother,” who placed a premium on discipline, the civic spirit and nationhood. She quipped “Wala (nobody)!” when asked who among the other presidential candidates was best qualified for the job.“[The next President] should have academic excellence, professional excellence and moral excellence or no record of corruption,” Santiago said in February.As immigration commissioner, Santiago ordered the arrest and deportation of criminal syndicates, including those engaged in illegally procuring infants for adoption in Europe and those procuring “mail-order brides” and “entertainers” for prostitution abroad.Death threats“I eat death threats for breakfast,” she once famously said, earning her a reputation as a tough, no-nonsense official battling the Japanese Yakuza gangsters.Santiago served as presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court in Quezon City in 1983-1987, was appointed immigration commissioner in 1988-1989 and later as agrarian reform secretary in 1989. She was elected senator for three six-year terms—1995-2001, 2004-2010, and 2010-2016.As a lawmaker, she filed the highest number of bills and authored some of the most important laws. Her most important pending bills included the antidynasty bill; an act institutionalizing an age-appropriate curriculum to prevent the abduction, exploitation and sexual abuse of children; freedom of information bill; and Magna Carta for Philippine internet freedom.In December 2011, Santiago was the first Filipino and Asian from a developing state to be elected judge to the International Criminal Court for a nine-year term. In June 2014, however, she waived the privilege after she was diagnosed with cancer.Claiming that she had “licked” cancer, Santiago ran for President in May 2016 under the People’s Reform Party. She ran and lost in 1992 and in 1998.“I won in the voting but lost in the counting,” Santiago recalled when she finished a very close second to President Fidel Ramos 24 years ago. Ramos garnered 5.34 million votes while she collected 4.47 million—a difference of less than a million.‘Stupid is Forever’In 2005, she relaunched her best-selling book, “Stupid is Forevermore,” a sequel to “Stupid is Forever.” The books are compilations of her witty one-liners on a range of topics, including politics, religion, morality and romance.Commenting on her appeal to the youth, Santiago said: “I think that they like the idea that there is a person who prefers to stand against the tide if that is dictated by the rule of law.”Santiago earned her bachelor of arts degree, magna cum laude, and her bachelor of laws, cum laude, from the University of the Philippines. She earned the graduate degrees of master of laws and doctor of juridicial science from the University of Michigan where she was a Barbour Scholar and DeWitt Fellow. She also finished master of arts in religious studies at Maryhill School of Theology.Among the citations she received include one of “The 100 Most Powerful Women in the World” by The Australian magazine in 1996; Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service in 1988 “for bold and moral leadership in cleaning up a graft-ridden government agency.”Santiago was born on June 15, 1945, in Iloilo City to Benjamin Defensor, a presiding judge at a regional trial court, and Dimpna Palma, a college dean.She was married to Narciso Santiago Jr. and had two sons, Narciso III and Alexander (deceased).",1
"President Rodrigo Duterte is in “tip-top condition” to lead the country in the next four years, his top aide assured the public, amid concerns about the Chief Executive’s health.In a radio interview, Special Assistant to the President Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go said there was nothing to worry about Duterte’s health condition following a routine medical checkup at the Cardinal Santos Medical Center on Sunday, the night before his State of the Nation Address (SONA).“First, it is the right of every Filipino to know the health condition of the President. He is in tip-top condition to lead our country in the next four years. So there is nothing to worry about,” Go said in Filipino during an interview with dzRH radio.“It was reported that he went to the hospital last Sunday. It was just a routine checkup and we have seen in the last SONA [State of the Nation Address], the President was calm and is in a usual mood so do not worry, our President is very healthy),” he added.Go made the assurance a day after Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. denied talks on the internet that Duterte was rushed to the hospital.“There is no truth the rumors that the President was rushed to the hospital. It is tsismis (gossip). It is fake news.The President is fine. Although he went to have a regular checkup the night before the SONA he has not been toany medical facility since,” Roque told reporters during a press briefing in Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay.“It is in fact a crime to spread this kind of news. There is no truth to these rumors and he will in fact be here in Ipil to lead the celebration for Araw ng Ipil. So his appearance will belie all these false reports,” he added.The President’s health has been the subject of much speculation, but he and Malacañang have repeatedly downplayed such concerns.The 73-year-old Duterte has admitted to suffering from various ailments, including Barrett’s esophagus, which impacts his throat, and Buerger’s disease, caused by heavy smoking in younger days.Last month, Duterte said he threw up during his flight from Seoul, South Korea due to migraine.",1
"The Philippines should just have five federal states in order for it to succeed in its planned shift to federalism, an Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) official said on Wednesday.Lawyer Randolph Parcasio, consultant to ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman, made the pitch during a public hearing on the situation of autonomous regions as a prelude to federalism conducted by the House Committee on Constitutional Amendments.“Each federal state must be able to stand on its own. If we will have 15 or 14 regional or federal states, there will be rich and poor states, and as such, we will need an equalization fund. We can’t afford to have such rich and beggar states,” Parcasio told lawmakers.“It would be ideal if we will have five federal states: Mindanao, Visayas and three in Luzon. This way, every state can stand on its own,” he said.The three federal states in Luzon will be Metro Manila, Calabarzon-Bicol Region and Northern Luzon-Central Luzon, including Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) .“This is an initial step. In the event that members of a certain federal state feel that they are already economically viable to form a separate federal state, then the law should allow them to apply to become one, much like how municipalities apply to become cities,” Parcasio said.He is one of the three resource persons who attended the hearing from the ARMM. The other two were also lawyers: Ishak Mastura, chairman of the ARMM Board of Investments; and Anwar Malang, secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry in ARMM.The resource persons from CAR are: Baguio City Mayor Mauricio Domogan, also the chairman of the Cordillera Regional Development Council; Director Milagros Rimando, vice Cchairman of the RDC-CAR; and Marlo Iringan, an engineer and regional director of the Department of the Interior and Local Government-CAR.The Duterte administration is pushing for a Constitutional Assembly wherein lawmakers of the House of Representatives and the Senate will amend the Constitution and install a federal form of government that would be composed of 11 independent states under a federal government.Each federal state will have the authority to craft its laws, as well as manage its resources, but would still have to split its income, with 25 percent going to the national government and 75 percent to the concerned region since the national government will retain its full jurisdiction on foreign affairs, national defense, police and monetary policy.",1
"MANILA, Philippines – Voting 16-4, senators of the 17th Congress ousted neophyte Senator Leila De Lima as the chairperson of the Senate committee on justice and human rights.Only 2 senators abstained: Minority Leader Ralph Recto and minority Senator Francis Escudero.Recto manifested that they deemed it best to leave the decision to the majority, as that is not the issue of the minority bloc.The ouster of De Lima came after she presented in a hearing on Thursday, September 15, Edgar Matobato, a self-confessed hitman of the Davao Death Squad, who accused President Rodrigo Duterte of ordering killings when he was still mayor.Moments before the voting, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano delivered a privilege speech blaming De Lima and her allies for “misleading” international media on the real status of the extrajudicial killings in the country.After Cayetano’s speech, neophyte Senator Emmanuel Pacquiao, a party mate of the President, stood up and moved that the chamber declare the committee vacant.De Lima got the ire of Duterte for launching a probe into the spate of summary executions under his administration.",0
"Whenever the fantasy genre is mentioned in the Philippines, the first things that come to most people’s minds is stuff like Enteng Kabisonte or Panday. Of course, there’s the crowd who still remembers Encantadia well, but these are few and far between nowadays as there are more and more “pantaseryes” (fantasy soap operas) that come out on a near annual basis on Philippine TV. Unfortunately, despite being marketed as fantasy, typical pantaseryes don’t differ all that much from the usual teleserye with your damsel and distress who gets rescued by a prince charming who solves all her problems for her without her having to lift a finger.Anyway, today, I’m gonna tell you a nice, true-to-life story…Once upon a time, there was this guy named Andrzej Sapkowski, a Polish man who took an interest in the sci-fi and fantasy genre. A marketing expert, he sought to popularize his own brand of fantasy which was notably quite dark and began with the title The Witcher. Then, much to his surprise, his stories flourished not just in his home country of Poland but overseas as well thanks to being adapted into several video games. Indeed, the success of The Witcher franchise is so profound that it’s often been compared to other memorable fantasy franchises like Berserk and The Elder Scrolls series.But enough of Mr. Sapkowski, I’m sure the lot of you just want to know what all this hullabaloo about The Witcher is all about. Well then, I suppose there’s no helping it now…The Witcher focuses on the story of Geralt of Rivia, the titular “Witcher” of the franchise. Witchers, as explained in the book, were once ordinary humans who, through a series of genetic and chemical modification as well as grueling training were transformed into the ultimate monster hunter. Geralt is not the only one of his kind (indeed, there are others which include his mentor throughout most of the series) and their main purpose in the world is simply to hunt monsters that are plaguing their lands.However, the land they live in isn’t your typical fantasy setting though, what with corrupt nobles reigning over fiefdoms like they were their own backyard with the locals being nothing more than their pet dogs. Worse, said nobles couldn’t care less about the threats so long as they stay in power regardless whether they’re a foreign army bent on pillaging the populace or otherworldly monsters seeking to devour the souls of innocent people. It is all too often up to hardened individuals like Geralt, other Witchers similar to him or simply common people fed up with being victimized, to defend others too weak to defend themselves.An Unconventional HeroTruth be told, Geralt is a very interesting character on his own which makes him similar to what ChinoF mentions as a self-made hero. Of course, there are his physical modifications that render him stronger, faster and resistant or even human to various poisons compared to your basic human but one can see his often pragmatic approach to solving problems and fighting monsters. It is very rare for him to fight just with strength and relies more on well-prepared traps and meticulously devised strategies rather than just solely on his superhuman abilities.Geralt, as well as his fellow Witchers are interesting because of how their bodily changes affect them and how they see the world. For one thing, their higher emotions are often paralyzed or slowed, creating the often wrong impression that they are psychotic killers. While they certainly do not flinch from doing dirty work like brutally killing monsters, majority of them still have their consciences intact and sometimes have greater morals than the nobles who more or less treat their own people like garbage. That said, Witchers will often do what is right but do not expect them to show any overt emotion over it and they will sometimes demand pay especially if the job is particularly difficult or dangerous but usually only when there is a noble nearby to demand from.Moral AmbiguityThe people of the setting aren’t your typical side characters in a story, as you may well notice. They are rarely flat and easy to understand. For instance, in one game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, there was this military officer who was actually more than a little understanding of the common people. While he was an officer of some kind, he was quite gracious and once told a common peasant that he was no different from him and that he could speak freely in his presence. Unfortunately, when the same peasant didn’t uphold his end of their deal, the said officer ordered the man to be flogged for his troubles. When Geralt confronted the officer about it, all he had to say was that it was law and that he was expected to fulfill it.You’ll find a wealth of characters similar to the military officer mentioned above which isn’t at all that different from the way people are in real life. While people try to be good, we cannot always expect them to be perfect and, more often than not, they fall too easily to temptation. In a world of morally ambiguous characters, the only way to survive and make a difference is to live one’s life the way they want to and make decisions for themselves no matter how hard or perilous they may seem.An Honest SettingWhile the world of The Witcher might seem like your typical fantasy setting, it presents a rather bleak deconstruction of what can often be found in typical fairy tales. It is a world wherein happy endings might be possible but only attainable if one is willing to fight for it. They are very seldom what they seem to be and a lot of characters often meet gruesome ends for simply thinking that they can solve all their problems by marrying a handsome prince or doing a given favor for a feudal lord. While certainly fantastic, The Witcher presents a world that is all too real and believable.",0
"Malacañang on Thursday, February 2 said that despite both parties lifting ceasefire, the peace talks between the government and the rebels will still continue.Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said there was an apparent disconnect between the rebel leaders negotiating with the government and the leaders on the ground, leading to the lifting of the ceasefire.“Despite the untenable circumstances on the ground, the peace talks have not yet been scuttled. The road to peace is not an easy journey,” Abella said in a text message, Friday night, February 3.“Some progress had already been made during the third round of peace talks in Rome, but apparently there is some disconnect between dissident leaders negotiating at the table and their forces on the ground. It would be deeply regrettable that the otherwise positive developments now might have to be set aside,” he added.On Friday, President Duterte lifted the unilateral ceasefire with Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF), just two days after the rebels announced that they will withdraw their unilateral ceasefire next week.However, despite saying that he will take his time to think what he should do next, Duterte lifted the ceasefire after three soldiers were killed in an ambush on February 1.“Peace with the communists cannot be achieved in our generation. I have lost so many soldiers in the past 48 hours, I think to continue with the ceasefire will not produce anything,” Duterte lamented during the launching of Solar Powered Irrigation System Area in M’lang, North Cotabato.He also apologized to the military and ordered them to return to their camps, clean their rifles, and prepared to fight.According to Abella, the soldiers, who had just received their wages, were shot and killed viciously by the rebels.Abella also quoted an unnamed army officer commented that the ambush was a “complete disregard” for NPA’s announcement that they would recall its ceasefire only by 10 February.",1
A facebook fan page revealed that t-shirt printed with “Corazon Aquino Saint of Democracy” were being sold in America.Community Newswatch Philippines questioned the purpose of the t-shirts and they believe that the opposition is already preparing for mass demonstration locally and abroad to oust the Duterte administration which busy in fighting criminality and corruption in the Philippines.“It seemed there is a well-orchestrated plan to oust President Duterte by making people fall into the call of Cory as Saint of Democracy and eventually ask the people’s support to join Anti-Marcos Rally but the real issue is to remove President Duterte and ask VP Leni Robredo to replace and lead the country.” The fan page wrote.The t-shirts sold abroad is an evidence that the camp of the Vice President was engaged in an activity to oust the President of the Philippines.The opposition faced a big controversy because of the discovered exchange of mails between the supporters of Vice President Leni Robredo.The mails showed the alleged plan of the opposition to demonstrate rallies and spread message on social media against the current government and defeated Vice Presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos.The controversy sparked outrage to the Netizens and complained the lack of mainstream media’s attention on the issue.,0

"Amid a European Union expressing its critical concerns on current government policy, and foreign media outlets expressing disapproval of the government’s efforts to eradicate the illegal drugs business, a delegation composed of British companies led by Ambassador Asif Ahmad visited the president’s hometown in Davao.Earlier, United States Ambassador Sung Kim also returned to the southern metropolis to attend a meeting of the reinvigorated and expanded American Chamber of Commerce in Mindanao bearing the good news about 3.5 billion pesos worth of aid for the island’s agriculture.At no time in recent history have successive visits of this nature occurred in Mindanao, a place often avoided by them due to safety and security issues. The significance of their visits, and their intent bears a good look.Seeing through spicy rhetoric played up in the international press, these countries are now playing a longer game of partnership, rather than short match tit-for-tat. They see long-term benefit fruiting as they sieze the potentials of the large, young, and increasingly affluent economy which can provide not only inputs and labor, but capital as well. It must be noted that the Filipino Emperador group now owns the British whisky brand Whyte and McKaY.Observers note that the affable and intelligent British ambassador has connected extremely well with Filipinos, which observers say is due to broad experience encouraging trade in many countries and helped by his Asian heritage.Likewise making a connection is the United States Ambassador, who is of Korean ancestry. He also has extensive policy experience.How well these personal backgrounds serve as they deal with ASEAN governments like the Philippines will be tested in the coming years, as their economies struggle to overcome their own challenges in a competitive global marketplace. Deepening trade ties with a high -growth country like the Philippines will boost their own country’s economic prospects.Thus, where once occidental links and networks served Asians well, being Asian has today become an asset to connect to a continent that is poised to lead the world economy, now spreading its influence in politics and culture. It is not surprising therefore, if their respective foreign relations establishments are consistently cultivating an internal expertise on ASEAN or Philippine affairs.On that note, it goes without saying that the Philippines is ASEAN’s front door to the northern Asian economies, and a vital crossroad between Southeast and Northern Asia. Recent discussions on the West Philippine Sea and the Benham Rise issues catapult the once sick man of Asia into the global limelight.Moreover, that President Duterte leads in an international news magazine’s man of the year poll is a testament to his having successfully framed discussions and pushed his country’s agenda to the main stage of world opinion.In an increasingly complicated post-Obama world, asserting your nation’s interest seems to be the rage. The acerbic opinion of a few is met with wide support reflected in the trust and support of almost 9 in 10 Filipinos in opinion polls.To illustrate this, recent mass actions by his supporters in the nation’s capital against a critical Vice President, following a previous one show a broad base of mobilizable support that disproves the allegations of other critics who claim that the support base is made up of “online trolls.”A lesson to be learned is that comments “stronger” to “weaker” countries can be as unwelcome and unsavory as nuclear aggression or bullying from afar. Threats like removing tariffs in exchange for adjusting domestic policies will always be rejected by locals. Worse, they emasculate the real message which is to expand trade.This begs the question: Will possible sanctions push stronger economic ties, or is this just partisan talk by special interest or pressure groups? If the latter is true, then a sad commentary is that some foreign governments joining the chorus of criticism are easily influenced with inaccurate data.Moreover, they can also be seen as the result of a political opposition’s lobby among foreign friends to criticize their own governments. These countries should be careful when dealing with detractors, lest they fall prey to the kind of false information peddled to foreign media.Already, a few have uncovered the truth behind the “kill rates” quoted by opposition groups – they aren’t as appalling and compelling when examined – because they are bloated to include those who may have never taken drugs.Thus, assertive speech from former colony can be appalling in the same way a former servant suddenly talks back at his abusive former master – the servant will be cheered.For reactions: facebook.com/johntriapage",1

"Aside from the bridges, massive projects worth at least P123.68 billion are being undertaken by the Duterte administration for the Visayas.Some were started or identified by the previous administration.These are the P7.9-billion Leyte Tide Embankment Project, which covers 27.3 kilometers from the shore of Barangay Diit in Tacloban City to Tanauan town, both in Leyte province.The project aims to protect the province from storm surges. In 2013, surges pummeled Tacloban when Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) struck.By August, the new Bohol (Panglao) airport worth P4.5 billion will be operational.The new world-class passenger terminal building at Mactan Cebu International Airport in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu province, opened in June.Ongoing projects include:The Bacolod Economic Highway, a 21.8-km, four-lane road with three bridges and a two-way bike lane that would serve as an alternative circumferential road bypassing the busy Bacolod City Central District; andThe 73.75-km Metro Cebu Expressway connecting Danao City in the north to Naga City in the south.Expected to begin this year is the new Cebu International Container Port, a P9.2-billion project which aims to add 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) container yard capacity to the Cebu International Port.It will be built on 25 hectares of reclaimed land at Barangay Tayud, Consolacion town, with a 500-meter berth to accommodate two 2,000-TEU vessels, four quay cranes and superstructures (operation building, gate complex, weigh bridge, maintenance factory), and a 1,450-meter inland access road and 300-meter offshore bridge.In the pipeline are the maintenance and development projects for the Bacolod and Iloilo airports to start next year, and the establishment of a night rating at the Dumaguete airport in Negros Oriental province.Part of the “Build Build Build” infrastructure program is the Central Spine Roro Alignment Project, which seeks to align the road and sea linkages through the roll-on, roll-off system from the Batangas Port down to Cagayan de Oro City.",1

"As much as I appreciate President Rodrigo Duterte trying to change the status quo, I doubt he can change all of them. They are so ingrained in our culture, that people will (wrongly) feel cheated and “oppressed”.Take our government construction projects, for example. When a project is awarded to the contractor, the mayor, the congressman, and the governor automatically get 10% of the project’s budget at the very least. That, then, jeopardizes the project’s quality because the budget received a massive cut.And I kid you not, if you eradicate this system, people benefiting from this will actually feel cheated. Even speaking out against this system (if you’re a government employee) may get you fired. I wouldn’t put it beneath them to kill the person responsible for completely removing this system if it were to happen.I’ve seen government employees get frustrated and angry at the thought of them not getting bribes. Speak up against bribery aggressively and you’ll find yourself being ganged up by your co-workers. Some managers go as far as trying to ruin the image of this person. As if you’re suddenly the spawn of Satan trying to deny these people their well-deserved money.Now I’m not saying we shouldn’t do anything about it. All I’m saying is there may be career-threatening and life-threatening challenges ahead of us if we choose to completely eradicate these type of systems.-----------------------This is a GRP Featured Comment.

"The Duterte administration’s new source of financing for its ambitious infrastructure projects, China, could lead the Philippines into a “debt trap” as it did other countries that had borrowed heavily from the Asian giant, according to Vice President Leni Robredo.Robredo cited the project to build a new Bicol Express, a rail system connecting Manila and Bicol region, for P175 billion, which would come from a Chinese loan.Robredo said there should be a better way to finance the project other than through loans from China.“First of all, it’s debt. Very huge, P171 billion. That’s very huge,” said Robredo, who is a native of Naga. “Our fear is we might get stuck in a debt trap like the one experienced by Sri Lanka,” she said.According to BBC.com, Sri Lanka had relied so heavily on loans, mostly from China, that 95 percent of all government revenues now go to debt repayment alone.Many of the projects funded by Chinese loans turned out to be nonprofitable, according to the BBC.com report.Alternatives“Of course, if it’s debt, we will be the ones to bear the burden. It should be decided on properly,” Robredo said.But Robredo said it seemed like economic managers, who had presented financing models for the rail projects, “were no longer looking at any alternative.”She said she had asked Cesar Chavez, a former dzRH reporter and transportation undersecretary, and Mercedita Sombillo, assistant economic planning secretary, to look at alternatives and “give us what’s the most favorable for all.”Robredo said that while she was not opposed to China’s role in the “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure plan of President Duterte, concerns had been raised about the profitability of some of the projects.She said the proposal of three private companies that had expressed interest on the Bicol rail project as a private-public partnership (PPP) was also worth looking at. She did not identify the companies, though.Duterte’s friends“Why not look at that?” Robredo said. She said that if the government waited to settle concerns about “profiting” by the private firms, the process “might take longer.”Mr. Duterte had cozied up to China and Russia after ranting at the United States, the Philippines’ traditional ally, largely as a result of US officials’ criticism of summary killings that became part of Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs.Mr. Duterte’s predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, had tried to promote the PPP model as a means to build key infrastructure without spending government money.",1
